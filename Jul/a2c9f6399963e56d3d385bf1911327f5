Boris Johnson has become the new prime minister, promising to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by completing Brexit with a deal by 31 October. Standing outside Downing Street after seeing the Queen, he promised the “buck stops with me” on Brexit. He also set out a series of domestic priorities including more money for schools, hospital upgrades, police and social care. Johnson pledged to get a deal with the EU but also to increase readiness for a no-deal Brexit, saying there had been “three years of unfounded self-doubt” under Theresa May’s government. After being invited by the Queen to form a government, Johnson told the nation: “I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service. “But in spite of all her efforts, it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think after three years of indecision that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a democratic mandate. “And so I am standing before you today, to tell you the British people, that those critics are wrong – the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters are going to get it wrong again.”
