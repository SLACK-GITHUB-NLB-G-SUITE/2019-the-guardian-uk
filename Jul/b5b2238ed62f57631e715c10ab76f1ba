This is all very jolly. Jez Bond and Mark Cameron have written a parody whodunnit where at each performance a hitherto secret guest celebrity takes on the part of the Inspector while having their lines fed to them through an earpiece. Since they have never seen the script before, everything hinges on their quick-wittedness and at the matinee I saw, Gyles Brandreth – one of 22 performers assuming the role in a two-week fundraising run – overcame the potential hazards with characteristic aplomb. Two things strike me about the venture. One is that, as with Noises Off, we now delight in the send-up of genres that have virtually vanished: with the exception of The Mousetrap, the kind of country house murder mystery thriller here being spoofed is a thing of the past. The other point is that, as the success of The Play That Goes Wrong proves, audiences get high on the possibility of mishap: in fact, little does go amiss here, since the permanent cast keep the show on the road. Brandreth, who always reminds me of a defrocked cleric, copes stoically with everything thrown at him. He lapses at one point into Hungarian, nimbly executes a dance routine and even offers his own ad libs: obliged to nestle up to an audience member who plays a cameo role, he wryly observes: “It’s the 1950s – I can get this close.” Brandreth paid due tribute, at the curtain call, to Robert Blackwood, who fed him the lines and, among the regular cast, Patrick Ryecart as a befuddled aristo and Candida Gubbins as a suspect housekeeper stand out. I wouldn’t want the idea of celebrity guests to catch on but, if it helps the Park theatre to prosper, it is all in a good cause. • At Park theatre, London, until 27 July.
