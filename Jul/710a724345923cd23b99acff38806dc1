Train passengers across the UK have been advised to avoid travelling if possible, as extreme temperatures plunged the rail network into chaos. Many services were cancelled as train operators and Network Rail warned the system could not cope with the searing heat. Severe speed restrictions have been imposed due to concern that track temperatures could reach nearly 60C (140F) and buckle, putting trains at risk of derailing. Speeds have been reduced to 20mph on some parts of the rail system and Network Rail, which manages Britain’s 20,000 miles of steel track, said it had activated “extreme weather action teams” to minimise disruption. The teams have been painting some parts of the track white to cool it down, a measure that can reduce the temperature by up to 10C. Network Rail says it stress tests its steel rail at 27C, which will be comfortably exceeded in large parts of the UK on Thursday. At least 15 rail operators urged commuters to avoid travel altogether, or to set off early if they could not. East Midlands Trains told passengers: “We strongly recommend you do not travel today.” London North Eastern Railway, which runs the east coast mainline from London King’s Cross to Scotland, advised passengers not to travel on trains that were likely to be extremely busy. “We strongly advise you to avoid travelling, if you can,” said Southeastern, which runs trains between London and Kent. Greater Anglia, which operates services in Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, advised against travel “unless absolutely necessary”. Other operators to predict disruption included Virgin Trains, Thameslink, the TransPennine Express, Great Northern, Great Western, Gatwick Express, Grand Central, CrossCountry, London Overground, London Northwestern and Hull Trains.
