Eddie Hearn has insisted Dillian Whyte was cleared to fight ahead of last weekend’s heavyweight showdown against Oscar Rivas, after reports emerged claiming he had tested positive for a banned substance. The 31-year-old outpointed Rivas at the 02 Arena to secure the WBC title and move himself into the sphere inhabited by Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder. Whyte, who has recorded 10 successive victories since the only defeat of his career to Joshua in 2016, is now the mandatory challenger for Deontay Wilder’s WBC belt. On Wednesday, however, website Boxing Scene alleged that Whyte failed a test for a banned substance on 17 July. Hearn, Whyte’s promoter, responded on Twitter, saying: “Further to reports I can confirm that both Dillian Whyte and Oscar Rivas were subject to extensive Vada and Ukad testing for their bout. Both fighters were cleared to fight by both bodies and the BBBofC.” Ukad declined to comment when approached by the Press Association. The British Boxing Board of Control and Matchroom have also been approached for comment. Whyte was previously banned for two years in 2012 after he was found to have taken a banned substance, methylhexaneamine, which he insisted he took unwittingly.
