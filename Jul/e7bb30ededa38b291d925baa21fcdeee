The environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion are planning week-long demonstrations by targeting five UK cities; London, Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow and Cardiff. The coalition are calling on the government to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse emissions to zero by 2025. As part of what the group are calling a “summer uprising”, activists are blocking roads in several city centres. In London people gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice and set up a blue boat, Bristol bridge has been closed after a pink boat has been installed there and a major road has been blocked by a purple boat in the centre of Glasgow.
