An outstanding renewal of the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes fully lived up to its pre-race billing here on Saturday as Enable stayed on strongly to beat Crystal Ocean by a neck after a head-to-head duel between the two horses throughout the final quarter-mile. Crystal Ocean struck for home at the two-furlong pole but Enable and Frankie Dettori had made rapid strides from the rear to join issue. There was never more than a neck in it until the line but Enable, the 8-15 favourite, finally settled the issue a few strides from the post. Waldgeist, from Andre Fabre’s stable in France, finished third.¬† Saturday’s win was Enable’s 11th straight success in a sequence dating back to May 2017 which includes victories in the last two runnings of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. She remains a strong favourite to add an unprecedented third success in Europe’s most prestigious race this October, although the narrow margin of her latest win persuaded Paddy Power to ease her odds to 13-8 from 6-4. The pair battled for the last quarter-final with little between them and it was only in the final 100 yards the queen of the turf managed to seal the race and come home a neck clear. Dettori said: “She was brilliant. The second is a great horse, but we gave the public what they came to see. They got a fantastic horse race.
