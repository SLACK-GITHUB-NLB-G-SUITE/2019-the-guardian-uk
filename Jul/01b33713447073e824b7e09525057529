Mason Mount has become the latest Chelsea youngster to commit his long-term future to the club after signing a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge. The midfielder follows Ruben Loftus-Cheek in signing a new deal through to the summer of 2024 at least, with the Europa League winners hopeful Callum Hudson-Odoi, still a target for Bayern Munich, will soon follow suit. Mount, who has yet to represent the Chelsea first-team in a competitive game, has enjoyed time on loan at Vitesse Arnhem and spent last season impressing under Frank Lampard at Derby County in the Championship. The 20-year-old’s form in the second tier earned him a call-up into Gareth Southgate’s full England squad last autumn – he has yet to be capped at that level, but has represented the under-21s – and he scored for Lampard’s Chelsea side in Saturday’s 4-0 win over St Patrick’s Athletic in Dublin. Mount has since travelled to Japan with the senior squad for the forthcoming friendlies against Kawasaki Frontale and Barcelona. “It’s a massively proud moment for myself and my family,” said Mount, who joined Chelsea’s academy at the age of six. “I joined this club at six years old and it was always my goal to play for the first team one day. I’m really looking forward to the coming season now and working hard to have an impact here at Chelsea. I’ve been at the club for a long time already and hopefully I’ll stay for a long time to come.” “Mason has come right the way through the Chelsea academy and has always stood out as a fantastic talent and dedicated individual,” said the Chelsea director, Marina Granovskaia. “We have monitored his development extremely closely while he has been out on loan and believe he is now ready to be a member of our squad competing at the top of the Premier League. Like another of our academy graduates, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, we are delighted Mason has committed himself to the club this summer and look forward to an exciting future ahead.”
