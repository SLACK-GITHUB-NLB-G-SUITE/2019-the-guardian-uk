The idea that a state school can “scrap” GCSE chemistry because “the lab is expensive to maintain” (Letters, 8 July) is mistaken. All state secondary schools in England are required to teach science (biology, chemistry and physics) as a core subject leading to a national qualification. All three science subjects must be studied. Maybe the writer, like me, is remembering those days 50 years ago when my grammar school allowed students to just take biology on the grounds that it was easy!Dr Amanda HipkissLudlow, Shropshire • The line “Infamy, Infamy, they’ve all got it in for me” from Carry on Cleo (Carry On films celebrated the working class in its heyday, 4 July) was actually originally coined by the radio comedy writers Frank Muir and Dennis Norden for the 1950s Take It From Here show.Steve GriffithsWatchet, Somerset • As a retired civil servant I was delighted to find that the general secretary of the FDA union provides a fine example of nominative determinism, with his surname of Penman (Letters, 6 July).Jane MothSnettisham, Norfolk • Was it a deliberate mistake to have no clue for J in Saturday’s alphabetical crossword?
