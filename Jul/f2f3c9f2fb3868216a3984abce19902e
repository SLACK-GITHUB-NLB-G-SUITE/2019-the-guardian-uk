A black MEP claims he was asked to leave the European parliament building in Strasbourg by an official on his first day. Magid Magid, 30, who represents Yorkshire and the Humber for the Green party, said he was “visibly different” but would not “try to fit in”. The former lord mayor of Sheffield, who wore a baseball cap and T-shirt reading “f**k fascism”, claimed he had been asked to leave the parliament building during the opening day of the new legislature. Your face when you've just had someone ask if you're lost & then you're told to leave, on your first day at work. 🤦🏾‍♂️I know I'm visibily different. I don't have the privilege to hide my identity. I'm BLACK & my name is Magid. I don't intend to try fit in. Get used to it! 👊🏾💚 pic.twitter.com/HhWG63kE9U Magid, who was elected as one of six MEPs for the Yorkshire and the Humber region in May, said he did not know the identity of the person who asked him to leave, although he believed the individual was an official. He said the person asked if he was lost and then suggested he leave. “I know I’m visibily [sic] different. I don’t have the privilege to hide my identity. I’m BLACK & my name is Magid. I don’t intend to try fit in. Get used to it,” he tweeted. After receiving messages of support, Magid said: “Just to clarity [sic], I obviously didn’t leave. But to even be put in this position says a lot about what people think the stereotypical politician is meant to look like.” Magid suggested his physical appearance made “people feel uncomfortable”. He added: “MEPs don’t reflect the people that they represent, Europe-wide and I know i’m gonna stick out like a sore thumb.” However, the European parliament said no member of staff was involved in the incident. “We investigated the matter immediately after our attention was brought to it and can safely say that no member of parliament staff was involved,” a spokeswoman said. Magid was attending the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament. During a chaotic first day, Nigel Farage and his Brexit party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the parliament. As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber , the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MEPs took their seats wearing yellow “bollocks to Brexit” T-shirts.
