West Ham hope to sign Eintracht Frankfurt’s Sébastien Haller after losing out to Valencia in the race to sign Maxi Gómez from Celta Vigo. Manuel Pellegrini desperately needs a striker after allowing Marko Arnautovic to join Shanghai SIPG for £22.4m this week and was hopeful of landing Gómez, only for the Uruguayan to choose Valencia. West Ham released Andy Carroll and sold Lucas Pérez to Alavés before deciding to cut their losses on Arnautovic, leaving them with Javier Hernández and Jordan Hugill as their only senior forwards. That has placed them under pressure to bring in reinforcements and they were prepared to break their transfer record to sign Gómez for €50m (£44.5m). Gómez’s snub came as a major disappointment to Pellegrini, who had targeted the 22-year-old since January, but West Ham have looked to move on quickly and have since stepped up their interest in Haller. They have held talks with Frankfurt over a potential £40m deal for the highly rated 25-year-old, who has been identified by Manchester United as a potential replacement for Romelu Lukaku if the Belgian striker moves to Internazionale. Haller’s representatives are waiting to see whether West Ham can agree a fee with the Bundesliga side. It also remains to be seen whether West Ham can convince Haller to move to the London Stadium. There is a feeling that the former France Under-21 international, who has scored 33 goals in 77 appearances since joining Frankfurt from Utrecht two years ago, could want to see whether he receives offers from clubs who have qualified for next season’s Champions League. West Ham have signed Pablo Fornals for Villarreal from £24m and brought in two goalkeepers, Roberto and David Martin, on frees.
