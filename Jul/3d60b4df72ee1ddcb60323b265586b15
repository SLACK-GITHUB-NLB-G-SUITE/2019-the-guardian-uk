England face the USA on Tuesday, with many hoping their team reaches the final on Sunday. A record-breaking 7.6 million people tuned in to BBC One in the UK to cheer on the Lionesses as they beat Norway in the quarter-finals. The Netherlands face Sweden on Wednesday. Guardian sports writer Sean Ingle wrote that this year’s World Cup has seen an explosion for women’s football. “When I took the manager’s job 18 months ago I never envisaged we’d be where we are today,” said Phil Neville. “It’s exploded, really. The World Cup has helped. But you don’t have an explosion without the quality on the field.” Do you think this World Cup has changed the way you, your friends or family view women’s football?
