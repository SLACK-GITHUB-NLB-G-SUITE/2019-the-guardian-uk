That this Scottish Open test is far removed from what the world’s leading golfers will encounter at the Open Championship next week was emphasised by ridiculously low scoring in East Lothian. “It is a nice piece of land, the design is not what we are used to seeing when we are talking links,” Henrik Stenson said diplomatically after his 65 at the Renaissance Club. The Swede’s six-under-par opening round was not sufficient for a place in the top 10 by the end of day one; level left you outside the top 100. Eight under, 63, leads the way, produced by Matt Kuchar, Romain Wattel, Nino Bertasio and Edoardo Molinari. With Royal Portrush and Open preparations in mind, competitors may hope for a sterner test over the upcoming 54 holes. Rory McIlroy raced to four under par inside six holes before settling for a 67. Justin Thomas signed for the same score. “If there is no wind and the course is soft, it’s going to be ripped apart,” McIlroy said. “It doesn’t have much defence. But I don’t mind that at all.” The 15th delivered holes‑in‑one for Kalle Samooja, of Finland, and Trevor Immelman, the 2008 Masters champion. Jamie Donaldson’s motivation to seal an Open berth stems from his Irish Open success at Portrush in 2012. The Welshman, a Ryder Cup player two years later, has slipped to 1,199 in the world rankings after enduring various injury problems. He opened here with a 64, with Andy Sullivan also among those just one from the lead. “I’m fit again now after a wrist operation,” Donaldson said. “It can still feel stiff of a morning if it’s cold but it’s as good as it’s ever going to feel. It’s what happens when you’re 43, I think we’re all the same, all the golfers still out here in their 40s. In some ways I feel lucky, there are guys having operations on their wrist in their 20s and 30s.”
