Everybody is allowed to be themselves, and everybody should be a little bit different as well. I’m not even going to try and make excuses. To blame bad luck is not an option for me. We've been here for four days and not seen any sun. We put men on the moon so why can't we have a reserve day? We’ve had issues in the past. We’ve had a few arguments on the field. But you don’t want to see a guy feeling that heat every time he goes out to play. Oh no, Eoin Morgan looked scared! That is a horror sign. Credit to Bangladesh. Their supporters came out – it felt like Dhaka or Chittagong. I’m definitely up there with the greats without a doubt. To the fans at home, all I can say is stay with us. Stranger things have happened before in sport. I played the way I know I can play, which was awesome. We don’t have any extra motivation because of redemption. I think that’s up to the individuals to tell those stories once the tournament is over. Plan A has gone. People are waiting for us to fail. They are not willing us on to win. We’ve played such good cricket, and 45 minutes of bad cricket puts you out of the tournament. It’s difficult to accept, it’s difficult to come to terms with. One of those things, eh? I will be apologising to Kane for the rest of my life. Photography by Tom Jenkins; editing by Jim Powell.
