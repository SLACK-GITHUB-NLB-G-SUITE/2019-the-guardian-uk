Heather Watson overcame a sticky start to claim the first British victory of this year’s Wimbledon against the American qualifier Caty McNally. Watson rallied to claim the first set on a tie-break before easing through the gears in the second to seal a 7-6, 6-2 victory. It marked the British player’s first singles victory in the main draw of a full WTA Tour event since last July in San Jose. Watson, who initially required a wild card to enter this year before withdrawals ultimately saw her sneak in on merit, was error prone in a 63-minute opening set which featured eight breaks of serve. Indeed, in the first game of the match Watson was comfortably broken by McNally – a 17-year-old on her grand slam debut – in a demonstration of the British No3’s rustiness. The 27-year-old Watson, who has reached the third round on three previous occasions, struggled to find her rhythm but showed her mettle at 3-3, scrapping to hold service, and again when facing two set points for 17 McNally at 5-6. Having survived those however, Watson took a commanding tie-break 7-3 before finding her serving groove and easing through the second set. • Full match report to follow …
