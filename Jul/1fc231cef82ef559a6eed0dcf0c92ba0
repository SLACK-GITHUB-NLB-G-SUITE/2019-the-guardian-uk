This is the look I wore to the opening of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the V&A in London at the beginning of the year. It’s a leather overcoat with buttons, styled as a dress, and a belt to cinch in my waist. It was winter, so I paired it with a black turtleneck for warmth. I don’t usually wear head-to-toe Dior. I am a very relaxed person and I tend to wear things that are very chilled out, such as a big leather jacket. I don’t really wear high heels. But wearing this, with the collar up, felt really sophisticated – it was like my alter ego. It made me feel like the person I want to be – I feel like that person has her act together. I had another outfit in mind for this event, but when I tried this one on, it looked so good and it fitted like a glove. My stylist was like: “Wow, this is a brand-new you!” I also saw my ex at the opening – I didn’t know he would be there but I felt like it was a good moment. This is the kind of outfit you want your ex to see you wearing. My sister Kate [Moss] doesn’t influence my wardrobe; we don’t live together and I am very lazy when it comes to dressing. When I wake up, it’s always a rush to find underwear and a bra, and then I just chuck something on. Sometimes my outfits look awful. But my style has evolved so much – even from just five years ago. I had zero confidence and I used to be a lot less daring. I live in Chelsea and I think people are a bit more reserved here. My friend held an event recently and I wore black trousers with a bandeau top – it wasn’t cropped, but you could see a bit of my midriff – with heels. We were at quite a posh restaurant and my friend said I looked great, but I could see older people staring. These days, I don’t really care. I love what I wear and I think it looks great.
