Rightwing, populist and nationalist leaders have welcomed Boris Johnson’s imminent arrival in Downing Street after Donald Trump praised the UK’s new prime minister as a “Britain Trump” who was “tough and smart” and would “do a great job”. In Italy, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right, anti-immigration League and deputy prime minister, wished Johnson “all the best”, adding: “The fact that on the left they are painting him as ‘more dangerous than the League’ makes me like him even more.” Buon lavoro a #BorisJohnson.Il fatto che da sinistra lo dipingano “più pericoloso della Lega” me lo rende ancor più simpatico😊@BorisJohnson pic.twitter.com/EjJUFDURv6 Brazil’s authoritarian far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who last week appeared not to know who Johnson was, added his congratulations, tweeting that he had been elected “on a commendable commitment to respect the wishes of the British people” and could “count on Brazil in the pursuit of free trade … and the defence of freedom and democracy”. - Parabéns @BorisJohnson, novo Primeiro-Ministro do Reino Unido, eleito com o compromisso louvável de respeitar os desígnios do povo britânico.

Pauline Hanson, the leader of the populist far-right One Nation movement in Australia, said she was “absolutely thrilled” that Johnson was to be Britain’s new prime minister, adding: “Hopefully the people of Britain can now have their voices heard” and “Bring on Brexit!” Absolutely thrilled @BorisJohnson is the new British Prime Minister. Hopefully now the people of Britain can have their voices heard. Bring on #Brexit! -PH In Germany, the leaders of the far-right, anti-immigration AfD’s parliamentary party, Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, issued an official statement congratulating Johnson on his appointment as the next head of government. “For this task and the coming challenges we wish him well! I am confident that he can succeed in quickly ending the impasse around Brexit that has lasted for years,” Weidel said. “The EU grandees are getting the British prime minister they deserve.” Gauland added: “Boris Johnson has won a formidable victory in the Tory ballot and received a strong mandate to implement Brexit decisively. I wish him luck in that!” Glückwunsch an Boris #Johnson. Die EU-Granden bekommen den GB-Premierminister, den sie verdienen. #Brexit #EU
