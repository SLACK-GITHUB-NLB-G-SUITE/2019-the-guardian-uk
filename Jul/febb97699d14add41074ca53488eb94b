Lady Gaga, Claire Foy and Sterling K Brown are among the film Academy’s diverse new list of members. This year’s list, made up of 842 industry names who will help to vote for the Oscars, is 50% female and 29% people of colour. If they accept then it would mean the Academy has doubled its members of colour in four years. The names come from across the globe, making up 59 countries. Other figures on the list include Jamie Bell, Claire Bloom, Gemma Chan, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, Jennifer Ehle, David Harewood, Tom Holland, Lennie James, Damian Lewis and Archie Panjabi. The list features 21 Oscar winners and 82 Oscar nominees. The total Academy membership will now include just over 10,000 people. It’s the latest step in a long-term strategy to improve the diversity of Academy members. In 2015, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started to trend when the acting and directing nominees included no one of color, a situation that repeated itself the following year. In 2016, the Academy president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, announced a diversity initiative to produce a more representative membership, doubling both women and people of color by 2020. This year’s ceremony saw Rami Malek become the first actor of Arab heritage to win best actor, Ruth E Carter become the first black person to win best costume design, Mahershala Ali become only the second black actor to win multiple acting Oscars and Hannah Beachler become the first black person to win best production design.
