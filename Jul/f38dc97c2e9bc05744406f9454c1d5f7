A dowager type, a minor character in a whimsical British film made before the Second World War (Once In A New Moon, since you ask), is quite emphatic about the perils of generosity to the lower classes: “Give them an inch and they will take an ell,” she proclaims in one scene. Today most of her audience would be much more familiar with the common usage, “Give them an inch and they will take a mile”. But, as proverbs go, that has always sounded a bit off. A mile is just too long a distance to work properly. And, sure enough, an “ell” is a forearm’s length to the elbow, measured by making the shape of a letter “L”. It is a nice reminder of what we lose when a phrase is modernised or superseded. Not only can a bit of sense be mislaid, but memory of the original form is soon obliterated. Recently we have exchanged “in the olden days” for the American idiom “back in the day” on a fairly wholesale basis. It probably just sounded a bit cooler to someone once and has now wiped out nearly all trace of its predecessor. It is not so much the change I mourn, but the forgetting. It is a sign of how adaptable language is, yet also a tiny symptom of human ability to unconsciously vaporise the past. Our parliamentarians are not much cop at passing key legislation, but they do get a lot of airtime and so have more impact on language than they should. In the past few years the word “substantive”, favoured by politicians, has taken over from the word “substantial” by those who want to make a point in the voice of authority. The words do not mean quite the same thing though. The first is closer to “big”, while the second is comparative. It is not an “ell” of a difference, but it is there and we should not forget. • Vanessa Thorpe is the Observer’s arts and media correspondent
