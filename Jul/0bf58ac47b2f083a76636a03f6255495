Maxwell why? 7) As England come out to bat, Jason Roy gets England off to a flyer ‚Ä¶ Jason boy 8) Jonny Bairstow is batting well but burns England‚Äôs review by questioning a correct lbw decision ‚Ä¶ Bairstow -_- 9) It means Roy cannot ask for a review when he is given out caught having not hit the ball ‚Ä¶ Umpire you smoking a spliff from zac? Da ain out 10) But Joe Root is on hand to steer England home ‚Ä¶ Root da you boy 11) Meaning Archer‚Äôs wish was granted ‚Ä¶ Want to go to lords
