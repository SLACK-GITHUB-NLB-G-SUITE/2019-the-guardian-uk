A Chinese city is cracking down on the practice of men rolling up their shirts and baring their bellies, as temperatures soar in parts of the country. The “Beijing bikini”, as it is sometimes known by expats, has been banned in the city of Jinan, in eastern China. The authorities there have released a notice banning the “uncivilised behaviour”, saying it was “seriously affecting the image of the city”.Violators of the new guidelines could face punishment, especially in densely populated areas such as parks, public squares, buses, scenic spots and business areas.Jinan’s authorities have also posted a long list of other banned behaviours, such as taking off shoes to air out feet, spitting, littering and queue-jumping. The sight of men with their shirts pulled up and their bellies on full display is common on the street, in parks and in tourist attractions across China during the summer.Some people on the social media site Weibo have supported the ban, saying the beloved practice of “bang ye,” or “exposing grandfathers”, was “too uncivilised”.But others have hit back on the side of the midriff-baring men. “He is only 60 years old. He just wants to wear a vest. What is his sin?” asked one person. Jinan is not alone in abhorring the exposed stomach, with the municipality of Tianjin posting a notice earlier this year saying people could be fined up to 200 yuan if they went shirtless in a public place.
