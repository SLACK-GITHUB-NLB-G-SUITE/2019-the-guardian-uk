Daniel Sturridge has been reunited with his stolen dog, two days after an emotional appeal from the former Liverpool striker on social media. The 29-year-old, without a club after being released by the Champions League winners this summer, posted a video on Instagram on Tuesday showing a broken glass door, which he said was where thieves broke in and took his dog as well as a number of bags from his Los Angeles home. The Pomeranian was returned to him after tweets from an account called “KILLAFLAME” circulated on social media with pictures of the dog, Lucci. A delighted Sturridge later posted a video saying: “I can’t believe it. I just want to say a big thank you to everyone on social media who supported us and raised awareness. I’m so thankful.” Thanks to everyone worldwide for the support. We’re so grateful for you all without you this wouldn’t have been possible!! @luccidapoochie is safe and sound!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thanks to everyone involved across LA. Special thanks to @kimberlychengtv for giving us the tip off that someone called into the show and said they have him. Her lead enabled myself and friends to go pick him up. 😎🙌🏾❤️ A post shared by  Daniel Sturridge - Dstudge (@danielsturridge) on Jul 10, 2019 at 10:15am PDT His LA home was reportedly broken into on Monday night and a visibly disturbed Sturridge posted CCTV footage of a group of men in black hoodies outside the property in West Hollywood along with a heartfelt plea to find Lucci, who also has his own Instagram account. The former England player, who often posts picture of Lucci on social media, offered up to £30,000 for the dog’s return.
