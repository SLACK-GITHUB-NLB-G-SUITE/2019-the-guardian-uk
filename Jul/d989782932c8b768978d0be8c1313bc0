Frozen peas are great, but I find peas in their pods transcendent. When I was 10, we moved to a small village where my parents gave me my own small patch in the garden as an allotment. Being the first vegetable I’d grown, my debut pea harvest was the best thing I’d ever eaten, and I’m sure one of the reasons I cook today. The peas were so fresh, I’d eat them, pods and all, straight off the vine. When we buy peas in their pods and throw the empty pods away, we waste about 50% of a vibrant, tasty product that’s rich in nutrients, not to mention the time it takes to pod them. If the pods are young, they are tender enough to eat whole; and if older and fibrous, they add a delicate, uplifting flavour to a soup or stock. They can also be juiced, or boiled, blended and passed through a sieve to make an incredibly vivid green sauce that’s exquisite as a drink, or stirred through a risotto or a soup. Fresh peas are similar to edamame, so I’ve prepared them here in a similar style. These make a great snack, with or without the juice. If you find that the pods are still a bit tough after you’ve blackened them, chop them into 10mm lengths to make them more manageable. 100g peas in pods per personTamari, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil and edible flowers, to decorate (optional) Remove the peas from the larger pods, but leave the smaller, more delicate ones whole. Juice the larger pods and put the liquid to one side; if you don’t have a juicer, blanch the pods in boiling water for a minute, strain, blend and pass through a sieve. Boil the remaining peas and pods for three minutes, then drain. Heat a thick-based griddle pan on a high heat. Tap the peas dry, lay them in the hot pan and leave to blacken slightly on both sides, then add a splash of tamari, stir and lift out. Serve the blackened peas in a bowl with the reserved juice, or even just as they are, and finish with a drizzle of good olive oil and a scattering of edible flowers, if you like.
