The US rapper A$AP Rocky has been arrested over an alleged aggravated assault in Stockholm. At the time of writing he has not been charged. Footage emerged of the rapper hurling a man to the ground as he and his entourage punched and kicked him. Other members of his entourage were filmed attacking another man. The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was later detained by police. Three others were arrested, two for aggravated assault and one for assault. Swedish authorities have until noon on Saturday to file charges. Mayers’ lawyer told CNN: “We are working hard with this and [are] confident that the prosecutor will take a decision in favour of my client when he gets the full picture.” Mayers posted a video on Instagram that showed him being followed by the two men who were later attacked – one appears to attack Mayers’ security guard by throwing a set of headphones at him. The guard is later heard telling a bystander: “He hit me with the headphones, he cut me on my head – I could really beat the shit out of him, I don’t even know him, he’s following us. Tell him to leave us alone.” Mayers says: “We don’t want to fight you … We don’t want no problem with these boys – they keep following us.” Mayers wrote in a caption on Instagram: “We don’t know these guys and we didn’t want trouble, they followed us for 4 blocks.” The Guardian has requested further comment from Mayers’ representatives. The rapper has twice topped the US album chart and released his most recent album, Testing, in 2018. He is scheduled to headline Wireless festival in London on Sunday.
