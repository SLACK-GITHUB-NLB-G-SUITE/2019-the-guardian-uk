We note with interest this week’s appointment of Ruby McGregor-Smith as chair of the new Office of Tackling Injustices (OfTI). We sincerely hope that one of OfTI’s top priorities will be to rectify the gross injustice experienced by 3.8 million women born in the 1950s who have lost up to six years of their state pensions, with little or no notice. We 1950s women have faced injustice throughout our lives. We started work before the protection of the equalities legislation of the 1970s and many of us were not allowed to join occupational pension schemes or take on mortgages without a male guarantor. Now the state pension is the sole source of income for 68% of women, compared with 44% of men. Taking away years of the pensions we have paid into all our lives is perhaps the worst injustice of all.
