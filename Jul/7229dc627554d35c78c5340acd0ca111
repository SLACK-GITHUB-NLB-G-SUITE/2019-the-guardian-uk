I was a Manchester probation officer in the team setting up community service by offenders in 1976-77. Richard Hills was keen to explore whether the Museum of Science and Industry might be able to provide placements. One of the men I was supervising knew about industrial weaving from his time in Manchester prison. Richard showed him a recently acquired Jacquard silk loom which was in a state of some disrepair. “I can fix that” said the offender. Richard took him on without hesitation and he worked off the rest of his 240 hours by demonstrating the now working loom to the public.
