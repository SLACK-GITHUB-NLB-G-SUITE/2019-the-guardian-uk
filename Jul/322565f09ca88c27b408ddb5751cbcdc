While covering the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2010, the Guardian photographer David Levene took time out to photograph one of the city’s best-loved tourist spots, St Mark’s Square – and decided to capture a different view of the adjoining Piazzetta. Using his tilt-shift Zörk lens, which is used to correct parallel lines in architectural photography, he played around with scale and perspective, focusing on a handful of tourists (and pigeons) at the centre of the picture, while blurring out the rest, creating a sense of intimacy. The effect is disorienting – the scene appears smaller, like a miniature town.
