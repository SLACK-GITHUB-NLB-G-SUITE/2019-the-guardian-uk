We bought bath and basin taps from Victorian Plumbing that had a 10-year guarantee. Both started to drip, and our plumber says the taps are fused inside, perhaps with limescale – meaning the whole tap needs to be replaced. Each time I write to Victorian Plumbing, it says it has sent replacement cartridges [the inside section of the tap]. Each time I tell it the whole tap must be replaced. KE, by email In the same week this arrived, another reader wrote to say Victorian Plumbing had not honoured the 10-year guarantee on her shower. It told her the cartridges only came with a one-year warranty. The company says it was working hard to put this right for both readers, and it would send out replacement items but adds: “Parts subject to normal wear and tear, like replaceable cartridges, aren’t part of the 10-year guarantee. Similarly, products that have suffered limescale damage aren’t covered, as the fault is from an external source and isn’t a product issue.” It says it is now looking at how its guarantee information can make clearer what is, and isn’t, covered.
