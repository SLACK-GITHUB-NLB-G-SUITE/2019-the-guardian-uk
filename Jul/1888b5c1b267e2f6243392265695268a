Tottenham will host the Women’s Super League champions and north London rivals Arsenal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 17 November. The full fixture list for the 2019-20 WSL season was announced on Wednesday morning with the derby the latest match to be moved to a stadium traditionally used for men’s football. Newly-promoted Manchester United, who start the campaign against neighbours Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, continue their tough start by hosting the Gunners a week later before a visit from Liverpool. Other fixtures could yet be relocated but it appears there will be no WSL and Premier League double-headers, with the north London derby in November taking place over an international weekend in the men’s game. Last season’s top two clash at Meadow Park on 27 October as Arsenal host Manchester City, with the return game pencilled in for 2 February at City’s Academy Stadium. The second Manchester derby of the season will take place on 29 March at Leigh Sports Village. If the title race goes to the last day of the season, two of the 2018-19 top three are at home – Arsenal hosting Everton and Chelsea facing Liverpool, while City are away at Brighton.
