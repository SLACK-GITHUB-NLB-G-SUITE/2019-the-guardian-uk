Former champion Rafael Nadal laid down a marker to his rivals for the Wimbledon title on Monday as he crushed Joao Sousa of Portugal 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals. The third-seeded Spaniard, who won here in 2008 and 2010, was close to his very best, belting 30 winners and making only 10 unforced errors as he booked a meeting with the winner of the all-American battle between Sam Querrey and Tennys Sandgren. “I think it was a good, solid match,” Nadal said. ”Even if the serve was not as good as two days ago, [there were] a lot of positive things out there, good forehands, backhands, changing the rhythm with the slice sometimes and some good volleys. [I’m] happy with the victory and [it is] good to be back in the quarter-finals. [I’m] happy to be where I am, the body is holding well‚” Fresh from winning his 12th French Open title last month, Nadal broke world No 69 Sousa early and that was effectively that. The Portuguese, who beat Britain’s Dan Evans in five sets in the previous round, had no answer to the power and sheer belligerence of Nadal, who wrapped things up in one hour and 45 minutes. Twelve months ago, Nadal was edged out by the eventual champion, Novak Djokovic, in the semi-finals. This year, having dropped just one set, his confidence is high. “Last year I think in the semi-final I played a great match and was very close to winning another title,” he said. “But that was last year, I can’t compare, but I am happy to be in the quarter-finals, with a lot of positive feelings.”
