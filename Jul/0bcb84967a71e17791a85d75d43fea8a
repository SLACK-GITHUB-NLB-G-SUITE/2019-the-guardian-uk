David Thouless’s obituary (13 July) mentions his father, Robert, but fails to mention the latter’s most notable publication, which contains one of the most important contributions of the 20th century to the public good: Straight and Crooked Thinking. Its contents are best summed up by the jacket blurb: “This practical book by an eminent psychologist tells you how to think clearly and avoid muddled reasoning. It exposes many dishonest tricks that are often used in argument, drawing the examples from controversial subjects which are frequently discussed today.” It was first published in 1930 (revised and enlarged edition in 1953), and my father gave me my copy in the early 1960s. Happily, it’s still available and is as relevant today as it ever was; if only a copy could be put into the hands of every teenager in the land.
