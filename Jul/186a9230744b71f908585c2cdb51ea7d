The item on Lodge Moor (Students reveal stories from Britain’s largest prisoner of war camp, 4 July) reminded me of an incident early in my career as a German teacher. I was travelling to Vienna along the Danube by scooter in 1965 when a heavy shower reduced the surface to mud. We took shelter in a café with the men repairing the road and, chatting with them, I mentioned we were from Sheffield. One man beamed and told us he had spent part of the war at Lodge Moor and how much he liked it there; clearly far preferable to fighting on the eastern front!Veronica HardstaffSheffield • Should the long-running London show Crap Tory Government come with warnings about backstabbing, dangerous lying and persistent threat to vulnerable audience members (A warning too far?
