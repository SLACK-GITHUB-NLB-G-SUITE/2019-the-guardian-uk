The New Zealand city of Dunedin has sought to look on the bright side after losing its claim to have the world’s steepest street to a town in Wales, with its mayor saying: “The street certainly hasn’t got any less steep as a result of the decision.” This week, Guinness World Records officially stripped Dunedin’s Baldwin Street of the title and instead awarded it to Harlech in Wales. Its street, Ffordd Pen Llech, has a gradient of 37.45% at its steepest point – 2.5% steeper than Baldwin Street. Mayor Dave Cull took the blow on the chin, saying “Dunedin has a wonderful range of visitor attractions and we think plenty of people will still visit Baldwin Street as part of their Dunedin experience.” He suggested changing the street’s signage from “world’s steepest street” to “southern hemisphere’s steepest street”, something the council is taking advice on. Baldwin Street has long been a drawcard for tourists and daredevils alike. It has played host to brave drift triking, pogoers, electric scooter riders and rubbish bin rollers. Residents of the street do not seem to be fazed about their loss of status, and some have even welcomed the decision. “[Tourists] can be a bit unruly at times,” Ray Short, who has lived on the street for 53 years, told the Otago Daily Times. “They’ll walk right up to your garage and they’ll walk right up to your windows and take photos. It can all be a bit unnerving at times.’’ The street’s title was initially flagged in 1985 when a Dunedin journalist asked the council what the city’s steepest street was. A story was then broadcast that evening announcing the news to the world and so began a two-year correspondence with Guinness to get Baldwin Street officially recognised. That journalist, now national broadcaster Jim Mora, has said that he was disappointed by the latest decision but would still be “sporting” about it.
