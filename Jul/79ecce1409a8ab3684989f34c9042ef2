West Ham have announced the signing of Sébastien Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt for a club-record fee that it is understood could rise to €50m (£45m). The 25-year-old striker, who scored 20 goals in 41 appearances last season and is a former France Under-21 international who came through the ranks at Auxerre, has signed an initial five-year deal. His fee eclipses the £33.5m West Ham paid for Felipe Anderson last year. “West Ham are delighted to announce the arrival of prolific French striker Sébastien Haller, the club’s new record signing,” a statement said. “The highly sought-after forward, who turned 25 in June, joins the Hammers on a five-year deal with an option of a further 12 months for an undisclosed fee from Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt. “The deal for Haller means the Hammers have broken their transfer record for a third time in a little over a year following the captures of Issa Diop and Felipe Anderson.” Premier League ain't ready 👊All the best, @HallerSeb 🦅 pic.twitter.com/AJAbKK0bO8 Haller joins the Spain midfielder Pablo Fornals and the goalkeeping duo Roberto and David Martin in signing for West Ham this summer.
