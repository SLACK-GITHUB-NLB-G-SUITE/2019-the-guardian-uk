Yulia Putintseva claimed a second straight victory over Naomi Osaka to dump the second seed and double grand slam winner out of Wimbledon on the opening day. Osaka’s last match before arriving at the All England Club was a straight-sets loss to Putintseva at the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham and again the Kazakh proved too consistent. Osaka, the current US and Australian Open champion, led by an early break but could not hold onto her advantage and Putintseva celebrated a 7-6 (4) 6-2 victory and one of the biggest victories of her career. Meanwhile, French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova was knocked out in a 6-4, 6-4 defeat by Madison Brengle of the United States. The 16th-seeded Brengle broke Vondrousova seven times, taking advantage of 30 unforced errors from the Czech player. Vondrousova reached her first Grand Slam final at Roland Garros, losing in straight sets to Ash Barty. She reached the semifinals at this year’s Australian Open. Vondrousova also lost in the first round at Wimbledon in 2017 and 2018.
