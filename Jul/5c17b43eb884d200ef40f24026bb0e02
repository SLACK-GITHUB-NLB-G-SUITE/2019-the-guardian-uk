Aston Villa have signed Tyrone Mings on a permanent basis in a deal that could be worth £26.5m to Bournemouth. After weeks of talks, Villa have agreed to pay an initial fee of around £20m for the 26-year-old defender, who impressed after joining on loan in January. Mings was hugely influential in helping Dean Smith’s side to achieve promotion to the Premier League. “We’re really pleased to have Tyrone back at Aston Villa on a permanent basis,” Smith told the club’s website. “I think everybody could see the connection that he made with the club as a whole. He will be an integral part of the squad for the new season and I look forward to working with him and helping to further develop his game.” Mings has not undergone a formal medical at Villa, which has sped up the process of the transfer. The club is understood to be happy with the centre-back’s physical condition after spending much of the past six months at the club, and he will now join up with Aston Villa on their pre-season US tour. The move for Mings, who made 10 Premier League starts for Bournemouth, takes Villa’s summer spending beyond £50m after the club acquired Anwar El Ghazi, Matt Targett, Kortney Hause, Jota and the striker Wesley Moraes. His arrival is a major boost to Smith and the chief executive, Christian Purslow, who continues to rebuild the squad. Villa remain keen on the Bristol City defender Adam Webster, the Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and the winger Saïd Benrahma, whom Smith signed for £1.5m at Brentford last summer. Bournemouth have signed the Luton right-back Jack Stacey in a £4m deal, with Eddie Howe bolstered his defence further following the £13m arrival of Lloyd Kelly from Bristol City.
