The attorney Michael Avenatti said on Monday he now represents three alleged victims of singer R Kelly, three whistleblowers who have information about the case and three parents of alleged victims. Kelly, 52, was arrested last week on a 13-count indictment that includes sex crimes and obstruction of justice. A federal indictment was also unsealed in New York that charges him with racketeering and sex-related crimes. A federal court hearing due for Monday was pushed back and will instead be held on Tuesday, when the singer was expected to be arraigned. Federal judges were supposed to meet in Chicago to figure how to proceed in the case. According to a judge’s order they will now discuss the details on Tuesday afternoon. Kelly remains in federal custody. Federal prosecutors want him to stay there, arguing he is dangerous and a flight risk. His attorney denies the allegations. He is expected in court on Tuesday. At a press conference in Chicago on Monday, Avenatti said that at least one of the whistleblowers made copies of the tapes that Avenatti ultimately turned over to the Cook county state’s attorney, Kim Foxx. The celebrity lawyer also said Kelly paid a 14-year-old girl he had sex with and her family $2m to buy their silence and relocate them out of the Chicago area. Avenatti, who formerly represented the adult film star and director Stormy Daniels in her claim to have had an affair with Donald Trump, faces mounting legal problems himself. He was charged in March with trying to extort up to $25m from Nike by threatening to go public with claims that the sportswear company was facilitating improper payouts to promising young athletes and their families.
