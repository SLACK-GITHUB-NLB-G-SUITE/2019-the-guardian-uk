Fourteen crew on board a Russian defence ministry submersible have been killed after a fire broke out, the ministry was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. The deep-sea research vessel was carrying out a military survey in Russian territorial waters, it said. The incident took place on Monday and the fire has been extinguished. The submersible is now at the Russian northern fleetâ€™s base in Severomorsk on the Barents Sea, and an investigation has been launched to establish the cause, Interfax, RIA and Tass quoted the ministry as saying. In August 2000 the Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk sank to the floor of the Barents Sea after two explosions in its bow, killing all 118 men onboard.
