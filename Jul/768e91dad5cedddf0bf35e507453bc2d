Chinese Super League clubs Beijing Guoan, Jiangsu Suning and Shanghai Shenhua have no end of ambition. They’re banking on the fact that Gareth Bale’s own horizons have run out. Though to be fair, the offers look pretty fine to us, including benefits such as a luxury pad, lucrative image rights, regular first-class flights back home, and a manager that doesn’t think he’s a complete waste of space. We say go for it. Bale’s departure would allow Real to sign Paul Pogba. What Manchester United then do with their money is a moot point. Spend it on £90m Juventus striker Paulo Dybala, perhaps. Or maybe they’ll go for Christian Eriksen, whose frequent come-and-get-me pleas to nobody in particular, anyone, just anyone, have been met on the continent with thundering indifference. Atlético Madrid were thinking about it, but turns out they’re more interested in James Rodríguez instead. Atletico have already prised Kieran Trippier away from Spurs, of course. And Mauricio Pochettino seems more than happy to let Danny Rose leave for Juventus. That’ll be both his first-choice full-backs gone. It’s bold. What’s he up to? At least Toby Alderweireld won’t be going anywhere, despite interest from Roma. Better news for Spurs, active again in the transfer market after Daniel Levy spent 18 months kicking back with his feet on the desk: they’ll complete the signings this week of Fulham hot-prospect Ryan Sessegnon and Real Betis midfielder Giovani lo Celso. These deals have been in the pipeline for a while, much like most of the rumours in today’s Mill. Ah! Here we go. Box-fresh newness! Aston Villa, desperate to regain their Victorian-era dominance of English football, intend to put 120 years of hurt behind them by signing Trézéguet, the winger who flattered to deceive for Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations. They’ve offered Kasimpasa of Turkey £8m, and it’s on, folks, it’s on. Now, enough of this nonsense. Go out and play. The weather’s lovely.
