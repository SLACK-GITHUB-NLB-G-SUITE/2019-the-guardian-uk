Your article about spectra (Does thinking about things ‘on a spectrum’ make us more enlightened?, 30 July) claims the word was “coined by Isaac Newton in 1672 to describe refractions of light”. In fact, the first recorded use in English is in 1622 to refer to a phantom or apparition. Newton was the first to employ it to describe the range of refracted light; however, that does not represent a coinage, rather, a novel usage. I am aware that this type of pedantry probably pinpoints my location on the spectrum quite accurately.
