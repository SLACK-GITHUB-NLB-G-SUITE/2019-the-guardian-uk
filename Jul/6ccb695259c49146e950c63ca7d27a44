AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield is all for donating his brain to post-mortem concussion research after last month the disease CTE was found in the donated brains from two rugby league players. The degenerative condition is also linked to repeated concussions in American sports. In the wake of the findings, several AFL players said last week they would think about donating their brains for research. “Absolutely – when it comes to organ donation, whether it’s your brain or functioning organs ... you can’t take them with you when you’re gone,” Dangerfield said. “I’d be all for that.” There is also ongoing speculation about class actions against the AFL and NRL on behalf of players who have suffered from concussion. The Geelong star noted that some of the money from match review fines goes to concussion research. Dangerfield backs what the game is doing in terms of concussion, but added there was still plenty to learn about the issue. “It’s a difficult one, because there’s only so much research that’s gone into it and there is still so much that’s unknown,” he said. “We have to make sure as a code, as a players’ association, as clubs, that we’re providing the ultimate care for our players and making sure we take a no-risk approach. I’m confident the clubs, AFL and AFLPA are doing [that].”
