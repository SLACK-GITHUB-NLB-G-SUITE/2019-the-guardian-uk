I remember Julie Welch’s name as I was a football fan from 1969-76 (It was lonely being a female football fanatic. Not any more, Journal, 6 July). However, I never felt lonely. From the age of about 12 to 18, I went to over 300 Birmingham City matches, and don’t have any memories of it being unusual as a young girl: I was just one of up to 30,000 other fans. For the first few years I stood at the Railway End with my mum and a friend of hers. But once they succumbed to the comfort of the seats I stayed on the terraces. Here I was thoroughly wrapped up in the game, analysing every move, often on my own, or with pals from college. I can only remember one occasion I ever felt in danger, when our supporters’ coach was stoned by Derby fans at an away game. Football dominated many years of my young life, my gender being irrelevant to everyone I knew. I now have absolutely no interest in football but look back fondly on my days of adoring each and every one of the Birmingham City team. Everyone can choose whether to play or watch or analyse, or not. Julie, thanks for memories.Toni ClarkKiltarlity, Highland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
