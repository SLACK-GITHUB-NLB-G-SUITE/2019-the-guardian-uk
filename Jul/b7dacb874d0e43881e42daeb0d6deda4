The late Sam King, a co-founder of Windrush Foundation, would not have agreed with Floella Benjamin’s suggestion that Waterloo station is an appropriate site for a Windrush monument (Letters, 26 June). Neither do I, who have nurtured and publicised the “Windrush phenomenon” since 1995. Baroness Benjamin did not consult with me or any other director of Windrush Foundation. The Empire Windrush passengers arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948, and Sam King was one of them. Some passengers travelled through Fenchurch Street (not Waterloo station), and 236 men went to Clapham South deep-level (air raid) shelter, where they found temporary accommodation. Within a few days, the mayor of Lambeth held a reception for them, and this was the only one they received. The local member of parliament spoke up for them. The passengers visited the local employment exchange in Brixton and soon found work, and set up home in the area. Brixton was the first “Windrush community” in 1948 and it is still going strong today. Windrush Square, in the centre of Brixton, commemorates and celebrates the contributions of the Windrush passengers, and it is there that the monument should be installed. They are the ones who laid the foundation for those of us who arrived later. Having the monument in Windrush Square would be the right “symbolic link to our past as we celebrate our future”, to quote Baroness Benjamin’s words. This would materialise Sam King’s dreams and legacy.Arthur TorringtonDirector, Windrush Foundation
