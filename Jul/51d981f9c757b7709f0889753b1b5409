Wolverhampton Wanderers are set to complete the signing of the Milan forward Patrick Cutrone in a deal that could rise to £20m. An agreement has been reached for the Italian’s £16.2m transfer from San Siro, with potential add-ons worth up to £3.8m. Cutrone’s contract is likely to be until 2024 at Molineux, where hopes are high for the club to push on from last season’s seventh-place finish in the Premier League. He is set to undergo a medical later this week. The 21-year-old broke into Milan’s first-team squad in 2017 and received his first international call-up a year later, making his solitary Italy appearance to date in the 2-0 defeat to Argentina.
