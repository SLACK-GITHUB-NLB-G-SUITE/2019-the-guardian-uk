In 1982, following a threat to the future of fewer than 4,000 Falkland Islanders, all service personnel were recalled to duty and all leave cancelled. Could all MPs please explain to the more than 66 million people of the UK why they think it is appropriate for them to be away from their place of duty for eight weeks during a time when the UK faces a fundamental change to its way of life and future.Alison MandevilleTruro, Cornwall • Mariam Alexander’s article (Opinion, 22 July) was most welcome. Having been treated on three occasions with ECT for severe depression I can testify that for me it has been a highly effective treatment with minimal side-effects. I just wish that more psychiatrists would be as willing to prescribe it as Dr Alexander.Ian ArnottPeterborough • One reason Dr Carhart may hear the dialogue on older films better (Letters, 24 July) is the absence of loud intrusive backing music. Some music is good to set the emotional scene – tense, scary, exciting, etc – but recently this genre has been hugely overused. More music means less work for the actors, and any fluffed lines are masked. I’m still not sure why every news channel needs dramatic music though. Can’t viewers decide for themselves if the news is exciting or not?Dr Hillary ShawNewport, Shropshire • If you’re bothered about being called granny (Letters, 25 July), move to Liverpool. We are all “Queen” here no matter what our age.Joyce BlackledgeFormby, Merseyside • Madam, Miss, Dear, Love, Darling, Sweetheart. The manner in which I am addressed is changing as I age.
