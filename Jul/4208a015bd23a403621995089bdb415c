US goal celebrations were a talking point yet again during Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final against England. After Alex Morgan scored USA’s second goal of the game, she raised her fingers to her lips, miming a sip of tea.

Piers Morgan called it “a declaration of war”, while Hillary Clinton said “congrats to the USWNT for earning that tea”. Congrats to the #USWNT for earning that tea. On to the final! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nI8HoMjN1D Morgan herself was asked about the celebration after the game but would not give specifics. “[Megan Rapinoe] has so many celebrations – no one asks her, but I have one and everyone wants to know,” she said with a laugh. The US had already attracted criticism for what some perceived as overcelebration when they beat Thailand 13-0. In that game, the US were still furiously celebrating long after the game had been sealed. In their following game, Carli Lloyd celebrated one of her goals with a polite “golf clap”. The US won the game 2-1 to send them to the World Cup final.
