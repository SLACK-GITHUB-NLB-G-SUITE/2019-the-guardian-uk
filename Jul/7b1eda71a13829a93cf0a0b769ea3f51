“By absolutely no power invested in me...” Surveys show more and more couples are choosing to put their own spin on the tradition of marriage by asking a friend or family member to conduct a ceremony personalised for them. While these ceremonies have no legal significance (and come after or before a legal, civil ceremony), they can carry a great deal of meaning for the couple and celebrant. We’d like to hear from people who were married by a loved one. Tell us why you chose this kind of ceremony, what significance it had for you, and why you chose the person you did to conduct it. You can get in touch by filling out the form below. We’ll publish a selection of our favourite contributions as part of our coverage. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
