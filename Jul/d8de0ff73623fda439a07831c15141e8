Citizens of Trieste are planning a protest on Saturday to claim their “right to nap in a hammock” in the northern Italian city’s popular seafront pine forest area, Barcola, after an Austrian tourist was fined €300 for sleeping in one. The man, 52, hung a hammock between two trees along the promenade that runs between the forest and seafront on Thursday afternoon. But his slumber was interrupted by police following complaints from passersby. To express their solidarity with the visitor and indignation over the hefty penalty, a group calling itself the Free Hammock Collective is calling on people to hang their hammocks in Barcola between 6pm and 7pm on Saturday as part of a flashmob. In a note sent to local newspapers, the group said the aim of the protest was to “claim the right to nap in Barcola lulled by the rocking of a hammock”. The group is galvanising support on social media via the hashtags #amachelibere (free hammocks) and #disobbedienzacivile (civil disobedience). About 50 people have so far pledged their participation. “We hope that at least 100 disobedient civilians will be present in hammocks,” the organisers said. Daniela Gianello, a press officer for the local police, said the man had broken a law against attaching objects to trees. “The law is not for decorum but for the protection of public green spaces,” she said. “The man hung his hammock over part of the footpath, so, in part, it was also an obstruction for pedestrians.” The former Trieste mayor Roberto Cosolini ridiculed authorities over the episode. “Fortunately, my passion for Mexico and its hammocks led me to assemble a comfortable Yucatan hammock at home,” he wrote on Facebook. “So I can relax with a cerveza or daiquiri without taking any risks. Joking aside, maybe you can start by explaining, especially to the foreign tourists in a welcoming city, what the rule is and invite them to respect it.”
