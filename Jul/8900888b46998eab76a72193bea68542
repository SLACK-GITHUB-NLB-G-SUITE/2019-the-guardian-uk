It’s not just a new crop of festivals that are cleaning up (Secret garden parties, G2, 26 July). Some of these “boutique” festivals have been around a long time (well before “boutique” became the way to describe them). Stainsby Festival has just celebrated its 51st event with no years out. It’s a family-friendly, volunteer-run event that works on a not-for-profit basis with very affordable tickets. While our lineup wouldn’t present a bandwidth problem to Spotify, a number of alumni from folk and world music royalty have passed through its tent flaps over the years, from Steeleye Span and Barbara Dixon to hip-hop folk performers like Dizraeli and the Small Gods. Rumours that Bob Dylan once appeared incognito in the early years seem, however, to be unreliable (but we’re not denying it – this is the age of post-truth after all). So, we’re glad to see that newer festivals are beginning to catch on to this way of working. Long may they run.Tony TraffordChair of trustees, Stainsby Festival • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
