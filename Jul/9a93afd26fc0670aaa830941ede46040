Cannondale TopstonePrice £2,100, evanscycles.com Frame carbon Gears 22-speed Shimano 105 Brakes hydraulic disc The term ‘gravel’ bike is a recent import from America. I think ‘trail’ would be more accurate, but it doesn’t sound so of-the-moment. We used to call them cross-bikes or even x-bikes. But, essentially, they are all the same thing. They are road bikes with off-road capabilities. Wheels are bigger, frames are more durable, brakes are beefed up and some have suspension. The upshot of all this is that you get a go-anywhere bike that lets you ride fast on smooth tarmac before heading confidently into terrain that most bikes would soon be rattled to pieces on. Cannondale has come a long way since it first got down to business in 1971 in Connecticut in a loft above an old pickle factory. Its initial product was a bike trailer known as the ‘Bugger’. The first bike, a touring model, wasn’t produced until 1983, but since then it’s gone on to create bikes that have won the world’s greatest races – including the Giro and Vuelta. The new Topstone features a lightweight suspension system that lets you ride harder when the riding gets hard. It’s strong, comfortable and will cope with anything.
