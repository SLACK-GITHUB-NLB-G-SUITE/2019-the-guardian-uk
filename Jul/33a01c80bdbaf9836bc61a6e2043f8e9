Steve Bruce has resigned as Sheffield Wednesday manager, clearing one of the hurdles before being able to take charge of Newcastle United. The 58-year-old is believed to be close to replacing Rafael Benítez at the Tyneside club and has now left Wednesday, but the two clubs have yet to agree a compensation package. Bruce had been in place at Hillsborough since January, guiding the Owls to 12th in the Championship in his half season in charge. The former Manchester United captain is a boyhood Newcastle supporter, having grown up in the area. If he does take over from Benítez Newcastle will be the 10th club of a 21-year managerial career. Joselu, however, will not be at his disposal next season after the striker left for La Liga’s Alavés in a deal worth around £2.5m. A Newcastle statement said: “Joselu has completed a permanent move to La Liga side Deportivo Alavés. The 29-year-old forward has joined the Spanish side for an undisclosed fee, bringing his two-year stay at St James’ Park to an end. The club wishes Joselu well for the future.” The player tweeted: “Dear Newcastle United Fans, the time has come to say goodbye. I just can say THANK YOU. Incredible Stadium, city, Club and people. Wish you all the best for the upcoming season.” Joselu scored only three times in 20 appearances last season, though his departure leaves Dwight Gayle and Yoshinori Muto as the club’s only frontline strikers. This month Ayoze Pérez was sold to Leicester for £30m while Mohamed Diamé left on a free. Newcastle are yet to sign anyone in the current transfer window.
