The deadly wildfires that hit California in 2018 are to become the subject of a new film, it has been announced. According to the Hollywood Reporter, A Private War’s Matthew Heineman will write and direct a film set against the backdrop of the Camp Fire, named for its point of origin on Camp Creek Road in Butte County, which killed 85 people and destroyed the small town of Paradise. Heineman’s film will focus on the real-life story of Heather Roebuck, who was forced to flee the town’s Feather River hospital minutes after giving birth. Roebuck chronicled her ordeal in a Facebook post, in which she explained she was unable to walk after her operation, was separated from her baby and that the ambulance she was initially placed in almost immediately caught fire. Heineman said in a statement: “Heather’s journey of inner strength in the face of unparalleled and unexpected adversity is one of the most exciting and visceral stories that I’ve ever encountered.”
