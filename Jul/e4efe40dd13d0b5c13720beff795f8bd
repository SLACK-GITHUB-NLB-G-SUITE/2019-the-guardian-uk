Manchester United will make their Women’s Super League debut against Manchester City when the season begins in September. Casey Stoney’s side won the Championship title by nine points in their first campaign and will make their maiden top-flight appearance at City, who finished runners-up and won the Women’s FA Cup and Continental League Cup last season. Arsenal, the WSL champions, are at home against the FA Cup finalists West Ham, while the Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea start at home against the WSL newcomers Tottenham. The opening round will be played on 7-8 September. In other opening-weekend games, Birmingham host Everton, Bristol City are at home against Brighton and Reading go to Liverpool. “It’s a very exciting time for women’s football with the country currently swept up in the Women’s World Cup and the Lionesses performing brilliantly,” said Kelly Simmons, director of the women’s professional game. “We’re looking forward to this increased interest carrying over into our domestic game next season and beyond. “Opening weekend is packed full of great fixtures that are sure to set the tone for what promises to be the biggest and most exciting domestic season yet and we look forward to releasing the full fixture list next week.”
