Supermarket Sweep is to return, with Rylan Clark-Neal presenting the game show previously hosted by Dale Winton. Clark-Neal appeared to confirm he would host a rebooted version on ITV2 with a tweet saying: “Been waiting a while to say this but it’s finally time to GO WILD IN THE AISLES ONCE AGAIN! Supermarket Sweep is back, and I can’t wait for you to CHECK IT OUT. See you soon on itv2 #SupermarketSweep” He will take over presenting duties from Winton, who died last year aged 62. Meanwhile, it was announced Clark-Neal will present You Are What You Wear, a new makeover series and collaboration between BBC One and MultiStory Media, which is a subsidiary of ITV Studios. In the series, four customers will visit a department store to be given assistance by personal shoppers. Clark-Neal, who rose to prominence on the X Factor, went on to host Celebrity Big Brother’s Bit on the Side and will join Zoë Ball later this year to co-host Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two.
