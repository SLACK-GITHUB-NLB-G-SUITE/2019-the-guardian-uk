Jason Roy looks set to be part of England’s Ashes campaign after receiving a first Test call-up for the match against Ireland next week. The opener, a key part of England’s World Cup triumph, was named in the 13-man party for the four-day, one-off Test at Lord’s on Wednesday, one that includes another new face in Somerset’s Lewis Gregory. There is also a place for Jimmy Anderson despite concerns over the bowler’s fitness as well as a return from injury for Warwickshire’s Olly Stone. But it is Roy’s inclusion that catches the eye. The 28-year-old had a sensational World Cup, scoring 443 runs as England went onto claim a first ever 50-over trophy in the most remarkable of circumstances. Roy’s haul included a highest score of 153 and an average of 63.28. He also hit 12 sixes and 51 fours and, ultimately, it felt as if his inclusion in the Test squad was a formality. The Surrey batsman will be in the team that lines-up against Ireland and should also feature when battle commences against Australia at Edgbaston on 1 August. Some of England’s other World Cup heroes are also included in the squad, including Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Chris Woakes. Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes have been rested, however, while Mark Wood is expected to be out of action for four to six weeks following the injury he sustained in Sunday’s final victory over New Zealand.
