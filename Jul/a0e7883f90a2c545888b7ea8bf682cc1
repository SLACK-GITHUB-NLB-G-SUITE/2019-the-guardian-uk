I imagine that the Bewdley rock presented to Adrian Chiles’s dad (G2, 11 July) was from Teddy Gray’s sweetshop in Bewdley. Established in Dudley in 1826, it still produces and sells its own confectionery, Bewdley being one of its outlets. It’s well worth a visit, as is Bewdley itself, a beautiful Georgian town on the banks of the Severn.Phil RhodenLow Habberley, Worcestershire • Good to be reminded that the line “Buy a saw in ’74” in response to “Plant a tree in ’73” in I’m Sorry I’ll Read That Again was articulated by John Cleese (Letters, 11 July). But somebody, presumably a comedy writer of some sort, must have written it. Who could that have been, I wonder?Chris MillerLondon • I have an Izal toilet roll (Letters, 12 July), made in Sheffield, each sheet printed with a Heath Robinson drawing. My favourite is “Device for disinfecting a broody hen”. By the way, I made a Radio 4 musical documentary about the Izal toilet roll a few years ago, called Now Wash Your Hands.Sally GoldsmithSheffield • I remember Izal. It carried little verses, of which I recall “Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was full of germs. She put it in an Izal bath, and now it’s full of perms.”Helen Davoll (aged 94)Great Bookham, Surrey • No mention of John Belushi (Here’s to the last of the hellraisers, G2, 12 July)? Surely a top 10 hellraiser?Mark AustinHorsmonden, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
