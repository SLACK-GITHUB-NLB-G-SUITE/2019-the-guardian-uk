The body of Florijana Ismaili was recovered in Lake Como on Tuesday, three days after the Switzerland international was involved in a swimming accident. The 24-year-old forward went missing on Saturday at the lake in northern Italy. She did not surface after jumping from a boat she had rented with a friend. The captain of the Young Boys club in Bern played 33 times for Switzerland. “We are dismayed, shocked and very, very much in pain,” the Swiss football federation said in a statement, offering “sincere condolences” to Ismaili’s family and friends. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, who is Swiss-Italian, described Ismaili’s death as “an extremely sad moment for all the football community, particularly at a time when we gather at the Women’s World Cup.” “Both on mine and Fifa’s behalf, I would like to express the most heartfelt condolences to Florijana’s family and friends, to the Swiss federation and to BSC Young Boys.” Before the news was confirmed, Young Boys had posted on its Twitter account a video of support from the Swiss champions men’s squad in which the players formed the shape of a heart.
