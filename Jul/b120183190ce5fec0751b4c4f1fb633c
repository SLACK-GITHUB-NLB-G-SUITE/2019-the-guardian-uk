Europe is full of nooks and crannies, places that most visitors haven’t come across and that don’t attract floods of comments on TripAdvisor. Your tip could be about a village, a town, a nature reserve, a stretch of coast, even a national park with a low profile. We would love to hear about your discoveries. Send tips from all parts of Europe (but not the UK this time), including transport details, exact locations and websites if possible. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 23 July 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here. Read the terms and conditions
