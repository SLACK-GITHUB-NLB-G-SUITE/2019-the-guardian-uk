Hermosa, a dual Classic winner earlier in the season, is the major obstacle standing in Frankie Dettori’s way as he aims to win four consecutive Group One races in Britain for the first time in his career on Thursday afternoon, riding Mehdaayih. Hermosa took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket and followed up in the Irish equivalent before finishing only second in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. That was her third race in 41 days, however, and she has had a break since, while as a daughter of Galileo she is likely to find Thursday’s step up to 10 furlongs for the Nassau Stakes in her favour. Dettori’s partner, by contrast, is dropping back in trip having won a Group Two at a mile and a half last time.

Goodwood 1.50 Little went right for Sinjaari when he was sent off as the second-favourite for the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot last time, as he raced wide and alone from a high draw through the first half-mile and then had nothing left to give in the straight. His progressive form to that point reads well in the context of today’s race and the drop back to 10 furlongs could be in his favour too. The overall strength of the Ascot form was also underlined here on Wednesday when Sir Ron Priestley, who finished 18th, recorded his second win since. Goodwood 2.25 There is little to choose between Threat and Guildsman on their form behind Arizona in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot, where they were second and third respectively. Guildsman, though, has disappointed since when only fourth in the July Stakes and Richard Hannon’s colt looks to have the greater scope to progress. Goodwood 3.00 The King George V form from Ascot crops up again as Constantinople, the runner-up at the Royal meeting, switches back to Group Three company in a race that has been won by a series of future stars in recent years including Cross Counter, Crystal Ocean, Ulysses and Highland Reel. Constantinople has some way to go to match them but is on the right path and overcame a difficult draw at Ascot to beat all bar his better-drawn stable companion, South Pacific. Spanish Mission, the Bahrain Trophy winner, will be a tough opponent but Constantinople could well develop into a leading contender for next month’s St Leger.
