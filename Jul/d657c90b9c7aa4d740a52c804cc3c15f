Frankie Dettori rode his 10th Group One winner in the space of two months as Stradivarius quickened past Cross Counter and Dee Ex Bee to win the Goodwood Cup on Tuesday, the feature race on day one of Glorious Goodwood. Stradivarius, the winner of the race for the last two seasons, set off as the odds-on favourite at 4-5 and Dettori tracked Cross Counter, the 3-1 second-choice, until inside the final quarter mile. Cross Counter struck for home with just over a furlong to run but Dettori had the move covered and Stradivarius took his measure before holding off the late rally of Dee Ex Bee. Stradivarius is now three-quarters of the way towards winning the Stayers’ Million for the second year running, and quoted at just 2-5 to win the final leg, the Lonsdale Stakes at York next month, to secure the £1m bonus. Dettori, meanwhile, is on course to enjoy the best season of his career at the highest level, by surpassing his haul of 16 Group One or Grade One races in 2001.
