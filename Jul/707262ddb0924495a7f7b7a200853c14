This week, campaigners were worried that Theresa May’s cherished plans to increase “sin taxes” on tobacco companies and milkshakes would not survive the end of her premiership. Boris Johnson, perhaps a man particularly reluctant to contemplate negative consequences for sin, said that “sin taxes” were part of the “nanny state”. This, however, is to confuse two authority figures. A nanny punishes naughtiness; sin is punished by God. The phrase “sin tax” is first recorded in 1901, in an article about a young women’s society in the US that fined its members for using slang. (“My sin tax!” exclaimed one as she paid up.) Its political use, to mean state levies on alcohol, tobacco and gambling, is attributed to Eisenhower’s chief of staff, Sherman Adams, during his previous time as governor of New Hampshire (1948-52). These days, to call something a “sin tax” is to express implicit disapproval at the overreach of the state, to imply – just as with the Republican use of “death tax” for inheritance tax – that it is not the government’s job to police great metaphysical questions. Alternatively, one might side with Oscar Wilde’s view that there is no sin except stupidity – and imagine the gigantic revenues if we could tax that.
