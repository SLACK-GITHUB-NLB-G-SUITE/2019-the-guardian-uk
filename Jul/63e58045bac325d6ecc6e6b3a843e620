At the end of a long country walk or an afternoon on the beach, retiring to a beer garden at a friendly pub is a brilliant way of finishing off the day. Sometimes the garden itself is a thing of beauty, with well-kept flower beds or an inviting lawn for kids to play on. Then, there are gardens that enjoy a super location overlooking a river, pretty village or rolling countryside. Whether it’s a city pub that makes the most of limited space or a rural haunt with a few acres to play with, please share your favourites. Of course it helps if the beer is top notch and the food delicious … so tell us about that too. Please send us your tips from all parts of the UK including exact locations, websites and food and drink details.
