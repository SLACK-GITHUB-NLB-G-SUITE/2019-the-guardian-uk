Is there anything, anything at all, that the Home Office does competently, fairly and in accordance with British principles of justice (Students urge Javid to act over unfair visa test cheating claims, 28 June)?Donald SimpsonRochdale, Greater Manchester • Michael Rosen asks us to compare the proportion of people eligible to vote for the new prime minister with those eligible to vote before the 1832 Reform Act (Education, 25 June). In a survey in 1780, 3% of the population was eligible to vote (214,000 out of a population of 8 million). The current sum defeated me but it’s about 160,000 out of an electorate of 45,775,000. I make that a vanishingly small proportion. Fair? Reasonable? Neither, I’d say.Linda RheadHampton, London • Emine Saner is right (G2, 27 June) – corsets are regressive. In the early 1960s, rubberised roll-on girdles were worn to hold stomachs in. They were uncomfortable and restrictive, sweaty and unhygienic. Relieved from the tyranny of these garments in the late 1960s, stomach muscles were rediscovered as a means of keeping stomachs flat. New mothers need encouragement with postnatal exercises to return to shape, not corsets.Carole DanielsSutton, Surrey • Fondly remembered too is the local paper which told how an eminent lady of the parish brought the church social to a close with a rendition of Lay Me in my Little Bed accompanied by the vicar (Letters, 1 July).Tony ScullIlkley, West Yorkshire • Any other Guardian readers out there not that interested in Glastonbury (G2, 1 July)?Michael CunninghamWolverhampton • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
