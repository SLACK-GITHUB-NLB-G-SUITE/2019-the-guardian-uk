My boyfriend and I are both in our mid-40s and divorced. His children are at primary school, mine are teenagers. Post-divorce, he met someone else with children, but it didn’t work out. I have told my kids that I am dating. We have been together six months, so I don’t want to introduce him to my children, or to meet his yet. But he has told his kids I am just a friend. We both take the relationship seriously. I understand that the situation is sensitive because of the previous failed relationship, but it hurts that he lies about me. Should I broach the subject, or keep quiet and let him tell his family in his own time? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
