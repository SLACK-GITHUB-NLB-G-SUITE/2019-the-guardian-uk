Police in northern Italy have detained three men, including one linked to a neo-fascist political party, after uncovering a huge stash of automatic weapons, a missile and material featuring Nazi symbols. Police said the discoveries stemmed from a previous investigation into Italians who took part in the Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Turin police said one of the men arrested had in 2001 run unsuccessfully as a senate candidate for the neo-fascist Forza Nuova party. They said they found nine assault weapons, nearly 30 hunting rifles, pistols and bayonets, ammunition and antique Nazi plaques featuring swastikas at the manâ€™s home in Gallarate. The two other men were detained after police found at an airport hangar a French-made missile that they apparently were seeking to sell.
