I like cooking. I like baking. I know we need light relief more now than ever, but I am quite sure I do not need Kim-Joy to tell me every week how to make faces from icing, or how to stick edible eyes to my bakes (Kim-Joy bakes, G2, 25 July). Enough!Della KerrDarlington, County Durham • A typically thoughtful review by Lucy Mangan of Inside the Bruderhof (Review, G2, 26 July). What a pity that the BBC replaced it without explanation with a different documentary. If Lucy has finished with her preview recording, can we borrow it please? We have relatives there.Delia and Peter CaswellWarrington, Cheshire • An advert for The Current War says “Power changes everything”. Only for men obviously. Of the six actors pictured, only four are named – all male of course – while two women remain anonymous. I assume the film must be celebrating the herald of a new dawn of intolerance?Helen DatsonChipping Norton, Oxfordshire • About 20 years ago I was appointed as chair of the Buckinghamshire health authority. Women were very much in a minority in the post at that time. The local paper headlined it “Granny gets top health job”. I have never seen the equivalent for grandads (Letters, 25 July).Irene ShortAylesbury, Buckinghamshire • It’s not just “grannies”. Those wanting to attract my attention here, such as bus drivers or security guards, call me “junger mann” which, though they mean well, is in its way just as irritating (I’m well over 70).Brian SmithBerlin, Germany • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
