I am as keen as anyone to see antisemitism rooted out of my party. For that reason I was quite pleased when the issue was referred to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (Dozens more will testify over Labour antisemitism, 12 July). I expect that body to look at the situation from all sides before then coming out with an objective judgment on what has been happening and what needs to be done. What I cannot understand is why the BBC on Panorama felt the need to make the sort of programme that it did, in advance of that inquiry. Is it not as if, when a notorious criminal case is known to be coming to court, some programme-maker decides that it would be acceptable to get together all the witnesses for the prosecution in advance to find out what they have to say about the situation?Bob AdamsonSkipton, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
