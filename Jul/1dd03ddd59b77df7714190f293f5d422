British grime star Stormzy has apologised for erroneously saying he was the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury music festival on Friday. The rapper, whose real name is Michael Omari, apologised on social media to Skin, the lead singer of Skunk Anansie, after she noted that she had headlined the famous event with her rock band in 1999. In a friendly exchange between the two musicians, Stormzy wrote on Twitter: “No disrespect intended I’m very sorry my apologies! Thank you for paving the way - love (and) respect.” Skin from the band Skunk Anansie was actually the first black artist to headline glasto she done it with her band in 1999 no disrespect intended and MASSIVE salute to you - my apologies ! ❤️ @skinskinny The confusion emerged over the weekend when the 25-year-old claimed on Twitter that he was “the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury”. Skin, whose real name is Deborah Anne Dyer, rebutted his claims in an Instagram post, writing “sorry Stormzy but we beat you to it in 1999!” She also noted her appreciation for the south London-born grime star, adding: “You’re amazing and we’re all very proud”. Stormzy is a cult figure in the British grime scene, which blends Jamaican dancehall and hip hop for a pulsating, hard-edged sound that first electrified London nearly two decades ago. British rockers Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and then reformed in 2009 – and are currently on tour in Europe.
