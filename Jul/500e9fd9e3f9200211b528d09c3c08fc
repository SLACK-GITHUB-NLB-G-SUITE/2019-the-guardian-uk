But then she saw someone with a wounded leg. “We were just leaving and we saw a guy with a bandana wrapped around his leg because he got shot,” Reyes told the newspaper. “There was a little kid hurt on the ground. People were throwing tables and cutting fences to get out.” Founded in 1979, the Gilroy Garlic Festival features food, drink, live entertainment and cooking competitions.

It was being held at the outdoor Christmas Hill Park, where weapons of any kind are prohibited, according to the event’s website.
