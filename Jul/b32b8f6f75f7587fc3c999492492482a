In the early hours of Thursday morning, New Zealanders collectively rubbed their tired eyes. On the other side of the world, something miraculous was happening. They could scarcely believe what they were seeing. In Manchester, on the second day of a Cricket World Cup semi-final that New Zealand were always meant to lose, the might of the Indian batting order was collapsing. It had come down to veteran MS Dhoni to carry the team to victory. He was India’s last hope. But in the 49th over, with 25 runs needed from 10 balls, Dhoni skied a ball to square leg. It was picked up by Martin Guptill, who until that point had endured a miserable tournament, producing just 94 runs with the bat. But in that moment, something clicked. Guptill picked up the ball and heaved it at the stumps, knocking the bails off with a direct hit. Dhoni’s bat was only inches away from being safe in the crease. Cue a collective, national outpouring of joy from every New Zealander who was still awake at 2am. “In that moment when he threw down the stumps, that is going to become one of the most iconic sporting moments in New Zealand folklore,” Alex Braae said on The Spinoff’s cricket podcast, The Offspin. “People are going to be talking about that runout until the heat death of the universe.” The rest of the Indian wickets fell easily to send New Zealand into the final for the second time in two tournaments. Indian fans despaired. Pakistani fans laughed. New Zealand fans simply revelled. “You wouldn’t read about it,” said Mike Lane of Alternative Cricket Commentary. “What an incredible comeback from a team that farted their way through … now they are going to the home of cricket, Lords.” Everyone from sporting legends, to finance ministers and even former prime minister Helen Clark had words of support for the team. Congratulations to the @BLACKCAPS #attitude @ London, United Kingdom https://t.co/ok4XnYa1ly Congratulations NZ @BLACKCAPS⁩ 🇳🇿 on win over India 🇮🇳 in #CricketWorldCup 🏏 semi-final. All eyes now on final in London at Lords. All the best! https://t.co/PfkOJEQhE1 One for the true believers. What a game from Kane Williamson with bat and with captaincy. How proud? PROUD @BLACKCAPS #NZvIND Breakfast television presenters brought sailors’ hats onto set, a reference to captain Kane “‘steady the ship” Williamson. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was more philosophical. “Wins and losses are a part of life,” he wrote on Twitter. A disappointing result, but good to see #TeamIndia’s fighting spirit till the very end.India batted, bowled, fielded well throughout the tournament, of which we are very proud. Wins and losses are a part of life. Best wishes to the team for their future endeavours. #INDvsNZ For Black Caps fans, losses have historically been a more prevalent part of their lives. Now, those ghosts will surface again, with memories of a similarly glorious entry to the previous final, which was soon followed by a lacklustre performance. Former Black Cap Grant Elliott, whose memorable six against South Africa took New Zealand to that final, urged them to go one better this time. What a game! #backtheblackcaps Finals time! Let’s go one better than 2015. Tired but energised New Zealand fans will have to wait until Sunday to see whether they can. If they do, and if Guptill scores a double century, Braae has vowed to get a tattoo of Guptill’s two-toed foot on his body in honour of the occasion.
