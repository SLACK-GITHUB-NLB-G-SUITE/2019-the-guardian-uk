Sir Kim Darroch appears to have carried out his remit scrupulously and honestly (Foreign Office inquiry after leak of ‘inept Trump’ memos, 8 July). Nigel Farage’s calls for him to be sacked provide a chilling insight into Farage’s idea of democracy. In his ideal world, ambassadors will say what their taskmasters wish to hear, not what they have been able to see and hear for themselves in their unique role as inside observers of foreign governments. In future, every diplomat must feel wary about making an honest report in the light of what has happened to Sir Kim.Ray JenkinCardiff • There is a simple solution to the current diplomatic impasse with President Trump (Trump turns on May as row over memos sours US ties, 9 July). It involves the American ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson IV, admitting that he has sent memos to Washington making identical comments on the UK prime minister and our political situation. Then our two regimes shout “snap”, and we all move on.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds • How convenient that after Donald Trump suggested Nigel Farage would make a good ambassador, a public row breaks out, embarrassing the existing post-holder.Sally PentonSouth Wonston, Winchester • I have always thought that a diplomat is a man who goes abroad to lie for his country. It seems that the current policy is for him to tell the truth.Nick WyattLondon • Trump’s reaction perfectly illustrates the accuracy of the ambassador’s assessment.Roger PaxtonMorpeth, Northumberland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
