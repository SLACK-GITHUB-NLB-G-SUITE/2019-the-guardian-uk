Fr Julian Dunn (Letters, 1 July) may be stirred to profane language about the dearth of poetry in the 100 best books for the summer piece, but he missed Raymond Antrobus’s The Perseverance in the section headed “Prize winners”. More would of course be welcome. How about a little Luke Wright to liven up an evening?Tom RankGlossop, Derbyshire • A poetry book for the summer? Fr Julian Dunn need look no further than any of Connie Bensley’s excellent collections.Penny BrownLewes, East Sussex • Campaigners think that the sounds proposed by Transport for London for electric buses are too futuristic. Perhaps they can imitate Steve Bell’s buses, trains and tractors (Sci-fi sounds to make electric buses safer hit wrong note for campaigners, 2 July), and go “boggler, boggler”. Preferably using a recording of Steve’s own wonderfully deep voice.Dr Warren KovachPentraeth, Anglesey • A headline in the Guardian several years ago read “Arsonists told to keep away from matches”, which related to youths setting fire to a football stadium (Letters, 2 July).Chris JonesBewdley, Worcestershire • My friend Leila remembers a headline about a criminal act which took place on the Sunday after Easter in Sutton-in-Ashfield: “Low deed in Low Street on Low Sunday.”Kate GrogginsLincoln • I appear to have the national collection of slugs and snails. But I am willing to relinquish a few if Ian Duncan (Letters, 2 July) or anyone else wants to restock their garden.Maggie JohnstonSt Albans, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
