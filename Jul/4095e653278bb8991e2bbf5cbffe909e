In a Belfast museum, embroiderers are at work depicting gory battles and warring kings in shimmering threads of red and gold – an epic homage to the TV phenomenon Game of Thrones. The team of volunteers at the Ulster Museum are putting the final touches to a 90-metre (300-foot) tapestry depicting all eight seasons of the fantasy saga, which concluded in May. Game of Thrones, which first hit screens in 2011, was produced and chiefly filmed in studios in Belfast and in the Northern Irish countryside. Valerie Wilson, costume and textiles curator at National Museums Northern Ireland, said tapestry was an ideal storytelling device. “The length of the tapestry allows the story to unfold, so in many ways it’s the perfect medium for telling the story of the Game of Thrones project.” Styled in the manner of the treasured Bayeux Tapestry – which depicts the 11th-century Norman conquest of England – the completed piece will be transported to France to hang near its predecessor in September. “This tapestry references the Bayeux Tapestry in that it has a series of repeated icons through it,” said Wilson. The panels of the piece are woven by machine before the finishing touches are put on by hand. A team of 30 has worked on and off for two years on the tapestry, stitching embellishments on icons such as “blood red weddings”, “emerald green wildfire” and “cold-blue White Walkers” that were pivotal the HBO drama. As they did their best to reflect the true nature of the at times extremely violent series, the museum display comes with a warning: “Due to the depiction of graphic scenes, viewing of the tapestry is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.” After completing series one to seven, the team is working on stitching the eighth and final series. Those contributing to the project – like actors in the show – have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements. “It was very crucial when the project launched that it had that new, fresh, almost surprise element,” Wilson said. After the embellishments are completed, the final panels will be added to the display of series one to seven already on show to Ulster museum visitors. “I think it’s really beautiful,” said Abbie Merrick – a diehard fan of Game of Thrones, who spent a morning walking her mother through the intricately woven plot. “I think tapestry’s a really beautiful art form and a really nice way of storytelling.” Episode 1: WinterfellEpisode 2: A Knight of the Seven KingdomsEpisode 3: The Long NightEpisode 4: The Last of the StarksEpisode 5: The BellsEpisode 6: The Iron Throne Episode 1: DragonstoneEpisode 2: StormbornEpisode 3: The Queen's JusticeEpisode 4: The Spoils of WarEpisode 5: EastwatchEpisode 6: Beyond The WallEpisode 7: The Dragon and the Wolf Episode 1: The Red WomanEpisode 2: HomeEpisode 3: OathbreakerEpisode 4: Book of the StrangerEpisode 5: The DoorEpisode 6: Blood of my BloodEpisode 7: The Broken ManEpisode 8: No OneEpisode 9: Battle of the BastardsEpisode 10: The Winds of Winter Episode 1: The Wars to ComeEpisode 2: The House of Black and WhiteEpisode 3: High SparrowEpisode 4: Sons of the HarpyEpisode 5: Kill the BoyEpisode 6: Unbowed, Unbent, UnbrokenEpisode 7: The GiftEpisode 8: HardhomeEpisode 9: The Dance of DragonsEpisode 10: Mother's Mercy Episode 1: Two SwordsEpisode 2: The Lion and the RoseEpisode 3: Breaker of ChainsEpisode 4: OathkeeperEpisode 5: First of His NameEpisode 6: The Laws of Gods and MenEpisode 7: MockingbirdEpisode 8: The Mountain and the ViperEpisode 9: The Watchers on the WallEpisode 10: The Children Episode 1: Valar DohaerisEpisode 2: Dark Wings, Dark WordsEpisode 3: Walk of PunishmentEpisode 4: And Now His Watch Is EndedEpisode 5: Kissed by FireEpisode 6: The ClimbEpisode 7: The Bear and the Maiden FairEpisode 8: Second SonsEpisode 9: The Rains of CastamereEpisode 10: Mhysa Episode 1: The North RemembersEpisode 2: The Night LandsEpisode 3: What Is Dead May Never DieEpisode 4: Garden of BonesEpisode 5: The Ghost of HarrenhalEpisode 6: The Old Gods and the NewEpisode 7: A Man Without HonourEpisode 8: The Prince of WinterfellEpisode 9: BlackwaterEpisode 10: Valar Morghulis Episode 1: Winter is ComingEpisode 2: The KingsroadEpisode 3: Lord SnowEpisode 4: Cripples, Bastards, and Broken ThingsEpisode 5: The Wolf and the LionEpisode 6: A Golden CrownEpisode 7: You Win or You DieEpisode 8: The Pointy EndEpisode 9: BaelorEpisode 10: Fire and Blood
