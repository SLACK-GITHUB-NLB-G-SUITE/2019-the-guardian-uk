Donald Trump Jnr is set to join his sister Ivanka, mother Ivana and father Donald Snr on the bookshelves with the announcement that he will be releasing his own literary effort later this year. His book is titled Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. It is due to be published on 5 November by Center Street, a conservative non-fiction publishing house that counts the former Republican speaker Newt Gingrich and the conservative commentator Gretchen Carlson among its authors. One description of the book says that Trump will “expose all the tricks that the left uses to smear conservatives” and says that “no topic is spared from political correctness”. Posting about the announcement on Monday, Trump wrote: “This is the book the leftist elites don’t want you to read!” This is the book the leftist elites don’t want you to read!

The book will reportedly span topics from Trump’s “childhood summers in communist Czechoslovakia that began his political thought process”, through to the “major achievements of president Trump’s administration”. This will be the third book published by a member of the president’s family since he took office. Women Who Work, by Ivanka Trump, was launched in May 2017; while Ivana Trump, Trump’s first wife and the mother of Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric Trump, released Raising Trump in October 2017.
