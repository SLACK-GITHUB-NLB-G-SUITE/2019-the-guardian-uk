I married quite late in life, to a woman 10 years younger than me. She earns a lot more than I do, and her career is booming, unlike mine, which has pretty much stagnated. We are both very relaxed about this. I don’t feel that my masculinity is threatened; it’s nice that, between us, we’re doing OK. I hope to retire in another 10 or 15 years, and I can’t wait! But would it be wrong to do that if she is still working? She would end up paying even more of the bills.  • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
