Marvel has announced that Loki, the villainous ‘God of Mischief’ played by Tom Hiddleston, will no longer play second fiddle to his brother Thor and will get his own series. Hiddleston appeared at Comic-Con this weekend to reveal more details about Loki, which will premiere on the upcoming streaming service, Disney Plus, on 7 May 2021. He said: “It is one of the most exciting creative opportunities I think I’ve ever come across. “This is new territory, a new world, new challenges and I cannot wait to get started.” Hiddleston’s character, the eternal thorn in Thor’s (Chris Hemsworth) side, died at the start of Avengers: Infinity War but magically reappeared as part of the gang’s time heist in Avengers: Endgame. Hiddleston took on the role as the abandoned Prince of Asgard discovered by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in 2011 in Thor and has starred in the subsequent sequels as well as the wildly popular Avengers films. The actor is due to make his Broadway debut in August in Harold Pinter’s Betrayal after a successful West End run. Hiddleston won widespread praise for his performance, with The Guardian’s theatre critic Michael Billington calling him “superb” at conveying the main character Robert’s emotional wounds. Disney Plus, which aims to compete with Netflix, is set to launch on 12 November in the US. Two other Marvel series have been announced that cross over from the Marvel cinematic world, The Falcon and Winter Soldier and WandaVision.
