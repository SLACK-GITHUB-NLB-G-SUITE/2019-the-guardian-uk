When the championships resume on Monday, the men’s fourth round will feature more players older than 30 than younger for the first time in the Open era. And only four seeds from the top 10 have survived – Novak Djokovic (1), Roger Federer (2), Rafael Nadal (3) and Kei Nishikori (8) – the fewest since 2008. There is certain to be at least one unseeded player in the quarter-finals, for the first time in four years. Nevertheless, there is a degree of certainty about most of Monday’s matches, traditionally a round when the outsiders fall away. It would be the shock of the season, for instance, if the four-times champion Djokovic, attempting to reach his 11th quarter‑final here, were to lose against the world No 66 Ugo Humbert, despite the French left-hander’s fine run of form. Likewise, the eight-times champion Federer should have way too much for the 17th seed Matteo Berrettini, and Nadal should cope easily enough with the Portuguese João Sousa, who is unseeded.

There will not be a lot between the 15th seed Milos Raonic and the surprise packet of the first week, Guido Pella (26). Of the other seeds, David Goffin (21) will have his hands full against the unseeded Fernando Verdasco, Roberto Bautista Agut (23) could lose against Benoît Paire (28), and, in an all-American contest of unseeded hopefuls, Sam Querrey’s big game may be too much for Tennys Sandgren.
