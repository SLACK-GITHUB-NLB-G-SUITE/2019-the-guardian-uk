Everton have concluded a deal with Juventus to sign Moise Kean for an initial €32m (£29m) and the forward is due to fly to England on Wednesday to finalise the move. The signing of the 19-year-old Italy international would be a significant coup for Everton, who have also sold the midfielder Idrissa Gueye to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee understood to be €32m. Everton could end up spending €40m on Kean with add-ons and have agreed to pay him £2.75m a year. Juventus had wanted a buy-back clause but instead they will be told of any bid so they can choose whether to match it. The player, who had one year remaining on his contract, scored six Serie A goals in 13 appearances last season and has played three times for Italy. Marco Silva had hoped to keep Gueye at Goodison Park this season but the player was determined to join the French champions. “I wanted to give a new boost to my club career by joining Paris St-Germain, one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in Europe,” Gueye told his new club’s website. Everton have made a substantial profit on the 29-year-old Gueye, who signed from Aston Villa for £8m in 2016. The Senegal international has previously played in France for Lille from 2008-15. Kean was among the Juventus players who had racist abuse directed at them by Cagliari fans during a game there in April. Kean reacted to monkey chants by celebrating in front of the home supporters after scoring.
