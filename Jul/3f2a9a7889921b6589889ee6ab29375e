Bernard Tomic has been fined his first-round £45,000 prize money by Wimbledon for a lack of effort in his defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The Australian, who was punished for a similar offence two years ago, has been hit with the sanction after the All England Club ruled he “did not perform to the required professional standard” during his 58-minute loss. Tomic, who can appeal against the charge, was rolling serves in and did not chase balls down as Tsonga wrapped up the quickest win in the men’s singles since 2004. A statement from Wimbledon read: “All players are expected to perform to a professional standard in every grand slam match. With respect to first round performance, if in the opinion of the referee the player did not perform to the required professional standard, the referee may determine that the player be subject to a fine of up to first round prize money. “It is the opinion of the referee that the performance of Bernard Tomic in his first round match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga did not meet the required professional standards, and therefore he has been fined the maximum amount of £45,000 which will be deducted from prize money.” Two years ago Tomic was fined more than £11,000 and dumped by his racket sponsor after saying in a press conference following a first-round loss to Mischa Zverev that he had felt bored during the match and had called the trainer when he was not injured. In May, Tomic lost 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 to Taylor Fritz in 82 minutes in the first round of the French Open.
