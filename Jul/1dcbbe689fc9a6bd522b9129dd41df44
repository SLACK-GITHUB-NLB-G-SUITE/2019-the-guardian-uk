Rui Patrício saved three penalties as Wolverhampton Wanderers defeated English champions Manchester City to claim the Premier League Asia Trophy 3-2 in a penalty shootout in Shanghai on Saturday. The Portuguese goalkeeper kept out spot-kicks from Ilkay Gündogan, David Silva and Lukas Nmecha as Nuno Espírito Santo’s Wolves side won the four-team pre-season tournament, which also featured Newcastle United and West Ham United, after the game ended goalless after 90 minutes. The match at Hongkou Stadium was a frustrating tale of missed penalties for Pep Guardiola’s side as Raheem Sterling was also off target from the spot during the game. Referee Martin Atkinson awarded City a penalty 20 minutes into the game when Leroy Sané was hauled down by the combined efforts of Conor Coady and Morgan Gibbs-White, only for Sterling, who had been in electric form in the opening exhanges, to send his spot-kick high and wide. Patrício was kept busy in the Wolves goal, called upon to make a routine save from Sterling within two minutes before pulling off a reflex save to keep out Aymeric Laporte’s close-range attempt. Wolves eventually broke out of the City stranglehold to put some pressure on City’s goal as the half wore on but it was Guardiola’s side who were looking the more likely to score. Patrício denied City again 13 minutes from the end, making a flying save to ensure substitute Silva’s free kick did not curl inside his left post. The underdogs held out at 0-0 in normal time despite City dominating possession. Earlier in the day, Yoshinori Muto gave Steve Bruce a winning start to life at Newcastle when the Japan international scored the only goal of the third-place play-off against West Ham. Bruce, who was appointed as Rafael Benítez’s replacement earlier in the week, watched from the stands as the unmarked Muto flicked home a Jamie Sherry cross 11 minutes before half-time to give Newcastle the win
