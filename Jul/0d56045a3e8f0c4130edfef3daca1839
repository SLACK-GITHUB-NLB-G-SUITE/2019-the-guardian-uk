The first trailer for The Irishman, the new Martin Scorsese gangster picture, has been released online. Based on the story of mob hitman Frank Sheeran and his rumoured involvement in the disappearance and murder of notorious union boss Jimmy Hoffa, The Irishman sees Scorsese reunite with De Niro for the first time since 1995’s Casino, as well as long-term collaborators Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel. Al Pacino, who plays Hoffa, is working with Scorsese for the first time. The film has attracted attention for its use of CGI to “de-age” De Niro as he plays the younger version of Sheeran, as well as allowing Pacino, aged 79, to more convincingly play Hoffa, who was 62 when he disappeared. The Irishman was selected as the opening film of the New York film festival, and will be released in cinemas and on Netflix in the autumn.
