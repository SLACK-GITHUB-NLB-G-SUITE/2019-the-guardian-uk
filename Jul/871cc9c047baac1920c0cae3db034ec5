A light, sharp and refreshing spritz with bitter citrus undertones – just the thing for a gathering on a warm summer’s evening. Serves 1 15ml Campari15ml dry white vermouth – we use Dolin Dry15ml gin – we use Portobello Road20ml fresh lemon juice20ml basic sugar syrup (equal parts water and sugar)Sparkling wine, to top – we use cava, because it’s a little drier Put the Campari, vermouth, gin, lemon juice and syrup into a large wine glass. Give it a gentle stir to mix, fill with ice and top with fizz. Put a pretty wedge of lemon in the top and enjoy. • Joe White, Henry C, Manchester M21
