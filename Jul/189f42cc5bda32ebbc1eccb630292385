Karen Carney has announced her retirement from football after a long and successful career. The England and Chelsea midfielder has made three substitute appearances at the World Cup in France and will call it a day after Saturday’s third-place play-off against Sweden, in which she could win a 144th cap. Carney made her first-team debut for Birmingham City at the age of 14 and also represented Arsenal, Chicago Red Stars and, since 2015, Chelsea. “I am incredibly proud to have achieved so much in the game but now is definitely the right time to retire,” the 31-year-old said on Friday. “To have played for England was my ultimate ambition and to do so at four World Cups and represent Team GB at a home Olympics was beyond the wildest dreams I had when first starting out. “I would like to thank everyone who has made this all possible from my family and friends, everyone I have played for and worked with and, of course, the England squad and staff. I owe everything I have to all of them.” Carney has scored 32 goals for England, whose manager, Phil Neville, said: “It’s been a privilege to work with her over the past 18 months but even more special has been the chance to get to know someone who is an incredible person and a special teammate. “While she will not want a fuss, Karen is someone who deserves total recognition and respect as a true legend of the game.”
