Rafael Benítez has said he wanted to sign a new contract at Newcastle but did not as he felt the club did not share his vision. The Champions League-winning coach left St James’ Park last week after three years in charge, which included winning the Championship and surviving for two years in the top flight. Benítez said that although there were “challenging” times he did not regret his decision to move to Tyneside and the only reason he was not still there was a disagreement with those who run the club about how they should move forward. “Thank you for three fantastic, exciting and, at times, challenging years,” Benítez, whose desire for greater investment in the squad was not shared by the owner Mike Ashley, wrote in an open letter to fans.

I wanted to stay, but I didn’t just want to sign an extended contract, I wanted to be part of a project. “Unfortunately it became increasingly clear to me that those at the top of the club did not share the same vision. “I’m very sad about that, but I do not regret for one moment my decision to come to Tyneside and I’m very proud about what we achieved together. I will always have you in my heart.” The Nice manager Patrick Vieira has become the latest to distance himself from the vacancy created by Benítez’s departure. As he welcomed his players back for pre-season training, the former Arsenal midfielder told a press conference: “I’m at Nice for the long run. I do not intend to go elsewhere. I have always felt good here and with the people around me. I do not see myself anywhere other than OGC Nice.”
