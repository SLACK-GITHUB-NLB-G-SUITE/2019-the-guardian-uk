Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Kendrick Norton has had his arm amputated after a car crash in the early hours of Thursday. Florida police said the 22-year-old’s Ford F250 overturned after hitting a concrete barrier. His injuries are not considered life-threatening but his agent, Malki Kawa, said the player had his arm amputated. With sadness, I can confirm that Kendrick Norton was in a car accident last night and suffered multiple injuries, including the amputation of his arm. We ask that you continue to pray for him. His family also asks that the public respect Kendrick’s privacy. “We were made aware this morning of a serious car accident involving Kendrick Norton,” said a statement from the Dolphins. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Kendrick and his family during this time.” Norton was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in 2018 after starring for the University of Miami. He joined the Dolphins last December and was competing for a roster spot this off-season.
