The new world No 1, Ash Barty, began her quest for a first Wimbledon title with a straight-forward 6-4, 6-2 win over Saisai Zheng of China on Tuesday. Fresh from winning her first grand slam title at the French Open and becoming the first Australian woman to top the rankings in 43 years, the 23-year-old was too good for the world No43, Zheng, as she wrapped up victory in one hour, 16 minutes. Zheng had taken a set off Barty in two of their three battles and when she fought back from 3-0 down to level at 3-3 in the first set thanks to some unforced errors from the Australian, it looked like it might be another tough battle. But Barty, serving powerfully and mixing up her game nicely, steadied the ship to take the opener. With the exception of Serena Williams, who did it in 2002 and 2016, the last woman to do the French Open and Wimbledon back to back was Steffi Graf in 1996. But Barty, playing with the confidence you would expect of a newly-crowned grand slam winner, has the game, the variety and the belief to suggest she could be the next to achieve the feat. An early break at the start of the second put her in control and she ran away with the second set to set up a clash with Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium in round two. The women’s singles champion, Angelique Kerber, meanwhile, began the defence of her title with a 6–4, 6–3 win over Germany’s Tatjana Maria on Centre Court.
