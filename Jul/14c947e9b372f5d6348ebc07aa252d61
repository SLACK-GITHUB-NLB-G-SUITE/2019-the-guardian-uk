After the premiere of his Ninth Symphony on 7 May 1824 in Vienna, Beethoven, who was deaf, had to be turned around to face the cheering audience. In turning their backs to the Ode to Joy (Farage and his MEPs turn their backs as parliament resumes, 3 July), were Nigel Farage and his cronies oddly trying to imitate him in Strasbourg, to show they are not just stone dead to any idea of common European culture but stone deaf to civility, good manners and the most sublime music ever written to the brotherhood of all human beings? Could someone tell Mr Farage the piece was originally commissioned by the London Symphony Society in 1817? But do not tell him the work was not first played in London as expected, or he will denounce the composer as another cheating foreigner trying to get our money. Anyway, I guess that Ludwig van would be now considered an undesirable alien by the Brexit party, and thus turned around at the border – disabled, a swindler and, worst of all, a grubby, untrustworthy German!Pablo Carbajosa Madrid, Spain • The European president is right to chastise the Brexit members for disrespecting the European anthem, but he could equally have commented on the disrespect the Liberal Democrats displayed with the crude sloganeering on their T-shirts. I find it bizarre that Vince Cable and his cohort rail about the lack of civility that swirls around the Brexit debate, yet stoop to this kind of undignified mud-slinging on the occasion of the opening of the new parliament. Whatever happened to Michelle Obama’s spiritually and morally uplifting maxim – “When they go low, we go high” – in our liberal political discourse?Christopher CoppockCardiff • The protesting Brexit MEPs each had a union flag on their desk. Perhaps someone should remind Farage and co that of the three nations represented on the union flag, two of them (Scotland and Northern Ireland) voted to remain.Joseph NicholsonEdinburgh • Can we assume that the Brexit party MPs will now stick to their principles and turn their backs on the generous salaries available for MEPs?Wendy CollinsBatley, West Yorkshire • As many have pointed out on social media, the Brexit party’s protest was identical to that of Germany’s Nazi party when members took their seats in Berlin’s Reichstag in 1926.
