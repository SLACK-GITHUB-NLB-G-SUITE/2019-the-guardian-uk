The Internazionale sporting director, Piero Ausilio, has travelled to London to meet Manchester United to see if his club’s offer to sign Romelu Lukaku has any chance of succeeding. This will be the first meeting between the two sides, with Inter ready to present their bid of a two-year loan followed by an obligation to buy, in a deal worth €70m (£63m). Inter’s offer comprises a €10m payment for the loan this summer and then further instalments of €30m in 2020 and €30m in 2021. Inter, however, are concerned that United will turn down the offer because of what happened two years ago when the Premier League club wanted to sign Ivan Perisic. Inter asked for €50m and refused United’s offer of €45m. Lukaku would like to join Inter and play for Antonio Conte, who wanted to sign the Belgian when in charge of Chelsea in 2017. Inter have signed five players this summer for a combined £54.8m. The purchases have been Valentino Lazaro (Hertha Berlin, £19.7m), Matteo Politano (Sassuolo, £18m), Eddie Salcedo (Genoa, £7.2m), Gabriel Brazão (Parma, £5.9m) and Lucien Agoumé (Sochaux, £4m) while Stefano Sensi has arrived from Sassuolo on loan.
