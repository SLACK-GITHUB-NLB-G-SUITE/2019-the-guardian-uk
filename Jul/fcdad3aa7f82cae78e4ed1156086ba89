We would love to hear your holiday memories and mishaps. You might have stayed in an oddball hotel, got hopelessly lost on a walk, got off the ferry at the wrong island, ordered something in a restaurant that was infinitely better, or worse, than what you thought you’d asked for … Or just tell us about one holiday that stands out from all the others. Send tips from all parts of the world by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 6 August 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here. Read the terms and conditions
