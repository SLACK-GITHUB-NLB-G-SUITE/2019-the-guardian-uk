With a soupçon of schadenfreude, I bring you news this morning that the rulers of British racing have performed a reverse ferret over a Hampshire-based racehorse with an arguably rude French name. Je M’En Fous, a filly in the stable of Patrick Chamings, has become Je M’En Fiche, to spare the blushes of any follower of the sport with especially delicate sensibilities. Both these French expressions could be roughly translated as ‘I Don’t Care’ but Je M’En Fous is more forceful and carries more risk of offence, or so I’m told by my man on the rails at Deauville. He says the filly’s name has essentially changed from ‘I Don’t Give A Toss’ to ‘I Don’t Give A Hoot’. The naming team at Weatherbys consulted with their French counterparts when the owner registered Je M’En Fous last summer. “Tout va bien,” they were told. You have nothing to worry about, this is a perfectly good name for a racehorse. But after she actually ran, members of the public got in touch with the British Horseracing Authority to ask, “Er, are you sure about this? I would not use such a phrase in front of my grand-mere.” So the BHA reopened the conversation with France-Galop, who, at this point, conceded that they would not have allowed the name themselves. And so the BHA told connections, changez ce nom immediatement. And so they have, though the change is subtle. If you’re studying the form for Salisbury on Saturday, remember that Je M’En Fiche is really Je M’En Fous. Mind you, they might need to change rather more than her name if she is to ever actually win something. It’s Pipalong day at Pontefract, where Clon Coulis (3.15) is napped at 2-1 in the main race. She finished strongly to win the same race last year and went in again at Listed level the next time, at Ascot. She ran a huge race in the Royal Hunt Cup three weeks ago, failing only by a nose to catch Afaak after a slightly troubled passage. She gets just 3lb from last year’s Guineas winner, Billesdon Brook, so this is no gimme. The David O’Meara / Danny Tudhope team were back among the winners yesterday and I like their chances in the opener with Infinite Grace (2.15), making her handicap debut on ground more suitable than she got at Catterick last time. She’s 11-2. Sandra’s Secret (3.45) has had a break since a couple of disappointing efforts in better races. This front-runner could make them all go from trap one in a first-time visor and is now 3lb below her last winning mark, so 9-1 is tempting. Pick of the Wolverhampton card could be Arnoul Of Metz (3.00) at 11-2. The last time David Probert was booked, last summer, this horse won here from a slightly higher mark. He’s been running reasonably well under a 5lb claimer.
