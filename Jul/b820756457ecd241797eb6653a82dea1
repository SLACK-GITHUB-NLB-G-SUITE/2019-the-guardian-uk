About 50 German teenagers rioted as they attempted to free a 15-year-old reveller from police custody after he disrupted a school-leavers’ party, police in Bavaria have said. The police said only a large-scale show of force restored order after the teenagers threw bottles at the windows of the police station in Starnberg, near Munich, and tried to break open the entrance door late on Thursday. A window was broken and officers from neighbouring towns were called in to help restore order. “Only through a massive deployment... could the situation on site be brought under control,” said a statement from Bavarian police. Three teenagers were arrested and charged with attempting to free a prisoner and damage to property. Events escalated after police were called to a disturbance at a party in the affluent rural town on Thursday night. A 15-year-old, who appeared drunk, “provoked and insulted” officers in “an aggressive manner” and refused to leave. After the boy was taken into custody, a group of teenagers left the party and tried to storm the police station. Police are considering charges of breach of the peace.
