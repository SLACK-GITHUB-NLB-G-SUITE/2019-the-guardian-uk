Cameroon, the holders, will face the three-time Africa Cup of Nations winners Nigeria in the last 16 of the 2019 edition after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Benin, who sealed their place in the knockout stages for the first time. Clarence Seedorf’s side needed a victory to guarantee they progressed from Group F in first place but found a stubborn Benin side hard to break down in Ismailia and had to settle for second. They now play Gernot Rohr’s side in Alexandria on Saturday, with the hosts, Egypt, potentially waiting in the quarter-finals. Michel Dussuyer’s Benin team held on for a point that means they progress as one of the four best third-placed teams, but will face a tough test against unbeaten Morocco in Cairo on Friday.
