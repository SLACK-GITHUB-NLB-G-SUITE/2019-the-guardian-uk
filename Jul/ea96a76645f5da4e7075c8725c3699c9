The WNBA has suspended Los Angeles Sparks guard Riquna Williams 10 games for a domestic violence incident, one of the longest punishments in the league’s history. The league office handed down the suspension on Tuesday. Williams was arrested on 29 April and charged with two felony counts, one involving the assault of an individual with whom she was in a relationship and the other involving a threat to another person with a firearm. Her criminal case is ongoing. Authorities said Williams repeatedly struck ex-girlfriend Alkeria Davis after forcing her way into her Florida home in December. According to police records, Williams went to her car after the altercation, placed a firearm on the trunk, pointed it at a bystander and said “you’ll get all 18” before fleeing the scene. The league conducted its own investigation and consulted with a panel of experts in the field of domestic violence. Among other factors, the WNBA said it took into account the nature and seriousness of the allegations, including the involvement of a gun. The WNBA also will require Williams to participate in counseling. The seven-year WNBA veteran, who played four seasons with the Tulsa Shock before moving to the Sparks in a trade, set the WNBA single-game scoring record with 51 points in a 2013 game against San Antonio, a mark since broken by the Australian center Liz Cambage. Williams, 29, is averaging 11.5 points and 2.7 rebounds in 15 games with the Sparks this year. Her suspension will begin with Thursday’s game against the Dallas Wings.
