I was surprised to find no mention in your report (Floating into space: Branson reveals plans to list Virgin Galactic on stock exchange, 10 July) of the environmental costs of using a huge aircraft and a rocket ship to give super-rich clients a few minutes in space. How many hard-working families do we need to persuade to give up their annual holiday in the sun to offset the carbon footprint of one of Branson’s flights of fancy?Mike BattyeCrewe, Cheshire • The Liverpool player Ian Callaghan’s destruction of Queen’s Park Rangers in the 1970s led to the famous headline “Super Cally goes ballistic, QPR atrocious” (Letters, 8 July). My favourite, however, is Kevin Brennan MP’s comment about the lack of government investment in Wales being headlined locally as “The last quango in Powys”.Steve Pound MPLabour, Ealing North • Re Britain’s greatest tennis player (Letters, 8 July), Dorothea Lambert Chambers won seven Wimbledon singles titles between 1903 and 1914.John JenkinsBow Street, Ceredigion • The “buy a saw in ’74” response to “plant a tree in ’73” did not come from Monty Python (Letters, 9 July).

Please don’t. At the very least it has to be animal cruelty, in addition to what the humans do to one another.Ann NewellThame , Oxfordshire • The problem with Izal (Letters, 9 July) was not so much its softness but its slipperiness – and the smell.Lesley BarnesGreenford, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
