There are few natural landscape features as thrilling as torrents of water hurtling down cliffs, whether they are in Iceland, the Highlands, Yorkshire, Croatia, Brazil, Hawaii or Australia – the homes of some of the most celebrated. Many can only be reached at the end of long treks that make for adventure stories in themselves. Others have their own car parks, cafes and even hotels. Some can only be reached by taking a boat up a fjord or sea loch. Tell us about brilliant cascades anywhere, but bear in mind that we’ll only be publishing one entry for each waterfall, so if you tip the most famous (such as Victoria Falls or Niagara), you’re less likely to make the shortlist. And size isn’t all that matters; brilliant walks, views and landscapes are just as important. The experience is the thing. Please include details of how you reached the waterfall – whether it was a walk, a boat trip or a drive – and any information that would improve the experiences of other visitors. Any useful websites and, where relevant, places to stay should also be included. We would love to hear about your discoveries. Send tips from all parts of the world by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
