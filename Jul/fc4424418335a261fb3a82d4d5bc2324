Chris Froome has officially been named as the winner of the 2011 Vuelta a España following a doping case involving Juan José Cobo, who originally finished in first place. It is Froome’s seventh Grand Tour title and first chronologically. Bradley Wiggins did not win the Tour de France until the following July, so Froome’s retrospective victory also makes him Britain’s first Grand Tour winner. Cycling’s world governing body, UCI, announced last month that the now-retired Cobo had been found “guilty of an anti-doping violation (use of a prohibited substance) based on abnormalities from 2009 and 2011 detected in his biological passport” and ruled him ineligible for a period of three years. The Spaniard had 30 days to appeal against the sanction but apparently has failed to do so, with the UCI updating the results on its official website, declaring Froome the winner with Team Sky colleague Wiggins in second place. Cobo, riding for Geox-TMC, had beaten Froome by 13 seconds eight years ago, with Wiggins in third, one minute and 39 seconds down. Dutch rider Bauke Mollema completes the revised podium. Froome adds the title to his Tour de France wins in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017, his Vuelta win in 2017, and the 2018 Giro d’Italia crown. News of Cobo’s doping violation came just a day after Froome was involved in a horror crash during a reconnaissance ride at the Critérium du Dauphiné, in which he suffered a broken femur and ribs, ending his hopes of a record-equalling fifth Tour de France crown this July. The 34-year-old spent a full three weeks in hospital before being released for rehabilitation, and has this week been riding on an indoor training bike using one leg.
