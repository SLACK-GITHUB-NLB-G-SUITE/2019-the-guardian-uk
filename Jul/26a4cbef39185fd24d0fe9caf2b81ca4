The excellent obituary of Bryan Marshall (25 July) failed to mention his episode of Granada TV’s A Family at War. I had a few lines in the episode where he played a Polish soldier called Stashek; he was brilliant but it says something about this country that he had to go to Australia for work. The list goes on; Del Henney died this year too – such a waste.Chris SullivanPinner, London • Jacob Rees-Mogg’s list of rules for his staff (Rees-Mogg Esq bans metric and hopes never to hear ‘hopefully’, 27 July) betrays his own lack of accuracy. Full stop is two words, not one; he has misspelt privy counsellor; and, as any touch typist knows, the double space after full stops went out with manual typewriters, as it is not required when using a PC.Cherry WestonWolverhampton, West Midlands • Are we now required to specify our lightbulbs in horsepower?Peter RedmanDorchester, Dorset • Mike Hine (Letters, 29 July) might want to avoid Screwfix in Oxford. In the space of a couple of minutes on Saturday I was addressed as fella, chap, guy, buddy and mate by just one counter assistant. A simple Esquire would have sufficed.Gabriel BrodetskyBeckley, Oxfordshire • What a disappointing Monday morning in this new era! How we miss that picture of the prime minister attending church.Roger Hill (Canon)Littleborough, Lancashire • Facial recognition cannot tell my twin sons apart on Facebook (The briefing, 29 July).Lesley BarnesGreenford, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
