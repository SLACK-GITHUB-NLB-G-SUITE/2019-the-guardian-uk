Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid’s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. Is anyone else getting strong placeholder vibes from this episode? Serena’s character arc appears to have become an infinity loop as, after the briefest sniff of baby Nicole’s head, she now seems hellbent on getting the tot back and sewing June’s mouth shut. That’s quite the 180. Meanwhile, the feeling is mutual as June confides in us regarding the Waterfords: “May they both get hit by a fucking truck.” The brief Serena/June alliance looks dead in the water and all is gloom and subjugation in Gilead, for a change. Even the Swiss are no help. Commander Lawrence tells June to pack for Washington where she’s due to be “borrowed” by Fred and Serena for a series of bizarre broadcasts. What these broadcasts are supposed to do is unclear, but if they’re hoping to further freak out the rest of the world by parading gagged women before the cameras, they’re doing a super job. In a coach with red drapes at the windows, Lydia accompanies June to her temporary posting and the handmaid looks out of the window to see that the Washington Monument has been made into the shape of a cross. “Are you pumped, dear?” Lydia asks her. How could she be when she is surrounded by handmaids wearing Gilead’s version of the scold’s bridle. “Blessed are the silent,” says the woman who greets June as she realises that the handmaids in the capital appear to be gagged as well as cowed. Fred’s “All together again. Isn’t this nice?” doesn’t go down well with either woman as he takes his wife and former handmaid to the home of the incredibly potent Commander Winslow. He has approximately 82 children and Serena is immediately handed a baby to hold while Mrs Winslow deals with the others. Fred looks to be up to his tricks again, using Serena’s longing for the baby to keep her in harness. While Fred and Serena negotiate their separate sleeping arrangements, June’s roomie shows up in the full bridle. The sight of Ofgeorge’s mouth stapled shut with metal hoops is genuinely shocking. June heaves silently into her own hand. The next day, Lydia pulls one of the bridles down to see the metal hoops for herself, like a child peering at a dead mouse. At the first of Fred’s overblown broadcasts, June and Nick are reunited and allow themselves a very risky hand touch. June and Serena’s shaky alliance crumbles entirely as the handmaid’s “Our girl deserves better” is met with stony indifference. Later, when they have that brief but explosive meeting in front of the Lincoln Memorial, things get even worse. The brief hope brought by Canada’s possible brokering of a deal with June via the Swiss is short-lived and ultimately feels a bit half-hearted. Or at least, the Swiss negotiator’s reasons for not going ahead with it – due to Nick being a soldier in the crusade that saw the regime take power – do. June and Nick’s reunion in the dead of night is briefly joyful, but she’s using him to get leverage with the Swiss. When they won’t work with him, Nick goes immediately to the front in Chicago, leaving his lover raging as all her allies seem to have disappeared overnight. The next day, the moment with June and Lydia and the bridle is a confusing one. While Lydia tells her that she doesn’t want all the handmaids silenced, she is clearly fascinated by the idea and straps June tightly into hers before the broadcast. In front of the smashed-up Lincoln Memorial, wife and handmaid face off. “That’s nice. The silence,” snarks Serena unnecessarily. There is no way the woman who suffered amputation for speaking up wants all women to have their mouths stapled shut. “I should have put a ring on your mouth the day I met you,” Serena says. June’s “I should have let you burn when I had the chance” is equally venomous but entirely justified. Yet I just don’t buy Serena’s about-face. It’s the sticking point of this episode. She was all but ready to burn the regime to the ground and now she has had a personality transplant. When she goes, June leans on Lincoln’s chair and cries for the America she knew. She puts her wings back on and raises the bridle back to her mouth. Walking out into the sunshine she sees row after row of handmaids. Fred and Serena take their place on the steps and survey the ranks. The cameras are ready. At the appointed moment, June kneels and all the other handmaids follow. We see the Washington Monument, made into a cross, reflected in her eyes. It all looked very beautiful this week, but the character-driven stuff was problematic for me. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. As June walks away from the Swiss we hear Everyday by Buddy Holly. Is it getting closer? The revolution? It feels further away than ever. A plethora of top shots again this week but I particularly enjoyed June’s red umbrella moving through the sea of black ones like an errant blood cell. Birds hop about in a cage at the Winslow house. Is this a heavy-handed metaphor? The one glimmer of light tonight was June’s face when she realised her audio cassette had reached Luke in Canada. Olivia Winslow’s admiration for Serena’s book seems like a risky transgression in such a devout city. Surely she would be too fearful to talk about the written word, being a woman and all.
