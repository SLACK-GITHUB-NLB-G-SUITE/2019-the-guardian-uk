The clamor from disgruntled Game of Thrones fans for a do-over of the drama’s final season has been in vain. HBO’s programming chief, Casey Bloys, said on Wednesday there was no serious consideration for remaking the story that some viewers and critics called disappointing. The eighth and final season of the hit show, which wrapped in April, was met with outrage by many viewers who complained of rushed episodes, implausible plot twists, and an apparent disdain for characters of color. A petition demanding that HBO remake the season “with competent writers” posted on Change.org has attracted more than 1.6m signatures and counting. There are few downsides to having a hugely popular show like Game of Thrones, Bloys said, but one is that fans have strong opinions on what would be a satisfying conclusion. Bloys said during a TV critics’ meeting that it came with the territory, adding that he appreciated fans’ passion for the saga based on George RR Martin’s novels. Emmy voters proved unswayed by petitioners demanding a remake: they gave Game of Thrones a record-breaking 32 nominations earlier this month. The series also brought record viewership for the network, with the series finale becoming the most watched episode in HBO’s history, according to analytics. HBO will want to keep the fan fervor alive for the prequel to Game of Thrones in the works. The first episode completed taping in Ireland and the dailies look “really good”, Bloys said. The planned series stars Naomi Watts and is set thousands of years before the original. Asked whether negative reaction to the Game of Thrones conclusion would shape the prequel, Bloys replied: “Not at all.”
