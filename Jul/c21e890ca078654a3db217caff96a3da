Liverpool’s Champions League hero Divock Origi has ended doubts over his future by signing a long-term contract. The Belgium international, who sealed Liverpool’s sixth European Cup triumph against Tottenham in June and their place in the final, signed the extension following several months of negotiation. Origi’s deal does not contain a release clause and completes a remarkable turnaround for the striker under Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool were open to offers for the 24-year-old last summer and in January but were unable to secure their asking price for a player who spent the 2017-18 season on loan at Wolfsburg. His attitude and work rate in training earned another opportunity under Klopp last season, however, and the forward repaid his manager with late winners against Everton and Newcastle as well as his contribution in the Champions League. Origi, who had entered the final year of his contract and had attracted interest from Real Betis this summer, is scheduled to feature in the team’s first pre-season friendly at Tranmere on Thursday.
