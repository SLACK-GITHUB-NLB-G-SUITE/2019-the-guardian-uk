A bumper payout for the Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe despite the collapse of a planned merger with Asda is expected to prompt questions at the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. At least two shareholder advisory groups have told Sainsbury’s investors to vote against the remuneration report in protest against Coupe’s £251,000 pay rise to £3.9m despite a fall in the supermarket’s share price and profits. That rise included a near 40% increase in Coupe’s annual bonus to £593,000, according to the annual report. Annual pre-tax profits dived 42% to £239m in the year to 9 March after £396m of one-off costs, including the £46m cost of preparing a deal with Asda, which was crushed by the competition regulator in April. Pirc, the shareholder advisory firm, told investors that Coupe’s variable pay – which includes cash and share payouts – was “considered excessive” at 271.5% of salary and that his pay, balanced against the financial performance of the business, was “not considerable acceptable” given the returns for shareholders. That came after Glass Lewis, another advisory group, told shareholders Sainsbury’s had failed to outline how the failed merger with Asda had affected executive bonuses. It suggested there had been a “divergence of bonus outcome from shareholder experience”. The Sainsbury’s annual report said Coupe received the payout because he had met minimum profit and personal targets, including the integration of Argos and continuing development of business strategy. On Wednesday, as he revealed a disappointing fall in quarterly sales, Coupe defended his pay deal saying it had been set by the company’s remuneration committee based on a series of targets. “My performance and the business performance is what determines the overall package,” he said. “There have been many years when year on year pay has fallen.”
