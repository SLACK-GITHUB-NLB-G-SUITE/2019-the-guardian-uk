West Ham are increasingly confident of signing Sébastien Haller after holding positive talks with Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. Manuel Pellegrini is desperate for a new striker after allowing Marko Arnautovic to join Shanghai SIPG for £22.4m and losing out to Valencia in the race to sign Maxi Gómez. West Ham have moved on quickly after the latter and believe they could reach an agreement to sign Haller by the end of the week. It is thought that Frankfurt are holding out for £40m for the 25-year-old, who has scored 33 goals in 77 appearances since joining from Utrecht two years ago. There was a fear that the France Under-21 international was reluctant to move to the London Stadium. However, West Ham believe he now favours a move to the Premier League. Pellegrini’s only senior strikers are Javier Hernández and Jordan Hugill following the departures of Arnautovic, Andy Carroll and Lucas Pérez. He could seek to sign another forward even if Haller arrives.
