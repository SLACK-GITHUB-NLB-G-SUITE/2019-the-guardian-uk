Arjen Robben has retired from football aged 35 following a trophy-laden career at club level and having earned 96 caps for his country, which included playing in a World Cup final. He said: “As everyone knows I have taken time after my last game at Bayern Munich to make a decision over my future. And I have now decided to end my career as a professional footballer.” Robben won 12 league titles – eight with Bayern, including last season, two at Chelsea and one each at PSV Eindhoven and Real Madrid – and was part of the Netherlands team that lost to Spain in the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg. “My love for the game and the conviction that I can still take on the world was up against the reality that things haven’t always gone the way I would have hoped and that I’m no longer a youngster of 16 who has no idea what injures can do to you,” said Robben, who has been beset with injury, particularly in his last seasons in the Bundesliga. He added: “It is maybe a cliche but there is nothing nicer than playing for your country. I finally said goodbye after 96 caps. I was able to take part in six major tournaments and, in my last years, captained the team. Altogether an unforgettable time that I will always treasure. “It is now time for the next chapter and I’m looking forward to spending more time with my wife and children and enjoy all the good things that lie ahead for us.”
