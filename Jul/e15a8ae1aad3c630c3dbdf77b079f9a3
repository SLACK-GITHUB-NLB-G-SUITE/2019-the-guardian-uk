Bury will start the League One season with a 12-point deduction after entering a company voluntary arrangement, the EFL has announced. The club, promoted last season, had a winding-up petition over unpaid debts adjourned at the high court last month and have secured their future with the CVA. “The club has now suffered an insolvency event and will be subject to a 12-point deduction,” said an EFL statement. “In accordance with EFL regulations, the sporting sanction will take effect immediately and the club will start the League One season on minus 12 points. The club has seven days to appeal. “The EFL will now continue its discussions with the club’s ownership with the aim of achieving a long-term future for the club.” Bury’s chairman, Steve Dale, who was involved in an angry confrontation with a group of supporters during Saturday’s friendly at Nantwich Town, described it as “a major day for our beloved club”. He told Bury’s website: “The old girl is safe. The CVA was passed, so our future is secured, as I said I would. We have worked tirelessly to achieve the result today whilst taking a lot of flak. Some might say our methods were questionable but we can all pass comment with hindsight. My job was to save Bury FC and that’s done. We have other hurdles but the main one is complete.” Dale hit out at his critics and those who had brought his family into an acrimonious situation. He said: “I can’t see how attacking my family has anything to do with Bury FC issues, but again it’s the same mindless few.”
