One of your contributors on racism in British higher education noted that academics at her university are overwhelmingly “white British and mostly mediocre” (Report, 6 July). I don’t disagree, but I wonder to what extent the same could be said for newsroom journalists? The focus on elite, select, Russell Group universities reflects a milieu in which most journalists originate and feel comfortable with, but the exclusion of less prestigious institutions is a shame. The recent Augar review belatedly noted the importance of post-1992 HE and FE. More and more studying and working experiences happen away from the dreaming spires and ivory towers which are so often in the media eye. There is nothing mediocre about my BME, female and working-class colleagues and students and the efforts they put in to make our university what it is. Their experiences of racism, sexism, bullying and harassment are just as important and at least as reflective of wider British culture as the distressing experiences of students and staff in the Russell Group.Dr Tom HoctorLuton, Bedfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
