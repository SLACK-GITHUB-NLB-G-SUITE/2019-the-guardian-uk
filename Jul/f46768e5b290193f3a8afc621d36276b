West Ham are resigned to losing out to Valencia in the race to sign Maxi Gómez from Celta Vigo. Manuel Pellegrini was desperate to land Gómez after allowing Marko Arnautovic to join Shanghai SIPG for €25m this week and West Ham were prepared to break their transfer record to sign the 22-year-old striker for €50m (£44.5m). However Gómez has long favoured a move to Valencia, who can offer Champions League football, and it is understood the La Liga club struck a deal with Vigo on Tuesday afternoon. They will pay in the region of €16m and also send Santi Mina and loan Jorge Sáenz to Vigo. Gómez’s contract contains a €50m release clause. Although West Ham were willing to part with that, La Liga rules state the sum must be paid in full to trigger the clause. West Ham wanted to pay in instalments and have struggled to reach an agreement with Vigo, who are under no obligation to accept those terms. Pellegrini will move quickly to identify new targets. Along with allowing Arnautovic to move to the Chinese Super League West Ham have sold Lucas Pérez to Alavés and released Andy Carroll, leaving Jordan Hugill and Javier Hernández as their only recognised forwards. However, they are unlikely to move for Callum Wilson. It is understood that Bournemouth want £70m for the England striker. Villarreal have signed Alberto Moreno on a five-year contract after the left-back’s release by Liverpool.
