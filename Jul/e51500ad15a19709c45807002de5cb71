Billionaire inventor James Dyson has bought a £59m luxury penthouse, thought to be the most expensive flat in Singapore, months after the prominent Brexit supporter announced plans to move his company from the UK to the island city-state. Dyson, 72, who invented the bagless vacuum cleaner and is working on an electric car, bought a 99-year lease on the vast flat in Singapore’s prestigious Wallich Residence, according to property records. The purchase was first reported by the Singapore Business Times, which said Dyson and his wife Deirdre paid $73.8m (£59m), which was about $5m less than the asking price displayed on the website of developer GuocoLand. A spokesman for Dyson said: “Given the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company’s business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there.” Dyson has come under fire for professing his support for Brexit, only to move his company’s headquarters to Singapore before the UK has completed its exit from the EU. The inventor has said Brexit had nothing to do with the decision. He also denied Singapore’s corporation tax rate, which is 17% compared with 19% in the UK, was a factor. Before announcing the company’s headquarters would move to Singapore, Dyson had already chosen to build its planned electric vehicle there, with the first due to roll off the production line in 2021. The company cited Singapore’s proximity to fast-growing Asian economies.
