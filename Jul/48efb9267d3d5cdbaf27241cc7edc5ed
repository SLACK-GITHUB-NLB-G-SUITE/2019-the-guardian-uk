Kolpak cricketers could be gone from the county game by 2021 in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to updated guidance from the England and Wales Cricket Board. Kolpak signings as well as those with EU passports are eligible to feature without counting as an overseas player, employment rulings which would both be directly affected by the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the European Union. The governing body has issued an email to the 18 first-class counties noting a series of potential implications, noting the political uncertainty surrounding the project but offering some clarity on the various possibilities. One such outcome involves the UK departing from the EU on 31 October without an agreement, which has frequently been floated by the incoming prime minister Boris Johnson. In that case new Kolpak registrations would be impossible and existing deals would likely cease at the end of the 2020 season. There are dozens of Kolpaks presently signed to counties, with the most high-profile including the former South Africa internationals Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Duanne Olivier, Simon Harmer and Kyle Abbott. Some would be sure to earn overseas deals in the event of their current status being revoked but many more would expect to leave the county circuit.
