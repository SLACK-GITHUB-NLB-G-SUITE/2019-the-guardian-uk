UK drill music and balaclavas are closely entwined: artists such as SL, AM and LD are known for wearing masks while performing. The reasons for this accessory are multi-faceted – anonymity, avoiding surveillance, sometimes just because it looks cool. Emerging south Londoner K Trap has been wearing a balaclava (or “bally”) since his music career started in 2017. In a recent video, he explained it was a personal decision in his post-prison life; wearing a balaclava meant being able to develop his artistry and rap about his past without people knowing who he was. Since his debut solo track David Blaine, K Trap has found huge underground acclaim via two impressive tapes. In his recent Big Mood video, in a move that feels symbolic of the next stage of his rise, K Trap finally appears unmasked, albeit with his name still unknown (although some fans point out if you follow him on Snapchat, you’ve probably already seen his face). In any case, his latest mixtape, No Magic, is a further step away from straight drill. With an array of spiralling, fluid production, K Trap’s third full-length release finds him distilling and championing local sounds, from cold drill to club heat. Subject-wise, he raps from his life – documenting childhood, the realities of once selling drugs, as well as looking forward to something bigger – all in a matter-of-fact, commanding style. Recently signed to Black Butter (the same label as Octavian and J Hus), and with the mask now off, odds are he’ll get even more ambitious as he goes. K Trap’s UK tour starts in Newcastle on 3 Sept and ends in London on 12 Sept
