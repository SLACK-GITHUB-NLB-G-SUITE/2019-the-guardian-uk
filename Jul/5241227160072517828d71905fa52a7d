Re Richard Evans’ obituary of Norman Stone (26 June): what Evans says has truth in it, but it’s far from the whole truth. Stone was a brilliant teacher, hilarious company, a fascinating lecturer, and a charming admirer. And, which is surely the point about #MeToo, he didn’t get shirty or use it against you if you said no – which is why some of us didn’t. His becoming so rightwing and drunk in later life was a pity, but earlier he was a doll.Louisa YoungLondon • The argument Bernie Evans makes about Cambridge Pre-U and independent school pupils (Letters, 29 June) does not add up. Cambridge Pre-U can be taken by students from state schools as well as independent schools, and the number of state schools offering Cambridge Pre-U is increasing each year. What Cambridge Pre-U – fully regulated as it is by Ofqual – offers students from all social backgrounds, and all types of school, is first-class preparation for studying at university.Christine ÖzdenChief executive, Cambridge Assessment International Education • The caption for the beautiful photo of a puffin on the Farne Islands (Weathering the storm, 28 June) refers to them as “remote”. They may be remote from London, but from our perspective they are local. Frequent daily boat trips carry thousands of visitors from Seahouses to the islands, just a few miles offshore, throughout the summer.Barbara and Tony SimpsonEyemouth, Scottish Borders • After some monkeys were stolen from Chessington Zoo years ago, the local paper ran the headline “Primate suspect held” (Letters, 3 July).Mary ReidChessington, London • Are the Lionesses heroes or heroines (England’s dream ends in heartache after VAR drama, 3 July)?Jim McLeanLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
