Jofra Archer may be held back from the first Ashes Test, the England coach, Trevor Bayliss, said. The pace bowler was outstanding in the World Cup, bowling the decisive super over in the final, and is in the squad for Edgbaston on Thursday. But Bayliss said he wanted to avoid damaging Archer’s recovery from a sidestrain. “We don’t want to necessarily risk him,” Bayliss told Radio 5 Live. “He played for Sussex in a T20 match and came through that well. Test match cricket, five days, longer spells, is a little bit of a different beast so we’ll have to see where he’s at and take a little bit from the medical people as well … We’ve got a good strong group of bowlers who we think can do the job over the five Tests.” Bayliss said he had a “fairly stern chat” with England’s players after they rallied to avoid an embarrassing Test defeat by Ireland. England were bowled out for 85 in the first session but eventually won by 143 runs. The nightwatchman Jack Leach was England’s top-scorer with 92 in the second innings. “It’s good to be able to deliver those messages when you have actually won a game,” Bayliss said. “I thought the example Jack Leach showed was the example a lot of the other batters need to learn from. “He was very focused on what he wanted to do and was very clear in his own mind how he was going to go about it. We speak about that a lot, having a plan for any situation you find yourself in and being clear with your thoughts. Don’t try and just bluff your way through it.”
