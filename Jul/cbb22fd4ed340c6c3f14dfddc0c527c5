The first images of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor at his christening have been released. Two pictures taken by fashion photographer Chris Allerton were issued on Saturday. A family photo inside the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sitting with their child alongside the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge. Standing behind them are the Prince of Wales, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, the Duke of Cambridge and the sisters of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale. A second shot in black-and-white shows Meghan dressed in white gazing into Harry’s eyes as she cradles baby Archie with the castle’s Rose Garden in the background.
