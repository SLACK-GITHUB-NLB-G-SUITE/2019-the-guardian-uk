“Holidaying alone is glorious.” So says Grace Dent (Weekend, 27 July) and so it is indeed! Why, therefore, does she spoil it all by feeling the need to tell us she has a partner, friends and a dying father? Does a woman holidaying on her own really need to justify herself in such a way? Last year I travelled for nine days down the San Juan river in remotest Nicaragua in order to meet the Rama tribe who live in a forested area by the Caribbean coast. Not one person asked me why I was travelling alone, but several asked if they could come with me, to which they received a resounding “No!”. I haven’t reached the great age of 72 years without feeling at liberty to do what I damn well like how I damn well like it.Margie MitchellLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
