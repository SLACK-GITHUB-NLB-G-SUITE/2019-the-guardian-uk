The England forward Toni Duggan has signed for Atlético Madrid Women, two months after she praised their fans for booing and abusing her when she played for Barcelona at the Wanda Metropolitano last season. Duggan left Barcelona at the end of the campaign after two seasons and has joined Atlético, who are aiming for a fourth consecutive league title, on a two-year contract. “I had several offers – from all around the world – but at this stage in my career I wanted to join a side that is consistently challenging for honours and Atletico’s record is incredible,” the 28-year-old said. “I’ve seen this team up close over the last couple of years and they are a real force. “When I visited the new training ground I was extremely impressed. In terms of a facility that caters specifically for a women’s team, it is the best I have ever seen.” Duggan was part of the Barcelona team that played in front of 60,000 fans at the Metropolitano in March. She said on Wednesday she had been “blown away by the atmosphere and their support for the team”. Before the Women’s World Cup she explained why it had been especially enjoyable. “The fans really wanted to be there for their team – the Atlético supporters were giving us stick, they were booing us, there were flares,” she said. “I’m not encouraging all of it – there are some things in the men’s game we don’t want – but I’m just saying it felt like a proper atmosphere.”
