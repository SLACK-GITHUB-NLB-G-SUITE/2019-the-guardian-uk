Paul Pogba is showing Manchester United “respect” despite the midfielder’s determination to force himself out of the club, according to his agent, Mino Raiola. The 26-year-old has stated he wants a new challenge and last week Raiola spoke of Pogba’s “willingness to move on”. This is despite Pogba, one of United’s highest-paid players, being contracted until 2021. “The player has done nothing wrong,” Raiola told TalkSport. “He has been respectful and professional in every way and always. The club has known his feeling for a long time.” Raiola also claimed that United should defend Pogba against criticism he is receiving for his desire to depart. “It is a shame other people only like to criticise without the right information, and I am also sorry that the club does not take any position against this,” he said. “Hopefully there will be soon a satisfying solution for all parties.” Pogba is with the United squad in Perth as the club start their pre-season tour. Ole Gunnar Solskjær is reportedly interested in Southampton’s 25-year-old midfielder Mario Lemina. Arsenal and Leicester are also monitoring the Gabonese, according to the Press Association, though no club have met the valuation. Southampton paid Juventus an initial €17m for Lemina two years ago and although he has made only three appearances since the turn of the year and the club are thought to want to recoup this.
