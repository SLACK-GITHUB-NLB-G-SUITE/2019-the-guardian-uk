Idrissa Gueye has completed his move from Everton to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee understood to be €32m (£29m). The midfielder has sealed the transfer on a contract to 2023 after Everton rejected a £21.5m offer from PSG in January. Marco Silva had hoped to keep Gueye at Goodison Park this season but the player was determined to join the French champions. “I wanted to give a new boost to my club career by joining Paris Saint-Germain, one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in Europe,” Gueye told his new club’s website. Everton have made a substantial profit on the 29-year-old Gueye, who signed from Aston Villa for £8m in 2016. The Senegal international played in France for Lille from 2008 to 2015. On Tuesday the Merseyside club also agreed a deal to sign the 19-year-old Juventus forward Moise Kean for an initial £29m, with the player due to fly to England on Wednesday to finalise the move. Everton have signed Fabian Delph and Jonas Lössl this summer and turned André Gomes’s loan from Barcelona into a permanent transfer. Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha remains a target for the club as they look to improve on their eighth-place finish in the Premier League last season.
