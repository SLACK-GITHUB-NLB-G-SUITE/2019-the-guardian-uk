Heather Watson’s hopes of matching her career-best performance at Wimbledon are over after she was outclassed by the 20th seed, Anett Kontaveit, on Court No 1. Watson has reached the third round three times at SW19 but despite a fast start against the Estonian her 10th consecutive Wimbledon campaign ends in round two. She broke service twice in the first set but she could not compete with Kontaveit once her opponent eventually found her groove, going down 7-5, 6-1. The 27-year-old Brit will be disappointed she could not capitalise on her impressive opening – not least because it was in direct contrast to her sluggish start in round one – but given she has just one win in the main draw of a full WTA Tour event since July it cannot be considered a major surprise. She needed a wild card to enter and while squeezed into the competition without one due to withdrawals, Watson was always going to be up against it when taking on Kontaveit. Twice in the opening five games Watson broke Kontaveit’s serve but the next two proved pivotal. Her opponent broke back immediately for 3-3 and eventually held for 4-3 despite considerable pressure from Watson. Serving to stay in the set at 5-4 down Watson did so comfortably but when attempting to do so again at 6-5 down she fell short. That seemed to break Watson’s spirit and Kontaveit wrapped up the second set 6-1 in just 27 minutes. It means Johanna Konta and Harriet Dart are the only Britons left in the women’s singles draw with six home players remaining in total.
