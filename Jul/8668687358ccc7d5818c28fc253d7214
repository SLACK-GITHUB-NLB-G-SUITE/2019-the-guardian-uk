The investment banker who was lined up to lead Santander before it suddenly withdrew the offer over his pay demands is suing the Spanish lender for €100m (£90m). Andrea Orcel submitted a lawsuit accusing Santander of a breach of contract, according to a report in the Financial Times , demanding the bank either hand him the sum in damages or reinstate its offer of the chief executive’s post. Santander offered Orcel the job last year but changed its mind in January, four months later, saying it could not justify paying him a €50m signing-on fee. The award was intended to compensate him for bonuses he would forfeit by leaving his job as president of the investment bank at Switzerland’s UBS. At the time, the bank said the compensation award was “a sum significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment”. “The board considers that for Santander to pay this amount to facilitating the hiring of one individual, even one of the calibre and background of Mr Orcel, would be unacceptable for a retail and commercial bank such as Santander,” it said. As well as concerns over pay, Orcel clashed with Santander’s executive chairman, Ana Botín, according to the FT, amid disagreement over what level of public profile he would be expected to have at the bank, the eurozone’s largest by market value. The bank’s change of heart meant José Antonio Álvarez remained in the role of chief executive, abandoning plans to transition to the chairman of Santander Spain in March. Orcel, known as a star investment banker at UBS, was due to receive an annual pay package in line with Alvarez, who earned €8.9m in 2017. In an interview with the FT earlier this year, Orcel said: “I’m not known to be a person that lets go, especially when I think the right thing to do is to not let go.” Orcel’s claim is believed to be based on a calculation of his lost earnings, as well as legal fees and other costs.
