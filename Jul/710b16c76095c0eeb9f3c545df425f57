As an 82-year-old, my hearing is no longer as acute as it was and I find myself needing subtitles (Lights, camera, caption!, G2, 22 July), particularly in order to cope with regional accents. But why am I able to clearly hear the dialogue of films and documentaries from the past? One wonders if there has been a change or decline in communication and projection.Dr David CarhartLondon • I always use subtitles when watching natural history films to avoid having to listen to the Hollywood blockbuster music or chase sequence themes more appropriate to Benny Hill films than some creature being predated. Unfortunately, it is not possible to avoid the anthropomorphic scripts but at least I don’t have to hear the hushed tones when something dies.Margaret V DarmodyWarwick • Liz Reason (Letters, 23 July) rightly objects to the inclusion of irrelevant details in reports about female politicians. May I also ask for the age of people not to be included unless it is relevant and also for an end to the weird practice of telling us what the accused was wearing in court?Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, France • My old burgundy passport cover was headed “European passport” in gold lettering. My renewal (just received) has a burgundy passport cover but this heading is omitted. Have we left already?Tony CrillySt Albans • Dave Brailsford says if the French won the Tour de France, “it would be a shot in the arm” for the sport (Report, 23 July). Er … has that not been the continuing occupational hazard for cycling? But bonne chance to Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot all the same.Professor Andrew WattersonStirling • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
