I had to admit a rueful smile as the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was forced to admit that “due to successive defence cuts the UK does not have the resources to defend shipping” (Analysis, 12 July). As we used to say in the Royal Navy, this might be termed a “BGO” – blinding glimpse of the obvious. Someone ought to explain to Mr Hunt, especially as he is the son of a distinguished admiral (on whose staff I served), that warships are not built overnight. They are not Airfix toys to be put together when it seems like a good idea. As an island nation, we have decimated the navy so it is no longer able to fulfil one of its prime purposes, which is as important today as it has been for centuries. Perhaps Mr Hunt still feels he is playing with toy ships in his bath.Commander Roger Paine RN (retired)Hellingly, East Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
