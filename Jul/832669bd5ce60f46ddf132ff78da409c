The world of women and sport is rapidly changing. The unprecedented coverage of both the Women’s football World Cup and the Netball World Cup have dictated this on an international platform. The rippling effect of the #thisgirlcan movement can still be felt almost five years on since it launched, the aim of which was to increase participation levels of girls and women in sport. In many scenarios, it is more than just a competitive game. It is a social space, where women can come together and set aside time for themselves. At club level, the sport spans across generations, with many women in their 30s and 40s returning to the sport of their youth. The ever-growing popularity of the sport prompted Sport England to award it a 16.9m government grant in 2017, 10.5m of which was set to encourage women to take up the sport again. Netball has always been at the forefront of this push. Often the first sport many young girls are introduced to, teaching important lessons such as teamwork, competition and integration, we want to hear your netball memories and experiences. Did you watch the Netball World Cup? What effect did it have on you and what do you remember from when you used to play?
