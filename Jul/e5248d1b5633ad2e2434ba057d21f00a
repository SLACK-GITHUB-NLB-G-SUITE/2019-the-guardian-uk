Paul Pogba was photographed at Manchester airport as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad left for Australia on Sunday afternoon to start their summer tour. The midfielder’s presence had been in doubt after his agent, Mino Raiola, said on Friday that the 26-year-old is trying to force his way out of the club. United named the Pogba in the squad and would have been shocked had he not been present on the tour, which is Solskjær’s first as the club’s manager. United play Perth Glory and Leeds in Perth, before Internazionale in Hong Kong and Tottenham in Shanghai. United are then in Oslo on 30 July to take on Solskjær’s hometown club, Kristiansund, before a trip to Cardiff for a final friendly against Milan on 3 August.
