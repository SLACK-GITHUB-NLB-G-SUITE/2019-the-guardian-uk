Tyson Fury has claimed that a highly-anticipated rematch with the WBC heavyweight champion, Deontay Wilder, has been signed to take place on 22 February next year. “The rematch has been confirmed and signed [for] 22 February. It’s on, the rematch,” Fury told the audience at a Q&A event at the Alhambra Theatre in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Fury’s first bout with Wilder in December was controversially scored as a draw, with many observers believing the British fighter deserved the win, despite being knocked down twice at the Staples Center. The 30-year-old has vowed not to let his rematch with Wilder go to the judges, instead aiming to win Wilder’s belt outright. “This time I am going to knock him the fuck out,” Fury said. This time I haven’t been out the ring for three years … I haven’t been abusing too much alcohol.” Wilder is currently scheduled to defend his belt in another return bout, against Luis Ortiz. Should he beat the Cuban again, he looks set for another showdown with Fury, who defeated Tom Schwarz inside two rounds in Las Vegas last month.
