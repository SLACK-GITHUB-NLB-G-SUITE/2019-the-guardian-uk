Danny Rose has been omitted from Tottenham’s party for their pre-season tour to Asia “to explore prospective opportunities with other clubs” as Mauricio Pochettino’s restructuring of his squad continues. The England full back now looks set to follow fellow defender Kieran Trippier in leaving Spurs just six weeks after the pair started in the Champions League final defeat to Liverpool in Madrid, with Rose left behind along with Vincent Janssen and Georges-Kévin Nkoudou for the tour of Singapore and Shanghai. The 29-year-old, who joined Tottenham from Leeds in 2007 and has made nearly 200 appearances for the club, still has two years left on the contract and is valued at around £25m by Spurs. It is unclear at this stage whether any move is close, although potential suitors in the past such as Everton and Manchester United are unlikely to enter the race given they are well covered in the left-back position. Rose rejected the chance to move to Schalke on loan at the start of last season but could be tempted to follow Trippier in going overseas. Young prospects Troy Parrott, Brooklyn Lyons-Foster, Harvey White, Alfie Whiteman, Japhet Tanganga, Jack Roles and Jamie Bowden are among the 25-man squad who will face Juventus and Manchester United over the next week. “Ben Davies, Eric Dier and Cameron Carter-Vickers will continue their rehabilitation at Hotspur Way,” said a statement on the official Tottenham website. “Vincent Janssen, Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and Danny Rose have been granted additional time off in order to explore prospective opportunities with other clubs. Serge Aurier, Davinson Sánchez and Victor Wanyama will return to Enfield to start pre-season training next week following commitments with their national teams at summer tournaments.”
