Arsenal are preparing to announce Nicolas Pépé as their record signing after agreeing personal terms with the Lille forward on a five-year contract. The Premier League club are to pay €80m (£72m) plus add-ons for the Ivory Coast international. Once the final details are settled and a medical taken, Arsenal expect to confirm Pépé’s arrival. Napoli were among other clubs who had hoped to buy the 24-year-old, who is left-footed but prefers to play on the right side of a front three. Pépé scored 22 goals in the French league last season, second to Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé, and provided 11 assists. Arsenal’s record fee is the £56m paid to buy Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018.
