Now that he is available at around 10-1, it is quite tempting to take a chance on Ten Sovereigns in the July Cup, the feature race on a hectic day’s action. He had a huge reputation just three months ago, after all, but his Royal Ascot effort still looks disappointing. Advertise (4.40) is a convincing favourite in light of his Commonwealth Cup success and he is taken to follow up here, as Muhaarar did four years ago. His stable was out of form when he threw in his only poor run and he can hold off the interesting Fairyland. 1.45 Ascot Just 3lb higher for winning what looked a decent contest at Windsor three weeks ago, Open Wide can go in again. He went close after trouble in running over this course and distance in the autumn. 2.05 York For course form, it is hard to beat Copper Knight, whose three wins at this trip here include big-field handicaps in May and October. He looks ready for this return to Listed company. 2.20 Newmarket Frankie Dettori gets his first ride on Honest Albert, unbeaten in two novice races. The chestnut looks generously treated on the strength of his most recent success. 2.40 York A Royal Ascot winner under another name before moving to Hong Kong, Gold Mount was an impressive Listed winner on his return here last month. The ground is quicker this time but he seemed to cope well with fast surfaces at Happy Valley and Sha Tin. 2.55 Newmarket Charlie Appleby has taken a shine to the Superlative Stakes, which he has won twice in the past three years. King’s Command, his runner this time, comes here after a similar preparation to last year’s winner, Quorto. 3.15 York This tricky small-field contest could fall to Escobar, who returned from a break in fine form when second at Sandown last weekend. 3.30 Newmarket Having snuck in at the foot of the weights, Zap could be worth a look at big odds. He won the consolation race for the Bunbury Cup last year but is 3lb lower now. His preparation has been similarly underwhelming but excuses can be made and a visor is tried. 3.50 York Twice successful in the John Smith’s Cup since 2011, William Haggas may have put together another winning plan with the lightly raced My Lord And Master. He was beaten just a neck here in October under the useful claiming jockey who rides again, and is actually 1lb lower, a mark which may have been protected with this in mind. 4.00 Ascot He has not been able to land a Group One yet but Beat The Bank is a monster at Group Two level and could bag his fifth such prize here. He was beaten just a neck in the Queen Anne when last seen and should prove too good for Zaaki, though his stable form could be stronger.
