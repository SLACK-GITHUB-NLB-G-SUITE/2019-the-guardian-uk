Warren Buffett is donating roughly $3.6bn of Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the biggest contribution in Buffett’s plan to give away his fortune. Berkshire said Buffett’s 14th annual donation comprises about 16.81m class B shares of Berkshire. The donation will boost the total amount Buffett has given to the charities to more than $34.5bn since the 88-year-old billionaire pledged in 2006 to give his shares away. Four-fifths of the donations go to the Gates Foundation. The rest goes to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett’s late first wife, and charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. Buffett has since 1965 built Berkshire into a roughly $522bn conglomerate owning such businesses as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice-cream, and stocks such as Apple and Wells Fargo. Buffett’s largest previous annual donation was $3.4bn in 2018. Following the latest donation, Buffett will still own about 15.7% of Berkshire, despite having given away 45% of his 2006 holdings, and have roughly 31% of its voting power. Buffett remains the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $87.5bn according to Forbes magazine. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, and his family topped Forbes’s list at $157.8bn. Berkshire invested in Amazon for the first time early this year. The Gates and family charities typically sell Buffett’s shares to finance their activities, reflecting his desire that money be spent. Buffett also donates to other charities.
