Ole Gunnar Solskjær believes only a “small minority” of Manchester United fans are unhappy with Paul Pogba due to his wish to leave the club. The Frenchman wants a new challenge three years after returning to Old Trafford yet he currently appears unlikely to depart. This means Pogba should again be central to Solskjær plans this coming season. Solskjær insists he does not have any concerns over how the midfielder will be greeted when United face Chelsea at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the campaign. “No [concerns],” he said. “Of course, there will be a small minority [of naysayers]. Me and the players will testify he’s not been a problem. We’re just grateful when he performs as he does.” Pogba is part of the United squad that will play its fourth pre-season match in Thursday’s International Champions Cup meeting with Tottenham Hotspur in Shanghai. Solskjaer also has new signings, Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, integrating with the side during the tour. The Norwegian is also targeting Leicester City’s Harry Maguire and Sporting Lisbon’s Bruno Fernandes, with just over two weeks left of the transfer window. Should no further signings arrive, Solskjær insists he is content with the squad that would be at his disposal. “I believe in these players,” he said. “I’m sure we could do well [without]. We’ve played well and had some good results in pre-season but it’s also about finding the way we want to play and get the team gelling. “We’ve got to be patient. It’s very important we get the right ones [new players]. I’ve not had a frustrating feeling at all.”
