You might not want to admit it, but emojis are 💯. That is, they are very good. Far from being, as their detractors claim, representations of an infantile – or senile – lack of written language skills, the iconography born of Japanese text messages in the 1990s is increasingly crucial to clear communication online, as well as adding yet another rich vein to the inventive history of English prose. Let’s start at the top. Emojis help convey tone in text conversations that sometimes sorely lack this. “Come here please 😠” is very different from “come here please 😍”. “I loved it ☺️” conveys sincerity, while “I loved it 🙄” implies a sarcastic affectation. Regardless of the aesthetic considerations, using emojis to communicate tone is certainly preferable to previous attempts, such as the attempt in 2010 to copyright the “sarcmark”, a new punctuation mark to denote sarcasm (for the low price of $1.99). Fantastic idea 🙄. 'Come over for some 🍆' is not a good thing to text someone if you’re cooking aubergine parmigiana The ability of emojis to communicate tone is more than just a matter of literacy with this new communication method. According to a new paper in the journal Behaviour and Information Technology, “the use of emoji faces in computer-mediated communication produces neural responses that are similar to those that are observed in face-to-face communication.” Seeing a happy face while talking to someone affects us on an emotional level, and it doesn’t seem to matter a whole lot whether that face is on a person or on a screen. Fantastic! 😀 That clarity means that emojis have a real role to play in corporate settings, argued Christopher Mims in the Wall Street Journal. “It’s happening for deep neurological reasons,” he said, citing the BIT paper, “and can lead to better cooperation.” But emojis are so much more than a set of clarifying marks. Over the years, the icons have been imbued with a set of alternative meanings, born of allegory, context and cultural associations. All of which is to say that “do you want to come over for some 🍆” is no longer a good thing to text someone if you’re cooking aubergine parmigiana. That ambiguity can cause more problems than simple embarrassment. In February, the Verge reported on a growing number of tricky court cases where deciphering the exact meaning of a vague emoji has become critical to a prosecution. “Teamwork make [sic] the dream work 👠💰”, read one text submitted as evidence in a case over prostitution. Did the money bag imply a working relationship? Or simply a romantic one? Not all ambiguity is deliberate, either. Because of the way emojis are created – approved by a non-profit organisation, the Unicode Consortium, but then drawn by individual companies including Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Google – the same icon can look very different when sent across platforms. The “shallow pot of food” emoji 🥘 is a paella for Google and Microsoft, but a stew for Apple and Samsung, for instance, which could confuse your dinner guests – but at least it’s not as bad as the two-year period when a pistol 🔫 was a water gun on iPhones and a real one on Android. As emojis grow in importance, that sort of problem will fade, to be replaced by a new one: corporate capture. Last week, Unicode approved a new pickup truck emoji, one of a number that will make it on to phones in 2020. That same day, Ford proudly revealed that it had essentially tricked the non-profit into doing so. It had first pitched the emoji in 2015 and was shot down, so last summer it worked with a marketing firm and creative agency to submit the successful proposal. Those agencies didn’t disclose their involvement with the car company, something that rankled Jennifer 8. Lee, the vice chair of the Unicode emoji subcommittee. “Some transparency would be nice,” she told the Atlantic. Lee may have been being sarcastic, but we can never know for sure: her remarks were not quoted alongside an emoji. • Alex Hern is the UK technology editor for the Guardian
