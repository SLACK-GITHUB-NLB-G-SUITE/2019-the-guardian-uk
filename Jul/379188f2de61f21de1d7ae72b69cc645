Liverpool expect Naby Keïta to take part in their pre-season tour of the US this month despite aggravating the injury that curtailed his debut campaign at Anfield. The Guinea midfielder has withdrawn from the Africa Cup of Nations following a recurrence of an adductor injury in the defeat by Nigeria last week. Keïta was forced to miss Guinea’s final group game against Burundi and will also be absent from the last-16 tie against Algeria on Friday. Liverpool’s £52.75m midfielder ruptured his adductor in the Champions League semi-final first leg in Barcelona on 1 May and did not feature again for Jürgen Klopp’s side in a debut season interrupted by injury problems. However, having been assessed by the club’s medical staff this week, Liverpool do not expect the 24-year-old to be out of action for another lengthy period. Keïta has been told to take a holiday before reporting as planned for the US tour that involves matches against Borussia Dortmund in Indiana, Sevilla in Boston and Sporting in New York.
