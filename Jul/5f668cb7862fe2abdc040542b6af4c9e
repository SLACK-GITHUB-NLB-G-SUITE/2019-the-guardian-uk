Indonesia’s parliament has unanimously approved an amnesty for a woman who was jailed for documenting sexual harassment by her employer. Baiq Nuril Maknun, 37, who worked at a school on the island of Lombok, recorded a telephone conversation with the headteacher, whom she accused of making repeated unwanted sexual advances. A colleague used the audio to lodge an official complaint against the man. The supreme court in Jakarta convicted Maknun of recording and spreading indecent material under the country’s electronic information and transactions law. She was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 500m rupiah (£26,400) after overturning a 2017 acquittal from a lower court. The case attracted international attention, with human rights groups pledging to support Maknun’s fight for justice. The president, Joko Widodo, recommended amnesty after Maknun had exhausted all other legal avenues. On Wednesday, lawmakers applauded as Maknun’s reprieve was announced. She wept as she told parliament: “Don’t let anyone else have an experience like mine. It hurt so much, I hope there won’t be any more victims, and women should dare to speak up.” The case has renewed focus on the treatment of women in Indonesia, a conservative country that tolerates child marriage, has high levels of violence against women and imposes virginity tests on women who want to join the military or police.
