Ole Gunnar Solskjær has warned Paul Pogba and other players who wish to leave that Manchester United will not be forced to sell. The manager’s stance signals that Pogba may have to put in a transfer request if he is to get a move. The midfielder has spoken of wanting a “new challenge”. His agent, Mino Raiola, has stated that everyone at United knows the Frenchman sees his future elsewhere. Real Madrid are interested in signing the 26-year-old but Solskjær was firm regarding United’s position, while speaking in Perth at the start of a pre-season tour. “As far as I am aware and up to now, we don’t have any bids for any of our players,” he said. “We are Man United – we don’t have to sell players. Agents talk all the time. Paul is a top bloke, a great professional. He has never put himself out of the team. He has always wanted to play and he always gives his best. “There has been loads of talk and speculation, of course, about all our players or many of our players, both ins and outs. For me, it’s business as usual. When you’re Man United, you expect all these things to pop up in the summer. “And of course I’ve been in touch with Paul, spoken to Paul. Spoken to Rom [Romelu Lukaku], spoken to Rashy [Marcus Rashford], Jesse [Lingard] – I’ve spoken to all the players, more or less, over the summer. As you do, you keep in touch with them.” Solskjær is optimistic that David de Gea will sign a fresh contract, the goalkeeper’s current terms ending in just under 12 months. “David’s had a summer now where he’s been negotiating and thinking about his contract, so we hope that we’re going to get it sorted soon,” he said. “I’m positive. Of course, with David, I’ve said many a time how lucky I am, and how happy we are, to have him in the goal. So we hope he stays here for many years.”
