Everton have made an inquiry about signing Moise Kean from Juventus, who are willing to sell the forward for €40m (£35.7m) if a buy-back clause is inserted. Everton sold Ademola Lookman to RB Leipzig for an undisclosed fee on Thursday and would like to make Kean, a 19-year-old Italy international, a marquee summer signing. The clubs are due to open talks to establish whether a deal can be struck. Juventus’s asking price is higher than Everton want to pay and the Premier League club have reservations regarding a buy-back arrangement. Juventus want that set at around €60m. Kean has one year remaining on his contract and will likely sign a new deal if he stays at Juventus because relations between the club and his agent, Mino Raiola, are strong. The player scored six Serie A goals in 13 appearances last season and has played three times for Italy. Lookman’s departure comes after he spent time on loan at Leipzig last year. He joined Everton from Charlton in 2017 but has been unable to hold down a first-team place.
