Darcey Bussell will be replaced when she steps down as a Strictly Come Dancing judge by Motsi Mabuse, elder sister of Oti, who dances on the show. The 38-year-old has past form as both a dancer and a judge, having won the South African and German Latin championships in 2009 and 2010 consecutively, and having served on the judging panel of Let’s Dance in Germany since 2011. In a post to fans on social media, Mabuse quoted from the Erin Hanson poem the words “There is freedom waiting for you, on the breezes of the sky, and you ask, ‘What if I fall?’ Oh, but my darling, what if you fly?” In a statement, Mabuse said she was “overyjoyed” to be joining the judges Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas on the panel. She said: “I have so much respect and admiration for the other three judges and hope to add my own bit of sparkle to the show. I can’t wait to get started!” Charlotte Moore, BBC’s director of content, said: “Motsi is a brilliant addition to the show. She is a wonderful dancer in her own right and already has years of experience as a judge under her belt. We’re all looking forward to welcoming her to the Strictly family.” Sarah James, executive producer of Strictly, said: “I am incredibly excited that Motsi Mabuse is joining the show. Motsi’s natural warmth, energy and passion for dance makes her the perfect addition to our esteemed judging panel.” Mabuse will replace Bussell when the show returns in the autumn. Bussell had been a judge intermittently on the show since 2009. The former ballerina announced she was leaving the show in April. At the time, Bussell said: “It has been a complete privilege for me to be part of Strictly, working with such a talented team. I have enjoyed every minute of my time and will miss everyone from my fellow judges, the presenters, the dancers, the musicians, the entire back stage team, and especially the viewers of the show, who have been so supportive.”
