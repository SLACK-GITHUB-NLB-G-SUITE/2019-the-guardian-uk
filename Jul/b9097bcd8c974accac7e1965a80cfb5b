The International Trade Union Confederation’s latest report shows the shocking extent of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. Thirty-four trade unionists were murdered in 2018 – almost two-thirds of worldwide cases. This is more than double the previous year’s tally of 15 murders, which even then made Colombia the most dangerous country for labour organising. The violence has continued into 2019, with 10 members of the Fensuagro agricultural union killed this year, and 30 since late 2016. Thirteen teachers were also killed in 2018 amid nationwide strike action over conditions and pay. In 2018, Colombia was invited to join the OECD, formed of the world’s richest countries, even though it clearly violates established standards of labour rights and conditions. Anti-union violence is a major contributor to Colombia’s abysmal labour rights record. Protecting trade unionists therefore will not only save lives but improve conditions for millions of working people. Violence against civil society has continued despite the 2016 peace agreement between the state and the Farc to end decades of armed conflict. Colombia faces a human rights catastrophe, with more than 500 social activists and 135 Farc former guerrillas killed since the deal was signed. The UN says the agreement is vital for tackling violence, and reminded the government of its obligations to the peace process. The international community must demand that Colombia guarantee security for trade unionists and activists. We also urge Colombia’s government to fully implement the peace agreement.Senator Paul Gavan Sinn FeinDan Carden MPLabour, Liverpool WaltonJo Stevens MPLabour, Cardiff CentralTony Lloyd MPLabour, RochdaleHelen Goodman MP Labour, Bishop AucklandClive Efford MPLabour, ElthamCouncillor Philippa MarsdenLabour, CaerphillyCouncillor Ian ByrneLabour, EvertonCouncillor Linda PerksLabour, GreenwichSteve CavalierThompsons Solicitors chief executiveFrances O’GradyTUC general secretaryLen McCluskeyUnite general secretaryDave Prentis Unison general secretaryKevin CallinanFórsa senior general secretaryChris Keates NASUWT general secretaryDave WardCWU general secretaryClaire SullivanCSP director of employment relations and union servicesTim RoacheGMB general secretaryHorace TrubridgeMU general secretaryKevin CourtneyNEU joint general secretaryGrahame SmithSTUC general secretaryMick CashRMT general secretaryManuel CortesTSSA general secretaryTony WoodhouseUnite chairChristine BlowerNEU international secretaryPaddy LillisUsdaw general secretaryDave ToddPOA vice-chairJoe SimpsonPOA deputy general secretaryMick WhelanAslef general secretaryEoin RonayneForsá Senior general secretary designateAnne SpeedUnison Northern Ireland head of bargaining and representationCarl MadanCWU national executive council • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
