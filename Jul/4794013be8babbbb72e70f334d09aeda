Dan Evans and Harriet Dart led the home charge early on Tuesday as both booked their places in the second round at Wimbledon. Evans was commanding in his straight sets victory over Federico Delbonis while Dart battled back from a set down to beat the American lucky loser Christina McHale 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in front of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, who appeared in the Court 14 crowd before taking her place in the royal box. Evans swept aside the Argentinian left-hander Delbonis 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 to continue his fine recent form, following Challenger title wins in Surbiton and Nottingham. He would have been expected to overcome Delbonis, who has never won a match at Wimbledon, but his tale of redemption continues apace with this professional victory. He was denied a wild card 12 months ago after his year-long ban for testing positive for cocaine in 2017 and failed to qualify but he has fought back to No 61 in the world. He began in fine style, holding serve then breaking immediately before claiming the opening set 6-3. His style is well suited to grass and on more than one occasion a cross-court backhand volley brought gasps from the crowd on Court No 18. Delbonis was a tougher nut to crack in the second set which featured no breaks and while Evans had a brief wobble in the tie-break, allowing a 6-1 lead to dwindle to 6-5, he clinched the set with the next point before confidently seeing out the third. Dart meanwhile, won a gruelling contest with McHale in two hours and 19 minutes. McHale took the first set 6-4 but Dart hit back to take the second and edged a topsy-turvy decider that featured seven breaks of serve.
