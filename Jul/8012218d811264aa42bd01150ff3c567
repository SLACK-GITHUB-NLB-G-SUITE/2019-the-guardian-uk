As a hairy monster swells towards me in its knotted web, it’s unclear whether we’re being cooked dinner or cooked for dinner. I reach into its cocoon and find a bowl of twig-like food that looks as if it’s been shaved from its prickly antenna. It’s OK; we’re off tonight’s menu. Gingerline’s immersive dining experience, Chambers_, is an evening of shambolic fun. In a secret location in east London, the audience are culinary cartographers travelling across multiple dimensions. We crawl through a series of tiny rooms transformed into new worlds where we’re fed, told stories and set tasks by lost boys, arachnid monsters and gelatinous aliens. The design by Stripeland is exquisite, from the wriggling neon lights of a larval lair to the full filing cabinets of a dystopian surveillance bunker. Some rooms feel more cared-for than others – one is reminiscent of a toddler’s toy oven – but each open door feels like falling further down the rabbit hole. While the set thrills, the script babies, and the panto performances are too big for the tiny spaces. A vague subplot of an evil intruder pulls us towards the centre of the multiverse, but lends itself more to the creation of a spooky soundtrack and moody lighting than the formation of a proper story. The food itself varies in quality and bears little relation to the worlds we are in. It is rarely savoured over, rather chucked down before we head on. The real pleasure of a Gingerline experience is in its surprises. This is a show to see with friends, as half the fun is watching them embarrass themselves. Though inconsequential and nonsensical at every turn, Chambers is nevertheless a joyful piece of escapism. • Chambers is booking until September, at https://www.gingerline.co.uk/
