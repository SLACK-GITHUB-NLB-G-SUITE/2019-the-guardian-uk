Gareth Bale sees no way out of Real Madrid after the collapse of his move to China, with the forward concluding that Florentino Pérez, the president, could not care less that Zinedine Zidane does not want to play him. Bale had been set to move to Jiangsu Suning, yet three days before the Chinese Super League’s transfer window closes on Wednesday, Pérez decided against the move and Bale believes it is dead. This has left Bale at odds with Pérez and is understood to have no interest in a move to another club in Europe, permanently or on loan. The 30-year-old faces a bleak future at Real Madrid and believes he has little prospect of being selected, given Zidane’s recent pronouncements that he wants the Welshman to leave. Jiangsu have signed the Croatia striker Ivan Santini from Anderlecht, leaving them with five foreign players. Chinese Super League rules allow four overseas-born players in a squad and the Italian defender Gabriel Paletta is expected to depart soon.
