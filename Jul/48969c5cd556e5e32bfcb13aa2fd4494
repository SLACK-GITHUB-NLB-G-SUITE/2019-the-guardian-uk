Manchester City finally boarded the flight to China for their summer tour on Monday morning following a two-day wait due to an “administrative error” that Thomas Cook Sport blamed on third parties. City had been scheduled to fly Shanghai early on Saturday evening but this was postponed at the last moment, with club staff already at Manchester Airport. While City are unhappy with Thomas Cook Sport, the travel company played down any culpability. A Thomas Cook Sport spokesman said: “Due to an administrative error with third parties, Manchester City’s flight with Aeronexus was delayed by two days. We have resolved this issue and the team are due to depart today at 11am.” The issue may relate to a failure to gain clearance into Chinese airspace. Despite the frustration Pep Guardiola and his squad are understood to be relaxed about losing 48 hours of the pre-season trip with training having taken place at the City Football Academy, and the manager posing with fans for photographs at the airport on Monday before the flight. Guardiola’s 26-man squad does not include Sergio Agüero, Fernandinho, Gabriel Jesus, and Ederson, due to participation in the Copa América. Riyad Mahrez is absent due to playing for Algeria in Africa Cup of Nations. While Phil Foden will join-up with the tour in Hong Kong, Guardiola has included 12 academy-reared players in the group. City are due to meet West Ham United in Nangjing before meeting either Newcastle United or Wolverhampton Wanders in Shanghai before flying to Hong Kong for a third friendly with Kitchee ahead of a moving to Japan for the final game, against City’s sister club, Yokohama F Marinos.
