Police in Southlake, Texas, responded to reports of an unconscious man in a hotel room on Monday morning. Skaggs was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. “It is with great sorrow that we report Tyler Skaggs passed away earlier today in Texas,” an Angels statement said. “Tyler has, and always will be, an important part of the Angels Family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Carli and his entire family during this devastating time.” Angels statement on the passing of Tyler Skaggs. pic.twitter.com/6XA2Vu1uWV Skaggs, who was from the Los Angeles area, was selected by the Angels in the first-round of the 2009 draft. He was later traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks but rejoined the Angels in 2013. He was having one of the best seasons of his career in 2019 and was part of the team’s starting rotation. Skaggs was picked by the Angels in the same draft as his teammate Mike Trout. Trout paid tribute to Skaggs in a tweet on Monday evening. “Words cannot express the deep sadness we feel right now,” wrote Trout. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Carli and their families. Remembering him as a great teammate, friend, and person who will forever remain in our hearts... we love you, 45.” Words cannot express the deep sadness we feel right now.
