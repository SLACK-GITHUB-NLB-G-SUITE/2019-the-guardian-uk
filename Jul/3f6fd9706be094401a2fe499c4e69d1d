Everton have sent Wilfried Zaha a DVD of their glorious Champions League campaign in 2005 in the hope of convincing the Crystal Palace winger that they are just as big as Arsenal. Marco Silva’s side are ready to offer £60m plus Cenk Tosun for Zaha – but their plans might be scuppered if Chelsea look to muscle in by arranging a deal with Palace that would see the 26-year-old join them once their transfer ban is over. Hear that? Yep, it’s the sound of evil laughter emanating from Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile, circus music continues to blare out of Old Trafford as Manchester United attempt to complete a deal for Harry Maguire. Ole Gunnar Solskjær wants United to pull their finger out and meet Leicester’s £80m asking price for Maguire immediately after losing Eric Bailly to a knee injury. Over to Ed Woodward, who’ll get right on the case as soon as he recovers from the shock of hearing that Newcastle want £30m for Sean Longstaff. United will move for Lyon’s Moussa Dembélé if Romelu Lukaku joins Internazionale and are also said to be have identified Lazio’s Sergej Milinkovic-Savic as a replacement for Paul Pogba, who continues to be linked with Juventus. Milinkovic-Savic will cost £60m, but United will only sign him if Pogba leaves. Carlo Ancelotti always goes weak at the knees for a mercurial No10 – and the Napoli manager wants James Rodríguez from Real Madrid. Napoli are also in for Lille’s Nicolas Pépé. They are willing to offer £73m plus Adam Ounas for the Lille striker. Borussia Dortmund are trying to sign Malcom from Barcelona for £37.5m. Malcolm is one of several players Barcelona are willing to offload to fund a move for Neymar, with Philippe Coutinho available for £120m and Ivan Rakitic a target for United and PSG.
