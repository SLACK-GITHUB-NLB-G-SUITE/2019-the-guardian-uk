A security guard has been found dead in his tent at Glastonbury festival, police say. The man in his 60s was discovered at 5pm on Sunday. He had been working on the site but is not believed to have worked in the 24 hours before his death. He is not believed to have collapsed because of the heat. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset police said it had been made aware of the sudden death of a man at one of the festival campsites. “Officers attended and are satisfied the man’s death is not suspicious. The coroner has been informed,” they added. The man worked for G4S, which provided 25 on-site security guards. He had been working night shifts over the weekend and the firm offered its condolences to his family. A G4S spokesman added: “The next of kin have been informed and our thoughts are with his loved ones at this difficult time.”
