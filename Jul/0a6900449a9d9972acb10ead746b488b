You may have gone with the whole family to a brilliant site on a bus route or close to a railway station, or arrived at a major terminus in Europe and boarded a tram to a municipal camping ground. Of course, it’s not only the mode of transport and convenience of the location that’s important; the quality of the campsite matters, too, so tell us about its setting, facilities and cafes. Send tips from all parts of the UK and Europe, including transport details, exact locations, websites and prices. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 16 July 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here. Read the terms and conditions
