Regular Money readers may remember the appalling case of Nicola Eldridge, whose 2018 trip to Greece was halted when easyJet cancelled her family’s air tickets without telling them – not once, but twice. The second time was at 3am on the morning they were due to fly. The family only learned this at the airport gate, and the holiday was over before it had begun. At the time the airline claimed it was because her bank cards had been used fraudulently, though it never substantiated this. Guardian Money advised Eldridge to use the flight lawyers Bott and Co to demand the compensation for denied boarding due as per the EU rules. Last month at a court hearing, a judge agreed that the claimants had been denied boarding against their will and therefore awarded them compensation and their expenses in full. At the time, easyJet said it would “always pay compensation when it is due”, but it fought this claim all the way. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
