Shane O’Mara’s theories (This brain was made for walking, G2, 29 July) could do wonders for the recruitment of city-dwelling Lib Dem Focus deliverers. When I decided to opt for a third term on the city council in 2018, I said to colleagues, “My legs are fine, so hopefully my brain is fit for purpose”. I held my seat by walking hundreds of miles all year round. Walking city streets is not empty time. Inside the brain meetings can be planned, next Sunday’s sermon can be edited, decisions about evening meals can be made – all while sticking bits of paper through letterboxes and observing the state of the streets. Talking to real people along the way is a bonus. And the 72-year-old legs, for which I buy a new pair of industrial boots each year (cheaper than gym membership), seem to be doing OK.Geoff ReidBradford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
