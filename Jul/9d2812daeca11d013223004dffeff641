As an academic who has researched marching band traditions in Northern Ireland, I must point out that, contrary to Ewan Murray’s article (Portrush Orange parade gives the Open an embarrassing problem, 3 July), there will be no Orange parade in Portrush. The event is a band parade with which the Orange Order has no connection and will play no part. There will be no Orange sashes, no bonfires or effigies of the pope. The parade does not commemorate the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed it does not commemorate anything: it is an annual fundraising and social event. Murray is correct that American spectators will be intrigued: probably they will also be delighted by a range of fine musical ensembles, many of which have won awards within and beyond Northern Ireland, playing everything from marches and pop songs to Irish jigs and Scottish hornpipes in a variety of styles. But what, asks Murray, will fans from the Republic of Ireland make of it? Well, probably they will enjoy the music like everybody else – after all, at least two of these ensembles have performed in the republic more than once in the past. In fact, the only person who seems to have a “problem” is Mr Murray, and the only thing “comedic”, “ludicrous” and “embarrassing” is his stereotypical snobbery regarding an art form produced by working-class people for working-class people. It’s the kind of thing that gets golf a bad name.Dr Gordon RamseyBelfast
