A court in Cyprus has remanded 12 Israeli youths in custody on suspicion of the alleged rape of a 19-year-old British tourist at a holiday resort on the island. The youths, aged between 16 and 18, are alleged to have raped the woman in a hotel room in Ayia Napa, a resort on the south-eastern coast. The woman told police the assault happened on Wednesday morning in her hotel room. Medical examiners said they found bruises and scratches on the woman. The suspects, who were also on holiday in Ayia Napa, have not been charged. They were brought before a district court in the town of Paralimni on Thursday where a magistrate remanded them in custody for eight days pending completion of inquiries. In accordance with Cypriot law on rape cases and because some of the suspects are minors, the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors. The suspects covered their faces with their T-shirts as they were being escorted in and out of the court building.
