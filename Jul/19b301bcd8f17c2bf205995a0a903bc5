Adam Peaty added to his medal haul at the the world championships in Gwangju, South Korea by winning gold in the 50m breaststroke. Peaty had already topped the podium in the 100m on Monday and claimed his third 50-100m double at the world championships with a time of 26.06. He finished 0.6 of a second faster than Felipe Lima, while Joao Gomes took bronze in 26.69. The 24-year-old will have been hoping to beat his own 50m world record of 25.95secs – which he set in 2017 in Budapest – but fell just short. Peaty, who won Great Britain’s first gold medal at the Rio Olympics three years ago, is unbeaten in five years at the breaststroke.
