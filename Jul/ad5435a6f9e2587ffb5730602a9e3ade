I can think of many things “more depressing than a chef home-making baked beans when Heinz exist” (Yes you can: stop tinned food snobbery, G2, 10 July). My version of baked beans contains no salt, the only fat is olive oil for sauteing onions, and there is very little sugar. I do use some molasses, or treacle, to give more flavour. I appreciate not everyone wants to or can make their own, but why despise a healthier, tastier version? That’s a form of snobbery in itself.Jill BennettSt Albans, Hertfordshire • Every time you mention Tommy Robinson, you add “whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon” (Robinson jailed for contempt of court as his far-right supporters clash with police, 12 July). Just call him by his real name – we know who he is.Dominic TaylorLondon • Why can’t air travel be rationed to a sustainable level (Don’t panic! We’re doing our bit on climate crisis, Letters, 13 July)? If the equivalent of ration books were issued, then those of us who have no wish to fly could sell our air miles to those who do.Sue StephensonBarrow upon Humber, Lincolnshire • As well as toilet paper (Letters, 15 July), Izal produced disinfectant. The toilet paper also supplied reading material, as every few sheets there was a short poem. I still remember: “As well as being antiseptic, germicidal, healing / Izal in the bath gives an exhilarating feeling”.Betty McCathie LoweMarlow, Buckinghamshire • “Day one in a week-long series casting new light on would-be PM” (The real Boris Johnson, 15 July)? Talk about closing barn doors, and bolting horses.Owen RossanLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
