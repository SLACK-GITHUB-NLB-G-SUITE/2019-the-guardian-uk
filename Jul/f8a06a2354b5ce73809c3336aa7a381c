Running with someone can give you that boost to get moving. Commit to a person and a time, and agree in advance that there’ll be no backing out. Before you start, discuss pace, route and whether or not you’re sticking together, so you’re both happy. Running with a partner makes exercise a shared experience. Switch off and have a good chat (in breaks if not while jogging). It’s a chance to talk about your feelings and relieve tension. In the winter months, when it gets darker earlier, running in a pair means you can look out for each other – and you’re less likely to be approached if you’re with someone else. On solo runs, it’s easy to say to yourself: “I don’t need to do that extra kilometre”; if you exercise with another person, there is nowhere to hide. Pick a partner who is slightly faster or more experienced than you and you’ll have a ready-made running coach who will keep you striving for better form. •Stephen Macconville is the fitness lead at nuffieldhealth.com.
