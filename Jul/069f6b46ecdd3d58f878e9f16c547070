Carol Jackson was the resources director and the deputy chief executive at the Refugee Council when I was its chief executive. She really was the best deputy you could wish for â€“ the sort of co-leader you need by your side when running a challenging organisation doing vital work. At the time when the charity was faced with a massive cut in funding, it was thanks to Carol that we survived. She faced each new challenge with aplomb, never getting flustered even when she had to step in and lead the bulk of the redundancy consultations after another senior colleague fell ill.
