Australia completed a predictable series sweep of Japan, winning the second and final rugby Test by an emphatic margin in Sydney. The Wallaroos backed up their 34-5 victory in Newcastle last weekend by not conceding a try before running out 46-3 winners at North Sydney Oval on Friday night. Australia ran in sevens tries to secure their first series win on home soil. Captain and No 8 Grace Hamilton notched a hat-trick and clocked up an impressive 204 run metres to claim her second successive player of the match award. Australia dominated their opponents from the outset, though the Japanese battled gamely throughout. The Wallaroos scored four first half tries before the Japanese enjoyed their best period of the match by keeping their hosts scoreless from halftime until the hour-mark. Japan went close to scoring while winger Lori Cramer was in the sinbin for a shoulder charge but once Australia added impact off the benchÂ they skipped clear in the final quarter.
