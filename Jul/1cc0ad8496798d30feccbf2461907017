The Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, has backed Ravel Morrison “to get back to the level he wants to be” after confirming the signing of the former Manchester United midfielder on a one-year contract. Morrison, who spent last season at the Swedish side Östersund, has been on trial with the newly promoted side in Portugal this week and will now form part of Wilder’s squad for the new season after agreeing the deal, which also has an option to extend it should he prove successful. 📽️ Ravel Morrison gives his first interview as a Sheffield United player.➡️ https://t.co/YPF5ckpvNS#SUFC 🔴 “Ravel is an undoubted talent and we are delighted that we have put together a deal that suits all parties,” said Wilder. “I’ve spoken to a number of people about him and it is clear that he has serious ability. We are getting a fantastic footballer with a tremendous pedigree and this is a great opportunity for Rav, we believe we can help him get back to the level he wants to be. “He’s done extremely well during his time with us and it was great to have him in Portugal. It wasn’t about him coming and being on trial because we knew about his abilities. Taking him with us was basically getting to know him and what he’s about, what makes him tick and how he integrates with the players. Trips like what we have been on are invaluable for that.” The 26-year-old becomes United’s fourth signing of the summer after the arrivals of Luke Freeman, Phil Jagielka and Callum Robinson. Morrison last played in the Premier League in 2014 for West Ham and has since spent time on loan at Birmingham, QPR and Cardiff before moving to Lazio in 2015. “He’s done extremely well during his time with us and it was great to have him in Portugal,” Wilder added. “It wasn’t about him coming and being on trial because we knew about his abilities. Taking him with us was basically getting to know him and what he’s about, what makes him tick and how he integrates with the players. Trips like what we have been on are invaluable for that.”
