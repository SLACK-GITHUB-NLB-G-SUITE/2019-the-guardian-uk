Your article on Venus and Serena Williams and how they “paved the way” for black players on the tennis tour (Gauff gets to thank Venus for growing influence, 3 July) overlooked the achievements of Althea Gibson. In 1956 she became the first African-American woman to win a Grand Slam event and would go on to win another 10, including Wimbledon twice. Bob Ryland, a former coach of Venus and Serena, said neither would have beaten Althea Gibson.Colin MaitlandBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire • I hope Alison van Uytvanck and Greet Minnen, the first openly gay couple to play doubles at Wimbledon (Report, 4 July), will appreciate the irony of their winning in straight sets.Martin CottonHemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire • An earlier sculpture by Rowland Emett (Chitty Bang Bang designer’s train fantasy for sale, 3 July) was on an agricultural theme and was titled The Hog-Muddle All-Purpose Niggler and Fidgeter Machine.

I saw it in Morecambe in 1957.David CockayneLymm, Cheshire • Re poetry books (Letters, 3 July), how about the wonderful Carnegie medal-winning The Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo and new poet laureate Simon Armitage’s stirringly enjoyable Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic, for starters?Clare AddisonMarston, Oxfordshire • I can heartily recommend You Took the Last Bus Home, the first collection of poems from Brian Bilston, the poet laureate of Twitter.Mike PenderCardiff • I was hoping Steve Bell might catch on to Johnson’s “crack negotiating team”, but his 29 bum salute (3 July) will do.
