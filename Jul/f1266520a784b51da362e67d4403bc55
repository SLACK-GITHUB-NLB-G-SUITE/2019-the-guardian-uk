A book by Norman Stone, Europe Transformed: 1878-1919, was viewed by Richard J Evans as “one of the weakest in an uneven series”. However, I remember when I came across it about 30 years ago thinking it a very lively read, of being struck by the sheer range of Stone’s knowledge, not just the usual political and military stuff but unusual areas such as changes in Viennese architecture, on which he spoke with real authority. Nothing pedestrian here, a work deserving a wide audience. I was left wishing that Stone had taught me history, whatever his personal failings might have been.
