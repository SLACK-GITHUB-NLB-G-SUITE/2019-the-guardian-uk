She’s strangled people with their own ties, stabbed them in the neck with hairpins and poisoned them with perfume. But in the third season of Killing Eve, Villanelle will perform her most iconic assassination to date: murdering the show’s creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Waller-Bridge has revealed that she plans to insert herself into the upcoming series of the hit BBC America show when it returns in 2020, as a victim of the assassin played by Jodie Comer. She told the Mirror: “I was like, I am going to write myself a part so that I can be murdered by Jodie.” She has also revealed that she originally considered herself for the roles of both Villanelle and the M15 agent Eve Polastri, played by Sandra Oh, before deciding against it in favour of casting that introduced a larger age gap between the leads. “I just had a really strong instinct that there should be this age gap because I just felt like it was something I hadn’t seen,” she said. “I’m not a 25-year-old Jodie Comer – I mean, let’s be frank. And I don’t know if I could have scaled a wall quite like she could have done, and I’m not in my early 40s either.” Waller-Bridge, who starred in her other multi-award-winning creation Fleabag, has recently spoken out about how her sudden fame has come to the detriment of her close family, who have “taken the brunt” of questions about how true to life the raw and personal show about a deeply dysfunctional family is. Waller-Bridge is currently working on the new James Bond script, following intervention from 007 himself, Daniel Craig, who asked for her specifically to inject the next Bond film with her trademark wit.
