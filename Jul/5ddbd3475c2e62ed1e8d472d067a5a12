Senator Kamala Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend that placed her in the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and music manager Scooter Braun. The question now is if attending a fundraiser hosted by Braun is enough to lose Harris the Taylor Swift voting bloc, which is actually a thing and isn’t insignificant. Swift has accused Braun of “incessant, manipulative bullying”. Last month, Braun purchased Swift’s master recordings from her first label, Big Machine Label Group, and Swift wrote a Tumblr post expressing her dismay that her “musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it”. Such an incredible night supporting our brilliant friend... candidate for President of the United States of America @KamalaHarris 🇺🇸 A post shared by  Scooter Braun (@scooterbraun) on Jul 21, 2019 at 12:53pm PDT Her avid fanbase and much of the music world rallied behind her, and Braun, who represents artists like Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, had his backers as well. The lines of loyalty were a little unclear this weekend at the Harris fundraiser, when Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, tweeted a photo of Harris with Lovato, Ariana Grande and Katy Perry – with whom Swift had just made up – all at the Braun event. Sooooo, this happened.... pic.twitter.com/xx9yegNhw6 The response was immediate, with Page Six purporting that “Taylor Swift fans rip Kamala Harris over fundraiser” – but the evidence doesn’t stack up yet. There are maybe a handful of tweets that still exist that show some Swifties angry about the fundraiser, but given the usual rapacious response from her fanbase anytime something happens in the Swiftdom, a handful feels inconsequential. Her appearance in the cursed Cats trailer drew exponentially more response. I was SO excited for you as a democratic candidate, but if you so choose to go to an event held by @scooterbraun, a man whose arrogance mirrors our president’s, I can no long hold onto my excitement and faith for you as a presidential candidate, @KamalaHarris #disappointed Some Swift fans have been hitting back at the speculation that they were angry at Kamala Harris. The only people saying shit about Taylor Swift supposedly being ~upset~ about the Kamala Harris fundraiser is Scooter Braun and his team, hoping to start more negative discussion about Taylor & her morals when in reality Taylor has always supported Kamala and her work If people are criticizing Kamala, it’s cause they don’t support her, not because they are Swifties or because of Scooter Braun of all people 🙄He’s still mad Swifties ambushed his mentions. Save your money and stop paying news outlets @scooterbraun As ridiculous as it sounds, it’s no surprise that these headlines are in our current news cycle. Taylor Swift holds significant political sway. Though she remained staunchly apolitical for much of her career, when she took a stance last year and expressed support to her then 112 million Instagram followers for two Democratic candidates, she inspired a surge in voter registrations on vote.org to the tune of 65,000 new registrations in 24 hours. Swift has since vowed to be more active in politics ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Harris, who is leading in donations in California, is a longtime Hollywood favorite, drawing in contributions from celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg, Kerry Washington, Reese Witherspoon and Halle Berry.
