A potential blockbuster bout between Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy turned instead into a technical knockout as the American clinched an emphatic three-stroke victory at the WGC-St Jude Invitational in Memphis on Sunday. Koepka took an early advantage and never eased up on his out-of-sorts rival at TPC Southwind in a forceful demonstration of why he is world No 1. He sank a series of clutch putts and posted a five-under-par 65 for his first victory in any of the four annual events that comprise the World Golf Championships series. Koepka, who started the final round one stroke behind McIlroy, finished at 16 under, with 264. It was the first time Koepka and McIlroy, both winners of four majors, had been paired in a final round. Yet McIlroy missed a short birdie putt at the 3rd from inside four feet and never recovered, his body language the only evidence needed that he was not quite on song. The Northern Irishman did not make a birdie until the 14th and ended up shooting 71 and finishing equal fourth, five shots adrift of Koepka, who won the US PGA in May. Americaâ€™s Webb Simpson (64) claimed second place on 13 under, a stroke ahead of the Australian Marc Leishman (67).
