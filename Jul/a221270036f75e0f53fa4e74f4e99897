Paulo Dybala intends to hold talks with Maurizio Sarri after he returns to training at Juventus on Thursday before deciding whether to join Manchester United. The Argentina international is wanted by United, who are offering Romelu Lukaku in a swap deal. Lukaku would be happy to join Juventus but it is not certain Dybala will accept a move to England. Dybala, who told Juventus after last season that he intended to stay, wants to understand Sarri’s plans before making a final decision. Sarri has taken over from Massimiliano Allegri as head coach but has not yet worked with Dybala, who was given time off after the Copa América. If Sarri informs Dybala that he does not see a regular first-team place for him, the player will give serious consideration to joining United. Even then, though, the 25-year-old, who can play across a variety of attacking positions, will demand wages in line with the top earners at Old Trafford before agreeing to come. His agent was in England on Tuesday for talks with United. In the meantime Lukaku remains in limbo. The terms on offer at Juventus are not a problem for the striker, who could expect to earn €8m (£7.3m) a season on a five-year contract. But a move there appears to hinge on Dybala going the other way. Lukaku has been ready to join Internazionale, who have been trying for weeks to sign him and retain an interest, but Inter have not matched United’s asking price. Their highest offer of €70m falls some way short of the €83m demanded by United and they cannot increase that without selling a player.
