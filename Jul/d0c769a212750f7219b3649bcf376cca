Selfridges has opened its Christmas shop for those who want to recover from the heatwave with some wintry seasonal cheer. The London department store, which opens its Christmas shop early every year, has proudly claimed it is again the first in the world to unveil its Christmas section, a “record” 149 days before the event itself and two days earlier than last year. The shelves are already heaving with tree decorations ranging from an £8 glitter and sequin-embellished glass bauble to a £45 Santa on a motorcycle. Other than baubles, the store has a £100 Santa Yoga figurine, meditating on his yoga mat, and from September a £2,000 pre-lit Bedminster fake Christmas tree. Selfridges said the ongoing commercial success of the shop’s early launch translated into year-on-year record sales, driven by both domestic early Christmas shoppers and souvenir-hunting tourists. Eleanor Gregory, Selfridges’ Christmas and home buyer, said: “We have so many customers visiting from all over the world, eager to snap up festive decorations and souvenirs on their London summer holidays which they can’t buy at home. “Our summer Christmas shop launch simply addresses the growing demand for convenience Christmas shopping outside the traditional Christmas season from many of our customers. They include a large number of domestic customers who love to Christmas shop very early in the year to get it wrapped and taken off their to-do list.” The Christmas shop launching on Monday is at the London store on Oxford Street, with the range also available online.
