Liverpool have completed the signing of 16-year-old winger Harvey Elliott from Fulham. Elliott, who left Craven Cottage after his youth contract expired in June, became the youngest player to feature in the Premier League when he appeared for relegated Fulham against Wolves aged 16 years and 30 days in May. He had already made his Fulham debut in the 3-1 League Cup win over Millwall in September aged 15. The England under-17 midfielder was linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Leipzig, but had been expected to seal a move to Anfield. “To have joined the club that I supported as a boy is a dream come true for me and all of my family and it’s an incredible feeling to now officially be able to call myself a Red!” the 16-year-old wrote on Instagram.
