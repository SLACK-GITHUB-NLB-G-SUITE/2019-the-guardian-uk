The Wales international Ethan Ampadu is close to continuing his development at RB Leipzig next season with Chelsea negotiating his departure on a season-long loan to the Bundesliga club. Ampadu, who has eight senior caps, underwent a medical in Germany on Friday having been omitted from the Chelsea senior squad who are currently in Japan on a two-game pre-season tour. Frank Lampard, who had attempted to secure the youngster while Derby manager, had made clear his intention to loan out the 18-year-old in search of regular first-team football for the season ahead. The former Exeter City player made more appearances for his country than his club last season. Leipzig, who are close to securing Ademola Lookman from Everton this summer, will tap into Ampadu’s versatility with the teenager able to operate in defensive midfield and at centre-half. Lampard is to make decisions on the future of Chelsea’s other fringe and youth graduates in what remains of the window, with others likely to move on season-long deals away from Stamford Bridge despite the club being unable to add to their own squad due to Fifa’s transfer ban.
