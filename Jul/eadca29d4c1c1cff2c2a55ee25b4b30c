Outside a shop in this town, a sign reads: “When you buy from a small business you’re not helping a CEO buy a third holiday home. You are helping a little girl get dance lessons, a little boy get his first pair of football boots and a mum and dad put food on the table. Thank you for shopping local.”Richard TitfordSudbury, Suffolk • Jacob Rees-Mogg should be wary of demanding use of imperial measure-ments when most others use metric (Rees-Mogg Esq bans metric, 27 July).
