Salomón Rondón has linked up again with Rafael Benítez after joining the Chinese Super League club Dalian Yifang from West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee. The striker spent last season on loan at Newcastle under Benítez, who left St James’ Park for China this month. Rondón joined West Brom in 2015, making 120 appearances and scoring 28 goals before their relegation from the Premier League in 2018. The Venezuela international made 33 appearances for Newcastle last season. “The club wishes Salomón and his family all the very best in the future,” said a West Brom statement.
