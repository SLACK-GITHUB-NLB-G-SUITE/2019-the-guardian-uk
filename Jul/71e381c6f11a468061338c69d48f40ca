Leicester are on the verge of signing Ayoze Pérez from Newcastle for around £30m. It is understood the 25-year-old striker has been granted permission to speak to Leicester, who are confident of completing a deal that will make the Spaniard their second signing of the summer after they triggered a buyout clause in his contract. Pérez scored 12 Premier League goals last season, with his excellent partnership with Salomón Rondón helping Newcastle to pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle will make a large profit on a player signed from Tenerife for £1.5m in 2014, but his departure also leaves a sizeable hole to fill. Pérez has been Newcastle’s top scorer in all competitions in each of the past two seasons, getting 13 goals in the last campaign and also reaching double figures the year before. His arrival will increase Leicester’s attacking options and raise the prospect of Pérez playing alongside Jamie Vardy. Leicester have tried and failed to find a player to fulfil that second striker role in recent years, with Kelechi Iheanacho enduring two difficult seasons following his arrival from Manchester City. Pérez can also play as a wide attacker and that versatility, together with his age and his excellent form for Newcastle in the second half of the season, when he scored 11 goals, made him an attractive proposition for Leicester and their manager, Brendan Rodgers, who has already added James Justin, a 21-year-old full-back, to his squad from Luton. Leicester’s determination to strengthen with major signings will not end with Pérez, and funds will be available irrespective of Harry Maguire’s future. Manchester United are the more likely destination for Maguire as things stand, with Manchester City discouraged by Leicester’s asking price, but there are also questions as to whether United will be willing to pay more than £75m for the England centre-half.
