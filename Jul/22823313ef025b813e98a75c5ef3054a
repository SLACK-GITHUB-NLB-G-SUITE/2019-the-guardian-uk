Paul Pogba’s hopes of leaving Manchester United this summer are becoming remote with the club receiving no bids for the midfielder and the transfer window closing in less than a month. The deadline of this summer’s transfer window is 8 August and is an issue regarding any potential deal. Ole Gunnar Solskjær has already lost a midfielder in Ander Herrera, who joined Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, so if Pogba was to depart it would be difficult for the manager to have to replace a second midfielder in the three and a half weeks left of the window. Real Madrid would like to sign Pogba but their valuation is markedly lower than United’s. Real price him between £100-120m with United wanting closer to £170m. Both Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola have recently admitted the player’s wish would be to leave so if he was to stay Solskjær would face a challenge to ensure dressing room harmony is not affected.
