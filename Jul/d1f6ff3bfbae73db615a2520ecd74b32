Marmite lovers are in for a treat as an extra strong version of the spread goes on sale on Monday in Tesco stores nationwide. Priced at £3.99 for a 250g jar, Marmite XO (extra old) has been matured for 28 days – four times longer than the classic version – giving it a “more intense, full-bodied taste”, according to its maker Unilever. The product was first launched as a limited edition nearly a decade ago and is back after a campaign from fans on social media. Camilla Williamson, a brand manager at Marmite, said: “Whether it’s smothered on a crumpet or spread on a slice of sourdough, the recipe has built a cult following – with the public often taking to social media to call for its return.” Known as a “love it or hate it” product, Marmite has featured in a number of celebrity chef recipes, including Nigella Lawson’s spaghetti with Marmite and Jamie Oliver’s Marmite popcorn. The super-strength version was first created in 2010 after members of the “Marmararti” – a group of some of Marmite’s biggest fans – tasted a number of formulas before selecting the XO recipe. The revived XO will be available exclusively in Tesco stores for six months before being rolled out to other supermarkets subject to demand. The classic version of the vegetarian spread was first conceived in 1902 and has been made in Burton-on-Trent ever since. In 2016 Tesco ran short of stocks of Marmite and a number of household brands after a row with Unilever over prices. Dubbed Marmitegate, Unilever halted deliveries to Tesco after the supermarket refused to stump up across-the-board price rises of about 10% for a range of brands. The consumer goods group blamed the rise on the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. The dispute was quickly resolved and Marmite stocks were replenished.
