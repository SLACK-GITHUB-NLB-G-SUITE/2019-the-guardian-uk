Firefighters are tackling a blaze which broke out late on Wednesday night at Warner Bros’ studios outside London. No injuries have been reported, and the fire is said to have started on a sound stage not currently in use. “[Hertfordshire] Fire and Rescue Service were called to reports of a fire at Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden at 11.29pm on Wednesday, 10 July,” said a spokesperson for Hertfordshire County Council. Fifteen engines were on the scene, they said. “The incident is ongoing.” All eight of the Harry Potter films were shot at Leavesden, which now houses the Harry Potter studio tour. This attraction, which opened in 2012 and receives up to 6,000 visitors a day, is said to be unaffected by the blaze. Armando Iannucci’s HBO space comedy, Avenue 5, is currently in production at Leavesden. The studio began life as an aircraft factory during the second world war but was converted in 1994 at the behest of producers on Bond movie GoldenEye. Other major franchises to use the studio include Mission: Impossible and Fast and Furious. The first Star Wars prequel, The Phantom Menace, was also filmed at Leavesden. In 2010, a fire at the studio damaged some of the Potter sets. Last month, a man suffered a neck injury after being stabbed on the set of Anne Hathaway film Witches.
