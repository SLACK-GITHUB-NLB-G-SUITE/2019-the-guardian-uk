Philip Billing has joined Bournemouth from Huddersfield for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £15m. The Denmark Under-21 midfielder’s move was confirmed by Bournemouth on Monday, with the 23-year-old signing a long-term contract. “I’m delighted to become an AFC Bournemouth player,” said Billing, who made 91 appearances in all competitions for Huddersfield after joining from Esbjerg in 2013 . “As soon as I heard of the club’s interest there was never any doubt in my mind. It was an easy decision to make to come into a squad which is full of talented, international players and working with a manager of Eddie Howe’s quality. This is an exciting step forward for me and I can’t wait to get started.” Meanwhile Wolves are expected to complete the signing of the Milan forward Patrick Cutrone when the 21-year-old arrives in the Midlands on Monday for a medical. He will sign a five-year contract at Molineux. Idrissa Gueye’s €32m move to Paris Saint-Germain from Everton is also nearing completion after the Senegal midfielder’s medical on Monday.
