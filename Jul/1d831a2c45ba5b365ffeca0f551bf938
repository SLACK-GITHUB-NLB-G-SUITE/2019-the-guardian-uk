The biggest name in racing will make his way to one of the sport’s less celebrated venues on Wednesday evening when Frankie Dettori heads to the west of Ireland for four rides at the Killarney Festival, which would have a potential return around 540 points to a one point unit stake if combined in a “Frankie Yankee” at their current odds. Dettori has not ridden in County Kerry since 1998, when he drew a crowd of 6,000 to the now-defunct course at Tralee, and he arrives at Killarney in the middle of one of his most successful seasons for many years. As a result, interest in the four-timer on Time Tunnel (6.30), Mujid (7.00), Lady Wannabe (7.30) and Finding Nero (8.30) is likely to be significant, as the biggest outsider among them is a 9-2 shot. It will be painful for the bookies if all four oblige, but there is no sign – as yet, anyway – that any Irish bookies will follow the lead of their UK-based competitors in recent weeks and duck out of multiples on Dettori’s mounts. There are only four of them, after all, although John Gosden’s decision to supplement Star Catcher, the Ribblesdale winner, for Saturday’s Irish Oaks could turn it into a Frankie Super Yankee (returning about 4,000 points to a one point unit stake at Star Catcher’s current odds of around 5-1). This flying visit by Dettori is quite a coup for Killarney, which describes itself, with some justification, as “Ireland’s most scenic racecourse”, situated as it is among the mountains and loughs of the Killarney National Park. It was organised by Philip O’Brien, Killarney’s racing manager, via Ray Cochrane, Dettori’s long-standing agent, and the jockey’s target will be to at least match the achievement of Lester Piggott on his only visit to Killarney in 1991, when he too had four rides and came home in front on three. What are his chances? In all likelihood, Dettori will struggle to match Piggott. Time Tunnel is the top-rated runner but drawn very wide in stall 14, while Lady Wannabe has something to find with Viadera in the Listed Cairn Rouge Stakes, the feature event. Mujid is another with a bit to find and it may be that the big crowd will end up banking on Finding Nero to send them home happy. Dettori will be watching the opener from the weighing room but it could be a race of some interest to punters, as Aidan O’Brien has three runners in a contest which he won 12 months ago with this year’s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck. Masar, the colt that ended Godolphin’s long wait for a Derby winner in their royal blue colours, has been retired to join the stallion roster at Sheikh Mohammed’s Darley Stud after failing to win either of his two starts following his victory at Epsom 13 months ago. An early departure for the breeding sheds had seemed increasingly likely for Masar after he finished last of the six runners when odds-on for the Group Two Princess Of Wales’s Stakes at Newmarket last week. His disappointing run there followed a fifth-place finish in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot in mid-June, when Masar was running for the first time since winning the Derby having suffered a season-ending injury last July. Masar is the third Derby winner in the last nine years to retire without adding another win to his record, following Pour Moi (2011), who did not race again after Epsom due to injury, and Wings Of Eagles (2017), who suffered a career-ending injury in the Irish Derby on his next start after the Classic. On the British cards, meanwhile, Danny Tudhope has decent hopes of a double at Catterick via Betsey Trotter (2.30) and Zumurud (3.30), while Hurricane Alert (3.10) is fairly priced at around 6-1 on the card at Lingfield Park. Invincible Larne (8.40) should go well at Yarmouth while the best bet of the day could well be Across The Sea (8.25). James Tate’s filly returned to form when second at Newbury last time out and goes to post with an outstanding chance if she can run close to that.
