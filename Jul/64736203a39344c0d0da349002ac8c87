Could I point out to Ken Courtenay (Letters, 27 July) that autistic people also have much reduced life expectancy compared with the neurotypical community but there is no programme to address this. Deaths of autistic people are not automatically reviewed and there are no autism annual health checks or autism nurses in hospitals. This needs to be addressed as well as the situation for patients with an intellectual disability.Ruth CoomberNeedham Market, Suffolk • Even a list as short as five should include Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (The five children’s books every adult should read, 27 July).Cherry WestonWolverhampton • Thought I’d try the simple fix meal in the Feast section of Saturday’s paper – 22 ingredients listed. I won’t go for a complicated recipe then.Lesley MatthewsShipley, West Yorkshire • Surely an enterprising compiler can produce a crossword that would really get up Rees-Mogg’s nose (Comma touch, 27 July).Ruth RhodenKidderminster, Worcestershire • Audrey Butler’s observations on being addressed struck a chord with me (Letters, 26 July). Medical staff’s language seems to have changed as I’ve got older. I’ve been asked about my “poo” and had a nurse ask if I’ve managed to “pee-pee”. Either they’re infantilising me, or they’ve become very coy.Emyr OwenLlanfairfechan, Conwy • You’re lucky, Audrey Butler.
