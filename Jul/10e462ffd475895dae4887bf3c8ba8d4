Six tourists have been killed and dozens of people injured in a fierce storm in northern Greece, authorities have said. Strong winds and hail hit the Halkidiki region near the city of Thessaloniki late on Wednesday. Television footage showed overturned cars, fallen trees, torn roofs and mudslides. The freak storm lasted about 20 minutes, according to witnesses interviewed by the state broadcaster ERT. Charalambos Steriadis, the head of civil protection in northern Greece, said: “It was an unprecedented phenomenon. Six tourists were killed and at least 30 people were injured during this cyclone.” Officials have declared a state of emergency. The storm overturned and ripped open a caravan occupied by a Czech family, killing an elderly couple and injuring their son and grandson. Elsewhere in the region, a Russian man and his son were killed by a falling tree, and a woman from Romania and her child died when the roof of a restaurant caved in while dozens of people were dining, police said. Michalis Chrisochoidis, the citizen protection minister overseeing operations in the area, said: “I want to express my sorrow on behalf of all … We mourn for the loss of these souls. We are in solidarity with their relatives, with the people who have lost their families.” According to port police, a fisherman in his 60s was also missing. The freak weather knocked out power in the area, with army crews working to restore services. At least 140 rescue workers were involved in the operation, said the emergency chief, Vassilis Varthakoyannis. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who took over on Sunday after winning the general election, cancelled meetings to address the disaster, his office said. Temperatures in Greece had soared to 37C (98.6F) over the past two days.
