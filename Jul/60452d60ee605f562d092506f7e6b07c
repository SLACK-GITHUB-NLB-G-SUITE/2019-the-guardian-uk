Cut three long, thin Romano peppers in half lengthways, scrape out and discard the seeds, then lay the peppers snugly in a roasting tin. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cut a large courgette into diagonal slices, about ½cm thick. Peel 4 small oval shallots then put them, together with the courgettes, into the roasting tin. Add 400g of whole cherry tomatoes. Peel and flatten 4 cloves of garlic, tucking them among the vegetables along with 4 sprigs of rosemary. Pour 6 tbsp of olive oil over the vegetables, then roast them for about an hour until everything is soft and sweet. Mix together 100ml of yogurt, a little salt and 2 tsp of sumac. Remove the roast vegetables from the oven and lightly stir 4 tbsp of the oil and juices into the yogurt, then trickle it over the vegetables and serve. Enough for 2. The mixture of tomatoes, courgettes and shallots will release lots of juice which is stirred into the yogurt to form the dressing. Roasting the peppers and tomatoes long enough that their skins singe a little will lend a pleasing, deep smoky flavour to the dressing. Introduce slices of aubergine to the roasted vegetables. Cut an aubergine in half lengthways, then into ½cm thick slices, then tuck it among the tomatoes and peppers in place of the courgettes. It is worth adding a handful of basil or coriander leaves, ripped to shreds, to the juices as you mix them with the yogurt.
