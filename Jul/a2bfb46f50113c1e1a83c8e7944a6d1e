Cucumber, gin, elderflower, lemon and a big measure of fizz – what could be more summery and refreshing than that? Serves 1 1 long cucumber ribbon – use a vegetable peeler to cut it25ml gin – we use Hendrick’s15ml good-quality elderflower cordial – we use Belvoir15ml lemon juice75ml champagne Curl the cucumber ribbon inside a champagne flute, so it runs around the inside of the glass from top to bottom. In a boston shaker, shake the gin, cordial and lemon juice over ice, then double strain into the flute. Top up with well-chilled champagne and serve. • Besmir Dauti, Riding House Cafe, London W1
