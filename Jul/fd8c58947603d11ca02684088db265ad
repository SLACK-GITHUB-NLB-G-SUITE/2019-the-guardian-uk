Arsenal have confirmed the signing of the Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos on a season-long loan. The Spaniard is the club’s second summer signing, after the 18-year-old striker Gabriel Martinelli. Ceballos captained Spain’s Under-21s to European championship glory in June and won player of the tournament two years ago. “We’re excited to see Dani join us,” said Arsenal’s manager, Unai Emery. “He is a talented player with big technical ability, creativity and precision.” Ceballos has been given the No 8 shirt by Arsenal, who hope he can fill the void left by Aaron Ramsey’s move to Juventus on a free. He could make his debut against Lyon in the Emirates Cup on Sunday. “The coach was the turning point in terms of me joining this massive club,” Ceballos, who has six Spain caps, told the club’s website. “He’s a Spanish coach and he knows me from my time at other clubs … I knew I had the confidence of the coach, which was very important.” He added of Emery: “He’s a very tactical coach and I think that’s going to really help me to perfect my positioning.” Arsenal are likely to confirm the signing of the St Etienne defender William Saliba in the coming days before loaning the 18-year-old back to the French club.
