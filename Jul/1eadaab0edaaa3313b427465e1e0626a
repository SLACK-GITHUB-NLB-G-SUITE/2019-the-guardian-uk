The Dalai Lama has become the latest person to be “cancelled” by the internet, a victim of today’s online culture, in which one conversation can get anyone disavowed. Sixty years ago, the Dalai Lama fled his homeland of Tibet on horseback because of Chinese persecution against Buddhists, and 30 years ago he received the Nobel peace prize for being a messenger of non-violence. But recently, the BBC’s Rajini Vaidyanathan interviewed His Holiness on the subject of Donald Trump, immigration and a possible successor, and some people are now calling his responses sexist and nationalist. (For example, saying he did not want to see Europe become “Muslim” or “African”.) He also reiterated controversial remarks he made in 2015 about a potential female successor, saying: “If female Dalai Lama comes, then that female must be very attractive … otherwise not much use.” All of which has inspired calls across the Twitterverse to “cancel” His Holiness: The Dalai Lama is cancelled. https://t.co/3KLS1EjHLT i most certainly did not have "the dalai lama gets cancelled" on my 2019 bingo card https://t.co/sO9p6AiIUg Today in Men are Trash: Yes, even the Dalai Lama, who believes a female successor should be "very, very attractive," otherwise there would be "not much use." 🤷🏻‍♀️ Let's all just die, girls. Even the Dalai Lama hates us. https://t.co/aXdIZVEakU The Dalai Lama issued a statement to clarify the remarks he made in the interview. “Firstly, in responding to a question about whether his own reincarnation could be a woman, and suggesting that if she were she should be attractive, His Holiness genuinely meant no offence. He is deeply sorry that people have been hurt by what he said and offers his sincere apologies.” This apology wasn’t enough for some, which underscores the impact of being cancelled online. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to recover from a cancellation. You said it we heard it. Bye. He still has some fervent defenders on social media: For all his long life, His Holiness has opposed the objectification of women, has supported women and their rights and celebrated the growing international consensus in support of gender equality and respect for women. But some people are even questioning all men, or at least the validity of #NotAllMen, the popular argument against the vilification of men in the #MeToo era, in light of the Dalai Lama’s statements. The argument that not all men are terrible has been used against those who believe men are inherently misogynistic. But if one of the most well-known humanitarian leaders alive can make sexist statements, who are we left to trust? The Dalai Lama has really done us a disservice, lads.We’ve always been able to use the “but not all men are sexist.” when the latest horror story hits social media, but now, all we’ll get will be “Well, if the Dalai fucking Lama is, what chance you being one of the good ones." Perhaps it’s not all men. Just most of them. At least, according to the internet.
