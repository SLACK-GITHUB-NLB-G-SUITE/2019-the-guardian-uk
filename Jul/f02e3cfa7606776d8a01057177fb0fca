Sam Moore was one of the finest lecturers I came across in a 45-year period in British universities. He entertained a class of postgraduate students on Friday afternoons, 1969-70, on the MA (Econ) degree at Manchester University, teaching the then new course of computing. Atlas autocode was the programming language and he taught us many of the tricks of the trade, accessing the universityâ€™s monster mainframe machine via flexowriter and paper tapes or, if you were lucky, punched paper cards. Lectures were lightened by his anecdotes and classes often adjourned to the nearby College Arms. Sam later rose through the ranks to become vice-chancellor of the university but he will be better remembered by the Dover Street class of 1970 for his teaching, lecturing and beer-drinking skills.
