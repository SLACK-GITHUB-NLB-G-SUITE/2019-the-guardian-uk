A car bomb in central Afghanistan has killed at least eight members of the security forces and four civilians and wounded dozens, many of them students attending a nearby school. Hasan Raza Yousafi, a provincial council member, said the target of Sunday’s suicide attack was an intelligence unit compound in Ghazni, the capital of the province of the same name. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed claimed responsibility, saying several intelligence agents were killed. The attack comes as an all-Afghan two-day conference that includes the Taliban begins in Doha in an effort to find an end to Afghanistan’s relentless wars. US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said the latest round of talks with the Taliban, also in Doha, were the most productive ever.
