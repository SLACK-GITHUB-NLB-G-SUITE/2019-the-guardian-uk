The maker of Irn-Bru and Rubicon drinks has warned of a 20% drop in annual profits after being hit by poor weather and the impact of last year’s sugar tax. AG Barr, which also makes Rockstar energy drinks and Funkin fruit cocktail mixers, blamed disappointing spring and early summer weather, especially in its Scottish heartland and the north of England, which contrasts with last year’s long, hot summer when sales surged. Roger White, the AG Barr chief executive, said: “The impulse on-the-go market is not growing, driven by the weather. The weather has been less good than the long-term average. There are some significant year-on-year challenges.” AG Barr’s shares crashed 30% to 616.8p. The Cumbernauld-based soft drinks company cut prices last year to boost sales, and said revenues this year had been affected by a return to its usual prices. The firm changed the “secret recipe” of its flagship Irn-Bru drink to reduce its sugar content before the new tax came into force in April 2018, along with the formulas of Rockstar , Rubicon and other drinks. Nearly all its products escaped the sugar levy but some customers were put off by the changes. AG Barr said its new Irn-Bru energy drink and Funkin ready-to-drink cocktails in cans were selling well. It plans to launch three new Rockstar drinks at the end of the summer and to improve the recipe of its Rubicon juices, faced with tough competition from Monster Energy, owned by Coca-Cola, and a declining fruit drinks market. However, the benefits will not be felt until later this year and AG Barr expects revenues of £123m in the six months to 27 July, down 10% from last year. Profits in the full year are likely about 20% lower than last year’s £45m. AG Barr warned that action to regain momentum would result in additional one-off costs.
