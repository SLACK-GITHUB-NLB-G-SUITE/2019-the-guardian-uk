Nigel Farage has spoken out against Channel 4 for a “totally sick” scene in the comedy Year of The Rabbit that shows a right-wing campaigner named Neil Fromage being shot in the head. The Brexit party leader called the moment in Matt Berry’s spoof show, in which the character of Fromage is killed while giving an anti-immigration speech, “totally sick and frankly irresponsible”. Speaking to the Daily Star on Sunday, Farage went on to attack the network: “With Channel 4, we have reached a point where they are so partisan politically in everything they do that they now consistently go beyond what’s acceptable.” Berry’s comedy about a policeman romping swearily around rat-ridden Victorian London was described by the Guardian review as “a heady mix of period detail, gleeful anachronism and baroque profanity.” In the assassination scene, Fromage takes to a soapbox and says: “Immigrants infest this city they do … like a cancer. And if they take over, you can be sure of one thing.” “Far better restaurants?” a character in the crowd interjects. “Blood, blood, blood.” Farage’s outrage comes weeks after his fury at comedian Jo Brand, who made a gag on BBC Radio 4 show Heresy about the recent incident at which a milkshake was thrown over him: “Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?” The BBC said Brand’s jokes were “deliberately provocative”, as the show’s title suggests. A spokesperson for Channel 4 said: “Year of the Rabbit is a purposefully outrageous and heightened comedy set in Victorian-era London featuring exaggerated and ridiculous fictional characters and in this context it is clear to viewers that the actions of these characters – be they grave robbers, murderous historical preservation enthusiasts or serial killer politicians – are preposterous and not to be taken seriously.” The episode will air on Monday at 10pm.
