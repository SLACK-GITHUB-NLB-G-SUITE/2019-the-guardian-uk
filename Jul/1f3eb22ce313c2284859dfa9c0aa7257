Michael Winterbottom has been making films for nearly 25 years, and in that time has earned a reputation as one of the UK’s most dazzlingly varied film-makers. Winterbottom’s work has encompassed the hypernaturalist migrant travelogue In This World and the bleak Thomas Hardy adaptation Jude; the committed hostage drama A Mighty Heart and the sadistic noir thriller The Killer Inside Me. Along the way he has developed an outstanding creative relationship with Steve Coogan: together they made the Factory Records comedy 24 Hour Party People, the metatextual Tristram Shandy adaptation A Cock and Bull Story, the breezy Paul Raymond biopic The Look of Love, and three series (to date) of restaurant-tour comedy The Trip. Winterbottom and Coogan have another one coming up, the Philip Green-inspired satire Greed, but before that Winterbottom is releasing The Wedding Guest, a thriller set in Pakistan and India starring Dev Patel as a mysterious outsider who kidnaps Radhika Apte as she is about to be forcibly married off. The Wedding Guest is out in the UK on Friday, and now is your chance to ask the director questions about this – and anything else – in our webchat with him, which takes place at 13.00 BST on Thursday 18 July.
