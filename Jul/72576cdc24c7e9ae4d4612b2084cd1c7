Late last year Booking.com advertised a promotion of £80 cashback on future hotel reservations costing £350 or more. On this basis, I booked a hotel in Seville for £359. I paid the bill on leaving, which Booking.com said would trigger the reward to be paid in 60 working days. However, that date came and went. Since then, further promises that the money would be paid have gone unrewarded. Fed up, we rang Booking.com this afternoon, but after spending an hour on the phone we got nowhere and were then cut off. I now wonder if the firm can be trusted?HA, by email In April I received a letter from Booking.com offering £40 cashback if I booked accommodation for over £150 before 10 June. I booked a room in St Andrews for £160 and applied for cashback. It requested that I send a photo of the letter. I have done this three times and still not received the £40. What’s going on?AY, Aberdeen Booking.com has become massive, principally because it is a super-easy way to book rooms. It also appears to have worked to halt complaints from readers who booked cancellable bookings, only to find they couldn’t be cancelled. However, trying to contact this firm following a problem is still an issue. These letters arrived within hours of each other, and while the firm sorted them out quickly after we intervened, it really shouldn’t have taken our involvement. Booking.com blamed “a small technical issue”. It has now made the payments and apologised. Has anyone else experienced problems claiming Booking.com rewards? Email the usual address.
