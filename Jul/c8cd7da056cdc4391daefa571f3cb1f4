The ICC has denied responsibility for the low-scoring pitches at this World Cup after yet another turgid surface was produced for the first semi-final between India and New Zealand in Manchester. New Zealand found scoring tough on a slow, two-paced track after winning the toss, making 211 for five in 46.1 overs before rain forced this contest into a reserve day. It followed the theme of a tournament where low scores have been the norm on markedly different pitches from those seen in ODI cricket in England over recent years. That has led to accusations that the ICC has instructed local groundsmen to prepare slower surfaces than normal. But world cricket’s governing body said: “Essentially the venues are responsible for the pitch preparation which is done with oversight and guidance from the ICC and our independent pitch consultant. “The guidance we give any host of an ICC event is to prepare the best possible pitches for the conditions in that country – so in this case the best possible ODI pitch for typical English conditions and we would also look for even bounce and good carry. The ICC does not instruct groundsmen to prepare pitches in a certain way to advantage, or disadvantage, any team.” The surface for this semi-final sparked heavy criticism from the former England batsman Mark Butcher, who tweeted: “Sorry, but pitches have been garbage this tournament. Uneven, two-paced, shit heaps MIGHT give you an exciting 5 overs at the end of a run chase, but you’ve scared everybody off in the previous 95. Crap.” England’s Jonny Bairstow has previously questioned why World Cup pitches have been so different from those normally seen in England. “The pitches we’ve been playing on the last two years are surely the pitches we would be playing on in a World Cup? I don’t know why they’ve changed,” Bairstow said.
