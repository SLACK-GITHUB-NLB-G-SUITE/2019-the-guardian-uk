David de Gea has said he would love to be named Manchester United captain as the goalkeeper prepares to extend his stay with the club. The 28-year-old is understood to be preparing to sign an improved contract that is likely to run to 2025. He is keen to take on the captaincy, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær yet to confirm who will get the role after Antonio Valencia’s summer exit. “I’ve been captain for some games,” De Gea said. “Of course, it is amazing to be captain of a club like Manchester United and defend this badge. It’s amazing, so of course I’ll be really, really happy to captain.” De Gea, who joined in 2011 and has been the club’s player of the year on a record four occasions, spelled out his ambitions for next season: “We have to improve a lot. We are Manchester United; we need to fight for trophies.” Juan Mata hopes Paul Pogba will be part of that fight amid uncertainty over the France international’s future. “He’s a fantastic midfielder and he’s a very good guy, very positive, good influence for everyone,” Mata said. “I think he’s happy, he brings everyone together … As a teammate, and as a friend also, I would like him to stay.”
