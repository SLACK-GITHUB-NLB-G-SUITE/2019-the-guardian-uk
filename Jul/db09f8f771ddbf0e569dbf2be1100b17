The award-winning Guardian photographer Tom Jenkins took up a prime spot – on the roof of a lorry’s cab – to capture the peloton passing through Goudhurst during the 2007 Tour de France. The race had kicked off from central London a few days earlier, before its 200 competitors hit the roads of Kent in a fight to the finish in Canterbury. For Jenkins, who spent most of the day on the back of one of the motorbikes that travel with the peleton, it was a return to his roots – he grew up nearby. “Call it naivety, call it blind optimism,” wrote The Guardian’s William Fotheringham at the time, “but there may, just may be a British Tour de France winner out there somewhere.” He only had to wait five years: Bradley Wiggins won it in 2012, the first of a long run of British winners. Can Geraint Thomas – the defending champion – do it again this year?
