Jimmy Anderson will miss England’s Test against Ireland because of a right calf injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced. Anderson has failed to recover from the injury sustained to his right leg when playing for his county Lancashire against Durham on 2 July. “Jimmy will continue to be assessed ahead of the first Specsavers Ashes Test at Edgbaston on 1 August,” an ECB statement read. Anderson is one of a number of England bowlers struggling with injury. Mark Wood is expected to be out for between four and six weeks with a side strain sustained during the World Cup final victory against New Zealand. He will not feature in the one-off Test against Ireland at Lord’s this week, nor the first Test against Australia when the Ashes get under way at Edgbaston. He is targeting the final two Ashes Tests for a possible return. Jofra Archer also has a left side strain and has been on holiday in Barbados. He is expected to be fit for the second Ashes Test on 14 August in a best-case scenario.
