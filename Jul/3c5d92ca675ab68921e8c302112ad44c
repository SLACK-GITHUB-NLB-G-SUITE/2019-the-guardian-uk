Everton are considering a move for Fabian Delph, with the Manchester City midfielder open to leaving the Premier League champions in search of regular first-team football. Delph has entered the final year of his contract and his opportunities under Pep Guardiola are likely to be impacted by the arrival of the central midfielder Rodri from Atlético Madrid plus the return of the left-back Angelino from PSV Eindhoven. The 29-year-old’s position has alerted several Premier League clubs and Everton are among those interested in the versatile England international. Marco Silva has ample cover at left-back with Leighton Baines having signed a one-year contract extension to provide experienced support for Lucas Digne. The Everton manager may need to strengthen in central midfield, however, despite the recent £22m arrival of André Gomes from Barcelona. Idrissa Gueye’s future remains uncertain after he was denied a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in January, and James McCarthy and Muhamed Besic could leave. Silva wants several more additions, with a permanent deal for the Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma chief among them. The Juventus forward Moise Kean is another potential target, although Everton are yet to make an official move for the 19-year-old Italy international.
