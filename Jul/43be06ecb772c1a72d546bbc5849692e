Five people have been taken to hospital after being injured during the running of the bulls at San Fermín festival in Pamplona, the Red Cross has said. Across seven days in July, thousands of people, many wearing traditional white shirts with red scarves, line the streets of the Spanish city to take part in the centuries-old tradition of running with the bulls. Over a half-a-mile chase, 12 specially bred bulls race from their pen to the city’s bullring, with some people from the crowd running alongside while trying to dodge the animals. The Red Cross said none of the runners injured on Saturday were gored by the bulls. Two sustained arm injuries after falling, two others had head contusions and one sustained a thorax injury. The bulls are killed in the ring later in the day.
