The history of the many incarnations and issues of the Pride movement is explored in this earnest, informative but sometimes unwieldy documentary. Ashley Joiner’s thoroughly researched film contextualises Pride as a celebration born out of a reaction to the hostility, repression and incomprehension faced by gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans and queer people. But even within something as theoretically unifying as Pride, not everyone feels included. The film attempts to address intersectionality, to give voice to more marginalised communities – splinter group events include a trans march in Brighton and a Latinx vigil for the victims of the Orlando gay club shooting. The film also calls Pride to account for the increasing commercialisation that has, according to some, diluted the politics and the protest of the event. “It’s OK to have a party,” says one interviewee, “but to party in ignorance is dangerous.” Ultimately, that’s a lot of representation to cram into a single film, leading to a cluttered structure. Perhaps this subject might have been better served by a three-part television series.
