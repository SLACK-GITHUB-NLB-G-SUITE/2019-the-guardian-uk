Has the Guardian never heard of the precautionary principle (How baseless fears over 5G rollout created a health scare, 26 July)? The one the Stewart report (from the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones) called for in 2000, but which has been ignored ever since? The one that says government has a responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk? Whatever labels – “baseless”, “half-science”, “cherry-picked” – you put on it, there is quite a lot of science demonstrating plausible risk of harm from electromagnetic fields, far too much to dismiss with a chuckle from the hardly impartial head of technology communications for EE, Howard Jones. In contrast, Martin Pall has published extensively on this subject, including demonstrating the principal mechanisms of harm, and that this happens the same way in animals and plants as in humans.Dr Damien Downing President, British Society for Ecological Medicine • Alex Hern makes no mention of the warnings of 248 scientists from the EMF scientist appeal and the thousands of peer-reviewed studies in medical literature to show wireless radiation has a multitude of harmful bio-effects, including cancer, and that adding 5G to the mix will create a global health crisis. He makes no mention of the “clear evidence” of heart and brain tumours from the recent US National Toxicology Program and the same finding from the large-scale Ramazzini Institute study. Emeritus professors in human radiation effects and biochemistry have been campaigning on this issue for years, and independent scientists insist there is no longer any cause for debate. Campaigners against 5G are not fear-mongering, we are simply alerting people to the evidence, which in itself is frightening.
