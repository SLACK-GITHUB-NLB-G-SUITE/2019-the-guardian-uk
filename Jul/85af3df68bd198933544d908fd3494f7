The outstanding dual Arc winner Enable, who has not raced since extending her winning streak to nine at last year’s Breeders’ Cup, is odds-against to make a successful return to action in Saturday’s Coral-Eclipse Stakes at Sandown after 13 possible runners were declared for the Group One race on Monday. Enable is top-priced at 5-4 to win her 10th race in a row, a price which reflects the strength of her possible opposition this weekend. Two recent winners at Royal Ascot – Circus Maximus (6-1), who took the St James’s Palace Stakes, and the Wolferton Stakes winner Addeybb (25-1) – are potential rivals, while the race-fit Magical (5-1) was less than a length behind Enable in last November’s Breeders’ Cup Turf. Sir Michael Stoute’s Regal Reality (7-1), who took the Brigadier Gerard Stakes over the Eclipse course and distance in May, is another intriguing contender along with Derby disappointment Telecaster (16-1), the impressive Dante Stakes winner at York earlier in the season. The Eclipse is the first Group One contest of the British season in which three-year-olds can take on older horses and has been won by many of the sport’s greatest names since it was first run in 1886, including Mill Reef, Brigadier Gerard, Dancing Brave and Sea The Stars. Three-year-olds have taken three of the last four runnings of the Eclipse, via Golden Horn (2015), Hawkbill (2016) and Roaring Lion (2018) but overall the balance between the Classic generations and the older horses has been very even in terms of their representation. Three-year-olds have supplied 32% of the runners since 2003, and 31% of winners. It is also a race that Aidan O’Brien has struggled to dominate as thoroughly as he has many other Group One events. While O’Brien has had five winners of the race, one fewer than Stoute and Alec Taylor, who hold the record with six, he has saddled a dozen runners without success since So You Think’s win in 2011. O’Brien’s lean run includes two beaten favourites in Cliffs Of Moher (a 7-4 chance in 2017) and The Gurkha, who was odds-on at 4-6 three seasons ago, one of three horses beaten at odds-on for the Eclipse since 2003. All three were from the Classic generation, including two Derby winners – Motivator at 2-5 in 2005 and Authorized at 4-7 two seasons later. The sight of Enable being offered at odds-against when she has not tasted defeat since April 2017 may prove irresistible for many punters, and the early movement in her price on Monday afternoon was towards even-money. From 7-4 overnight, she is now a 5-4 chance with Bet365 and 11-10 elsewhere. Enable’s main target this season is a return to Longchamp in early October for an attempt to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe for an unprecedented third time. She has already missed two possible dates for the first start of her five-year-old season in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in early June and the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot and her return to action on Saturday promises to be one of the season’s defining moments.
