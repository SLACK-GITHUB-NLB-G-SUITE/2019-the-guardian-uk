When I first saw Dr John I was a fan of his extraordinary Voodoo-drenched music but not really an admirer of him as a person. Acutely aware of his heroin addiction and involvement in the seedy New Orleans underworld, I’d not made any great attempt to go to one of his gigs. When I did finally get to see him, in the early 1980s, it was almost by accident. One Sunday morning a friend told me there was going to be a free blues concert on Clapham Common, in south London, that afternoon. He had no idea who was appearing, and to my amazement it was the Night Tripper himself, already a major league artist by that time. He was all alone playing the piano, drawling the lyrics in that magnetic, hallucinatory way he mastered. I was struck by his craggy features, by turns tough and battle-hardened, weary but unbeaten, at moments ineffably sad beneath hooded eyes, but also full of an elemental life-force. He was surprisingly humble and modest, as though conscious of the disapproval towards him some might feel. Gradually any hostility melted away and felt ridiculous as the Doctor took us through his repertoire of piano-driven N’Orleans numbers. He was generous in crediting others, as when he performed pieces by his mentor, the great Professor Longhair, including an exquisite version of Tipitina and an anthem-like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. He completely won me over, and years later I was delighted to hear that he had finally kicked his heroin habit after years of struggle.
