Searing weather, storming live acts and spectacular array of talent around an arts and cultural programme that seemed to have something for everyone captivated crowds after a fallow year in 2018, but what was your highlight of the weekend? Whether your top moment came during a set on the main stages or when discovering a lesser known act elsewhere, or involves something away from music that surprised you around the site, we want to hear from you. Maybe you have a story about the people you met or art that you discovered (or anything else!) in the past few days, or perhaps there was a personal reason for a particular time being so special? Whether you are a veteran of the festival or first-timer you can contribute memories below. Get in touch by filling out the form – you can also include pictures or video with your submission. We’ll publish a selection of our favourite contributions as part of our coverage. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
