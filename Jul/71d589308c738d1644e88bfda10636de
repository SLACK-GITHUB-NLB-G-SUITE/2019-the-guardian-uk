The British pop star Ramz is “getting support” after posting images relating to suicide on his social media accounts. The 22-year-old rapper and singer from Mitcham, south London – real name Ramone Rochester – posted a disturbing image with the caption “Suicide”. The image has since been deleted from Twitter and Instagram, along with all other images from his Instagram account. They have been replaced with a message reading: “Thank you guys for all your messages. Ramz is in the right hands getting the support he needs. From Mum & Management”. Rochester broke through in 2017 with his track Barking, which went on to reach No 2 in the UK charts in January 2018. It was also a hit across Europe, especially in Germany, where it reached No 4. A follow up single later that year, Family Tree, reached No 35 in the UK. UK rappers including Wiley, Dappy, Ghetts and Chip all left messages of support for Rochester, the latter posting on Instagram: “Active Boyz all here for u my g ... football as per on your return. Be strong. You will be fine. I pray you’re ok fam. KEEP ’TRONG!!!” Rochester was due to perform at Splash festival in Germany this week, but has now been removed from the lineup. The Guardian has contacted his management for any further details. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
