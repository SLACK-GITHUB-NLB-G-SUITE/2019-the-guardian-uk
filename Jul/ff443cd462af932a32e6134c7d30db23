Mauricio Pochettino has admitted Tottenham face a nervous wait to discover the extent of Juan Foyth’s injury after the defender was carried off during the Audi Cup Final victory over Bayern Munich. Foyth came off the bench at half-time at the Allianz Arena but had to be withdrawn after appearing to suffer an ankle injury. Tottenham, who had led 2-0 thanks to goals from Érik Lamela and Christian Eriksen before being pegged back to 2-2 late on, went on to win the match 6-5 on penalties. But there was more concern afterwards about the Argentinian defender, who had been earmarked as a potential replacement for Kieran Trippier at right-back this season after the England defender joined Atlético Madrid. “I will have to see the doctor but as Foyth left the pitch he said, ‘Gaffer I have tweaked my ankle,’” admitted Pochettino afterwards. “We will have to see how bad it is.” Having seen off Real Madrid in the semi-final on Tuesday, a youthful Tottenham side fared well against their hosts until goals from the teenagers Jann-Fiete Arp and Alphonso Davies took the game to penalties. Jérôme Boateng’s miss eventually handed Pochettino’s side victory and the manager admitted he was pleased with the performances. “Always it is better to win a tournament than to lose it - whatever the circumstances,” he said. “I am very pleased with my players. We will take a lot of positives from this tournament. “It has not been easy for us after losing the Champions League Final. When something like that happens it’s hard to get on your feet. But we are all sportsmen and we all like to compete, so it’s up to us to find the motivation. I’m very happy.” Elsewhere Christian Pulisic scored his first Chelsea goals and Pedro produced a backheel volley as Frank Lampard’s side won 5-3 at Red Bull Salzburg and Arsenal beat the French side Angers on penalties after the game finished 1-1 in normal time.
