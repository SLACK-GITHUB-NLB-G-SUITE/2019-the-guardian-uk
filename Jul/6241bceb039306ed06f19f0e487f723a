Derby County have appointed the former Netherlands international Phillip Cocu as Frank Lampard’s managerial successor at Pride Park. Cocu, 48, has signed a four-year contract and will be joined by assistant manager Chris van der Weerden and specialist first-team coach Twan Scheepers. Derby’s head goalkeeping coach Shay Given will remain as part of the new-look coaching team. “I am pleased and honoured to confirm that Derby County will be my new club and can’t wait to meet with the team and the fans to start this adventure together,” Cocu told the club website. Lampard, who was named the new Chelsea manager this week, left Derby after leading them to the Championship play-off final in 2018-19, a game they lost 2-1 to Aston Villa. Cocu is the Rams’ seventh manager in four years and joins having previously won three Eredivisie titles as PSV Eindhoven boss between 2015 and 2018. His last senior post was in Turkey with Fenerbahce, but he lasted just four months and was sacked in October following one of the club’s worst starts to a season, where he won just three times in 15 games. Derby executive chairman Mel Morris said: “We are delighted to welcome Phillip Cocu as our new manager. We are continuing to develop our philosophy at Derby County and from the first conversation with Phillip, and his team, it was very clear they share similar views. The fit is strong. We want to build on the momentum that we have in our style of play, our club values, and the increasingly important role of our academy. Phillip and his team understand the need and benefits of this approach.” Derby’s new coaching staff have joined the first-team squad in Florida for a 10-day training camp with two friendly matches also scheduled. Former midfielder Cocu played for Barcelona and won 101 caps for Holland.
