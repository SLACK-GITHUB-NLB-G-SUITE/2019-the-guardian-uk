The Irish prime minister used official letterhead to write a fan letter to Kylie Minogue, freedom of information documents reveal. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar sent a handwritten message saying he was a “huge fan” of the Australian pop star, offering to meet her in person ahead of her Dublin concert in October last year. “Dear Kylie,” he wrote. “Just wanted to drop you a short note in advance of the concert in Dublin. I am really looking forward to it. Am a huge fan! “I understand you are staying in the Merrion hotel which is just across the street from my office in Government Buildings. If you like, I’d love to welcome you to Ireland personally.” The department of the Taoiseach twice blocked the freedom of information request from The Irish Mail on Sunday, before Varadkar consented to the information being made public.

Sadly, the Australian pop star had to cancel the October concert mentioned in Varadkar’s letter, due to a throat infection. But Minogue personally called him to apologise, and finally met with the leader at a rescheduled concert in December. Varadkar then had to deny accusations he had received a free meal at the concert. I've been made aware of a post on social media saying I had a free meal at a concert the other night. This is not true. There was no meal, we only had drinks and I paid. I have the receipt to prove it too. Varadkar also made international headlines last month when he brought his partner to meet with US vice president Mike Pence, and spoke against homophobia and LGBT discrimination.
