Keeping up with the frenetic pace of modern life is a tall order for any show, but one that Black Mirror has never struggled with. Since its launch in 2011, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones’s twisted anthology series has gained a reputation as TV’s most timely programme, a Twilight Zone for our tech-addled age. From artificial intelligence to social media pile-ons and the rise of populist politicians, Black Mirror has predicted many of our thoroughly modern moral panics before they came to pass. It has pushed technological boundaries of its own too, with recent interactive episode Bandersnatch allowing viewers to decide the fate of its characters with a push of a button. But where will Black Mirror go next? Brooker and Jones will be on hand to answer your questions on the show and the dark side of the digital era.
