1) It’s the Masters week at Augusta, and time once again to consider those devilishly tough putting greens. Last year’s winner, Patrick Reed, negotiated the final round with a score of 71 to stay one clear of a charging Rickie Fowler. Step back 30 years to watch Nick Faldo win the 1989 renewal by beating Scott Hoch in a play-off for his first of three Green Jackets. There has been no more dominant win in the Masters than Tiger Woods’ first attempt as a pro in 1997. The winningest at the Masters? Jack Nicklaus with six, his last coming as a 46-year-old in 1986. 2) Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s transcendental miss against Toulouse triggers memories of some of football’s greatest howlers. Steve Bruce goes on the charge but ends up embarrassing himself at Reading in 1996. Some classic Old Firm action here, with Peter van Vossen the culprit. Staying in Scotland, the unforgettable Chris Iwelumo and his miss against Norway in 2008. 3) From the ridiculous to the ridiculously lucky, Guadalajara under-17 player Diego Campillo scores a shootout penalty against Lobos BUAP in Mexico on Saturday. The Kolkata Knight Riders’ Chris Lynn somehow keeps his wicket when having leg stump smashed but the bails stay on. And was this luck or judgement from the Chicago Cubs’ Javier Báez? This, from South Korea’s Lee Nam-young, to win the final of the Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia, was definitely a piece of skill: So was this from Danilo Asprilla, in going the long way through Al-Taawon for Al-Fayha. And Wycombe’s manager, Gareth Ainsworth, has still got it, as he showed with this charity-match goal. Away from the sublime and back to the ridiculous, when the game gets dull, why not try a spot of fishing? This fan came equipped to watch Serie D side Reggio Audace. 4) Into the referees’ room: a Colombian official calls for VAR when there isn’t actually any VAR. How VAR actually works, from the A-League. And a proposal of marriage from one assistant to the other in Romanian football. Spoiler: she said yes. 5) Tara Moore was 0-6, 0-5 down facing match point. It’s about as far behind in sport that you can get. Then she came back … and won. Lololol 🙂🙃🙂🙃 never in doubt #dontcallitacomeback 6) The occasionally under-rated former England batsman Ian Bell turns 37 on Thursday, so let’s enjoy some choice blows from the Sledgehammer of Eternal Justice. There’s his Test best 235 against India in 2011, Bell putting the “Shermanator” jibes to bed with his first century against Australia at Sydney earlier in the same year, his Ashes showreel plus that run-out controversy at Trent Bridge eight years ago. 1) A 54 minute analysis of the 46,000+ punts in NFL history to determine the saddest punt of all time. 2) Own-goal corner: Ajax defender Nicolás Tagliafico scores a comical OG during his side’s 5-2 win over FC Emmen. 3) Another for the backside assist files, with Ismaël Diakité of Mauritania the beneficiary against Burkina Faso.
