How insidiously certain words inveigle themselves into everyday discourse. Take “hub”, which in my day meant the centre of a wheel. No longer. Just consider these from recent press reports: “Cromer tennis club member slams ‘toffs of north Norfolk’ over £3.3m sports hub plans”; “Shiseido opens $360m research hub in Japan to spur creativity and collaboration”; “‘Scandalous waste’: Council spent £5m on business hub worth £2m”; “Anger over claims that new bus hub that ‘threatens local businesses’ is for ‘greater good’”; “Jack Sargeant AM gathers cross-party support for Heathrow Logistics Hub bid”. I know I’m somewhat out of step with the modern world, but wouldn’t the word “centre” suffice? Mind you, none of the above comes close to my favourite, which is a sign (and don’t get me started on “signage”) at Haslemere station, in Surrey. “Cycle hub”, which, loosely translated, means bike sheds. And then there’s “uptick”. “Gear4Music posts 2nd profit warning despite sales uptick”; “Uptick in collisions leads to Scott’s Law crackdown”; “Prescott Police Say They Have Seen An Uptick In Scam Calls Recently”. Wouldn’t “rise” do? What, exactly, is the difference between an uptick and a spike? As in “What’s Behind the Murder Spike in Brooklyn?”; “Weekly mortgage refinances spike 39% after huge rate drop”; “Trump’s Border Threats Have Likely Prompted A Spike In Avocado Prices”. Think these all probably mean rise as well. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must dash – I have a very important assignment underneath the clock at Waterloo station transport hub and let’s hope there’s an uptick in South Western Railway’s punctuality. •Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist
