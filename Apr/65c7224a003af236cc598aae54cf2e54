The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has apologised after a photo was circulated showing her drinking a mojito on public transport in London. The Labour frontbencher said on Twitter: “A photo of me drinking from a can of M&S mojito on the Overground has been circulated. I’m sincerely sorry for drinking on TfL.” She sent the tweet after the photograph was published in the Sun, and she received widespread support, with many people saying she should not have to apologise. The therapist and writer Philippa Perry said: “Oh mate. We’ve all done it. Anyway thanks for travelling on the tube like most people have to do.” While the Labour MP David Lammy said: “Jah Rastafari! Why was the rum not Jamaican?” A mental health campaigner, Sam Thomas, said: “Why should you be sorry? We are all free to the freedom of choice. If you choose to drink on the underground, it’s fine. Meanwhile, for the serious crime that it isn’t, far worse atrocities are being committed.” One person wrote: “I’ve never felt more represented,” while another said: “Babe, live your life”. The Sun reported that Abbott was “slammed” for drinking alcohol on the tube, which is illegal. It reported that one commuter saw Abbott drinking at 1pm, keeping her head down and staring at her mobile phone. Rules introduced in 2008 state that drinking is not allowed on buses or tubes run by Transport for London. The Conservative MP Boris Johnson was responsible for bringing in the ban when he was mayor. At the time, Johnson said: “I firmly believe that banning the drinking of alcohol on London’s public transport will create a better travelling environment for all Londoners.”
