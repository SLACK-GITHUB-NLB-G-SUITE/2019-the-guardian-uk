Trim the dark green florets from a 500g broccoli and set aside. Thinly slice the stalks then sauté them in 30g of butter for 3 or 4 minutes until bright and translucent, then add the florets and continue cooking for 3 or 4 minutes until they are tender. Add salt and pepper and 250ml of double cream and bring to the boil. The plaice cooks in 3 or 4 minutes, which is just enough time for the broccoli to settle Get an overhead grill hot. Gently, without breaking the florets, fold in 60g of grated Parmesan then spoon into 2 small, oven-proof dishes. Cook under the heated grill for 4 or 5 minutes until golden and bubbling, then serve with the grilled plaice below. Place 2 fillets of plaice skin-side down on a foil-covered baking sheet. Melt 30g of butter in a small pan and season with salt and a little pepper. Spoon the butter over the fish. Cook under the overhead grill for 3 or 4 minutes, until the fish is patchily golden and tender enough to cut with a fork. Serve with the creamed broccoli. Enough for 2. Cook the broccoli first, then the plaice. The plaice cooks very quickly, in just 3 or 4 minutes, which is just enough time for the broccoli to settle. The stalks should be cooked first, then the florets, as they are tougher and need a few minutes longer. Slice even the thickest stalk no thicker than a £1 coin. Use mushroom instead of broccoli. Slice chestnut mushrooms thinly and cook in a little butter until golden. Then add the cream and grated Parmesan as above. A little garlic, sautéed with the broccoli stalks or mushrooms, is a good idea, as is the inclusion of a little chopped tarragon, added at the same time as the florets.
