Monty Python’s Argument Sketch is hard to beat. The dictionary. I really like the sample sentences. I often wonder: “Why this sentence?” That would have to be my entire family’s reaction to my pursuit of standup comedy as a career. It wasn’t so funny to me at the time, but now, as a prolonged, dull, aching heckle, I find it very funny. My father showed me the Pink Panther films when I was pretty young. I loved them, especially The Pink Panther Strikes Again. I think Peter Sellers was a genius. [Actor and comic] Albert Brooks. I probably laugh the most around him. He really is uniquely funny. Looking or smelling? This would be a tie between all of the ones that have not almost killed me; I have life-threatening food allergies. You tell me. I find infinity to be very funny. Maybe because of how it looks – like a pair of goggles or a bikini top. Demetri Martin is on tour in the UK, 14 to 18 April; starts Dublin
