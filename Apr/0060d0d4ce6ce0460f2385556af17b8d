Pep Guardiola has called on his Manchester City players to finish the season with three more victories after watching them win 2-0 against Manchester United to move into a position of strength at the top of the Premier League table. City are now a point ahead of Liverpool with three games to go after second-half goals from Bernardo Silva and Leroy Sané extended United’s run to seven defeats from their last nine games, their worst sequence of results since 1962. “I told the players: ‘don’t read [the newspapers] tomorrow, don’t watch the television, just rest, sleep a lot and go in there against Burnley,” Guardiola said, referring to Sunday’s trip to Turf Moor. “I don’t think Liverpool are going to drop too many points, but it’s in our hands – three games. We won the last 11 [in the league]. It’s incredible what these players have done so far, but still we have a job to do. “Maybe tonight we can enjoy it, but tomorrow it’s over, it’s gone, so we have to be focused. I know people are going to talk about how beautiful we are, how handsome we are, like this, like that, but now we have to go to Burnley - and in my two previous seasons going to Burnley was incredibly tough. If we win our last three games, we are champions and that is what we are going to try to do.” United’s performance drew criticism from Marcus Rashford – “We didn’t play like Manchester United,” the striker said – on a night when their former captain, Roy Keane, used his punditry role to castigate the current players, picking out Paul Pogba for particular criticism and talking about the “bluffers” in Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s dressing-room. “They [City] have set the standard,” Solskjær said. “For the last couple of seasons they have been the best team in the league. That’s the challenge for us to get to and we’re clearly not there now. That’s for everyone to see. That’s my job, when we come back in pre-season, to make sure we have the right characters around.”
