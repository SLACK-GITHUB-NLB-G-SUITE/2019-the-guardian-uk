At least twenty-eight people have died after a tourist bus overturned on the Portuguese island of Madeira, local media have reported. The victims were mostly German, the mayor of Caniço, the coastal town in the south of the island where the accident happened, told SIC Television. “I have no words to describe what happened. I cannot face the suffering of these people,” Filipe Sousa said, adding that the victims included 17 women and 11 men. A further 21 people were injured. A battered white bus on its side surrounded by firefighters could be seen in photos published by Portuguese media, while SIC said there were 19 ambulances at the scene following the accident, which occurred around 5.30pm GMT. The coach was reportedly carrying 57 passengers when it veered off a road on a bend east of the capital, Funchal, before rolling down a steep hillside, Sousa said. The Portuguese guide and driver reportedly survived the accident, and they along with a number of other wounded people were taken to hospital in Funchal. A spokeswoman for the hospital told German newspaper Bild: “We currently have our hands full. We have many injured people from the bus accident here. The ambulances drove them from Santa Cruz to us. Many are very badly injured.” It was not clear whether the fatalities were confined to the bus passengers, and authorities are investigating the possible cause. Locals reported that the weather was fine at the time of the accident, which happened in daylight. A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: “We are seeking information from the authorities in Portugal about a bus crash in Madeira, and are ready to support any British people who require assistance.” The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is reportedly travelling to Funchal tonight to visit the scene. Madeira is about 600 miles south-west of Portugal. Five Italian tourists died in São Vicente, on the northern coast of Madeira, in a fatal bus crash in 2005.
