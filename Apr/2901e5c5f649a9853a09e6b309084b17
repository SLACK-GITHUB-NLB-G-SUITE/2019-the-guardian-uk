Environmental campaigners under the banner of Extinction Rebellion (XR) are planning their latest mobilisation in a fight for awareness and action over human destruction of the environment. In November last year thousands of people massed in London to block bridges in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades. Organisers are inviting people to attend similar events in the coming week, including blocking traffic in key sites across the capital beginning on the morning of 15 April. The movement has grown rapidly and now claims to have over 300 groups in 49 countries – a map on its website shows groups across continents from Seattle to Sao Paulo and branches from nations such as South Korea, India, Burkina Faso, Israel and Colombia.
