I have had challenges reclaiming deposits from SodaStream. If you pay a £10 deposit for an online order of a gas cartridge they commit you’ll get it back when you return it empty for recycling. However, on four occasions I have had to chase and in three cases they insisted they did not owe me anything. The latest wrangle went on for several weeks. I use SodaStream to avoid using plastic bottles of sparkling water. But all this hassle is leaving a nasty taste. RZ, Arundel, West Sussex We wonder if SodaStream is struggling to cope with all the new business triggered by the backlash against single-use plastic water bottles. It’s odd it offers an incentive to encourage recycling and then customers have to jump through hoops to get their money back. It says: “We have a dedicated, UK-based team to answer customer inquiries. We aim to respond within two working days though, on occasion, we don’t provide the level of service we aspire to.
