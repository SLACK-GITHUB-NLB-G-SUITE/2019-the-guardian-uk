Former UFC fighter Rodrigo de Lima was killed on Sunday following a dispute with an rideshare driver, according to one of his friends. According to authorities in the Brazilian city of Belém, De Lima argued with the driver of the car. After De Lima exited the vehicle, the driver allegedly ran over and killed the 26-year-old. Police are searching for the suspect. De Lima’s friend and fellow UFC fighter, Michel Prazeres, was with him at the time, and confirmed the father of two had died. De Lima’s nickname was “Monstro” and he had a 9-3-1 record in mixed martial arts. He fought twice in UFC, losing both bouts to Neil Magny and Efrain Escudero respectively. His last MMA fight came last year, when he beat Luiz Fabiano by submission.
