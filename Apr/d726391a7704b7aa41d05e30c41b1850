The Grantchester actor Emma Corrin has been cast as Diana, Princess of Wales in the fourth season of the critically acclaimed series The Crown after she “immediately captivated” casting directors. Netflix confirmed the decision in a tweet, adding that filming for the latest season would begin this year. Corrin said she was “beyond excited and honoured”. She said: “I have been glued to the show since the first episode and to think I’m now joining this incredibly talented acting family is just surreal. Princess Diana was an icon, and her effect on the world remains profound and inspiring. To be given the chance to explore her through Peter Morgan’s writing is the most exceptional opportunity, and I will strive to do her justice.” She joins a cast including Olivia Colman who replaces Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third series, to be screened later this year, and Helena Bonham Carter who is to play Princess Margaret. The series creator Morgan said: “Emma is a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us all when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer. As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.” The second series of The Crown took five Emmy awards, including best actress for Foy and best director for a drama for Stephen Daldry. Diana was married to the Prince of Wales from 1981 to 1996. She died in Paris in a car crash in 1997. She was famed for her advocacy of charitable causes, including her work to tackle HIV and Aids.
