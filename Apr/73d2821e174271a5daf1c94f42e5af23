Defi Du Seuil may try to take advantage of Altior’s stepping up in distance in the autumn, when Philip Hobbs’s speedy chaser could be given a tilt at the Tingle Creek and other top-class two-mile races. That, at least, is in the minds of connections as Defi Du Seuil goes to Punchestown this week, where he will have one of the best chances of any British raider at the week-long festival. The question of Defi Du Seuil’s ideal distance was repeatedly discussed during the season which has just ended but he seemed to answer it by winning the JLT Novice Chase over two and a half miles at last month’s Cheltenham Festival. But there is no equivalent contest at Punchestown and connections have opted to step down in distance rather than up. “We’ll get a better idea what we might be doing for next season,” said Hobbs, who admitted that the vacancy left by Altior makes the two-mile division potentially tempting, at least for the autumn, when Sandown’s Tingle Creek might be quite an open contest. “Most Triumph Hurdle winners end up wanting three miles but he’s got plenty of pace. He’ll give us an idea where we go.” Hobbs has won a dozen races at the Punchestown Festival, including the Ryanair. Defi Du Seuil is currently 11-4 for Thursday’s race, in which he will be ridden by Richard Johnson for the first time in more than a year, Barry Geraghty having broken his leg. Buveur D’Air, another high-profile British raider at Punchestown this week, is 15-8 favourite for Friday’s Champion Hurdle. His trainer, Nicky Henderson, sends a strong team, including the unbeaten Champagne Platinum in a Grade One novice hurdle on Tuesday. Henderson will also give Chantry House his hurdling debut at Punchestown, while Saturday’s card will see the return to action of the trainer’s Fusil Raffles, last seen hacking up in the Adonis but tearing the skin off a leg so badly during the Kempton contest that he had to miss Cheltenham. Meanwhile, 24 horses remain entered for Saturday’s 2,000 Guineas, which has a very open look after the withdrawal of five leading contenders in recent weeks. Godolphin paid £30,000 to add Al Hilalee to the race on Monday. Charlie Appleby’s unbeaten colt appears to be more of a Derby type but evidently impressed in a racecourse gallop at Meydan nine days ago. Punchestown’s Festival meeting is undoubtedly the highlight of the next few days from a betting perspective with many of the biggest stars in action, but as attention in Britain turns to the Flat there are a few runners worth close inspection on today’s five domestic cards. All three of Monday afternoon’s meetings, oddly, are on the all-weather and the turf does not get a look-in until Windsor kicks off its hugely popular programme of Monday evening meetings at 4.55. Katheefa (4.15) was a bit below form last time out but has a big chance returning to the Fibresand at Southwell where he was a ready winner earlier in the month. Archive (3.20) is now a nine-year-old but arrives at Newcastle in the form of his life after two wins off a mark of 69 in recent weeks and can race off a lower all-weather mark of 67, while Willkommen (3.00) and Pentland Lad (4.55) should both run well at Wolverhampton and Windsor, respectively.
