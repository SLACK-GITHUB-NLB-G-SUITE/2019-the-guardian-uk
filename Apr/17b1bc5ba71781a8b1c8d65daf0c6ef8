A 10-year-old boy has died after being attacked by a dog at a caravan park. The boy, who has not been named, was found dead by police at the scene following the attack by the dog, described as a “bulldog-type breed”. Devon and Cornwall police launched a search for the dog owner and her pet following the incident, arresting a woman in Saltash in south-east Cornwall just after 8am on Saturday. Police said a 28-year-old woman was in custody in relation to the attack at the Tencreek holiday park in Looe, Cornwall, at about 5am on Saturday. The woman is being held on suspicion of having a dog dangerously out of control and manslaughter. The dog was also found and has been transferred to kennels. South Western ambulance service said paramedics were sent to the park at 04:42. Holiday park manager Robert Ellwood said police had not given him any information about what had happened. “I arrived this morning and police were already on site,” he said. “Due to the amount of police we knew it would be something major but we have not been told anything.”
