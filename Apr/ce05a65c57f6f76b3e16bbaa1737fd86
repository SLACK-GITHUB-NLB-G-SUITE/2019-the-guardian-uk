A softness permeates the music of classically trained cellist and songwriter Kelsey Lu. Not the softness of background muzak or meditative introspection, but a concentrated, purposeful mood – one teased out by billowing melodies, bowed beneath her crystalline vocals. After dropping out of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and moving to New York to record her one-take debut EP, Church, in 2016, there has been a buzz of anticipation surrounding Lu’s compositions. Where Church seemed to absorb its ecclesiastical surroundings in the eerie, incantatory feel of her solo playing – looped to surround her vocals – the arrival of her debut LP marks Lu out as a formidable singer and songwriter, as much as a composer. The clarity of her vocal lines on Atlantic and Rebel bring to mind Lu’s previous collaborator Solange, while the influence of another – Blood Orange – is felt in the off-kilter folk strings of Pushin Against the Wind. Yet Lu transcends collaborator status, moving into fully fledged pop-auteur territory on Due West, while seamlessly swerving into the confessional realm on Why Knock for You. Blood is an enticingly restrained debut, showing a consistency of tone without compromising on Lu’s inventiveness. She hints at a wider orchestration in her compositions, bringing in sweeping strings or rumblings of percussion while never pushing them into a maximal blast. The balance lends her softness the punchiness that makes Blood so captivating.
