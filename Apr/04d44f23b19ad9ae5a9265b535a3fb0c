As pressure builds on Labour’s NEC to endorse a confirmatory referendum in its European election manifesto (Explainer: What’s happening on Thursday, 29 April) too little thought is being given to what the referendum question should be. Yet this issue is crucial to achieving a settled outcome on which national reconciliation and reform can be built. The desire of each side of the Brexit argument to achieve its preferred outcome has led to the current impasse and obscured the importance of achieving the right process. The issue of Brexit can only be laid to rest by a process which can command the acceptance of a significant proportion of UK citizens – otherwise we are doomed to rerun it again and again. Four principles should underpin this process – it must involve the people, because only a people’s vote can supplant the 2016 referendum result; it must allow most people to feel that their preferred option has been properly considered; it must lead to an outcome that can be enacted forthwith, avoiding further painful wrangling; and it must be decisive. A people’s vote with the only three immediately implementable options on the ballot paper – remain in the EU, May’s withdrawal agreement and leave with no deal – conducted using preferential voting (1,2,3) and with a threshold of 60% on the first count meets these requirements. This is what Labour, and all those who want to see the UK move on from Brexit, should not only campaign on but enact through legislation as soon as possible.Dr Gregory ConnorChesterfield, Derbyshire • If there are two chief reasons why Labour members supported a new leadership four years ago, it was surely that, firstly, power was often seen to be being pursued at the expense of principle and, secondly, that the views of its members were no longer being listened to, in spite of much vaunted consultation processes. The prospect of Labour going into the European elections with a manifesto that fudges or denies the promise of a confirmatory referendum (Labour hints at backing Brexit deal without a new vote promise, 29 April) against the wishes of the majority of its membership, in order to placate its leave-voting heartlands (where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party will no doubt inflict damage anyway) risks a mass party exodus on a scale not seen since the invasion of Iraq. Better to stick to its principles, retain the support of a younger pro-European generation, and use a general election to expose the policy deficiencies of the single-issue Brexit party to the electorate.Paul DolanCheshire • In recent weeks I have been attempting, through personal contact and local networking sites, to get as many EU citizens as possible to register to vote here in the European elections. As they are sometimes unclear about how to vote to register their remain or second referendum sympathies, I have had to point out that the Greens, Lib Dems and Change UK are the only unequivocally remain parties on offer. As a Labour party member, I have added, more in hope than expectation, that Labour too could yet come out clearly for a confirmatory vote in their manifesto. But if Labour fails to include a firm commitment which respects the wishes of the vast majority of its members then I shall advise local EU citizens to take their votes elsewhere as I, and millions of others, will be doing. Though advocating a vote for other parties lays me open to expulsion from the party this is an eventuality which, after three years of frustration at Labour’s utter lack of direction on the domestic issue of the age, would conveniently save me the trouble of resigning.Mike HineKingston upon Thames • England is in a mess (Scotland’s case for splitting away is easier to make than ever, 29 April) and as a Labour party member residing in Wales, let me be clear to the leadership; I am a European socialist foremost and, as Plaid Cymru calls for a referendum on EU membership, let me be clear to the NEC and Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has to offer the people and above all our young people a clear mandate on a second referendum; if not, for many in Wales our European identity will lie in Welsh independence within Europe. Corbyn needs to find some clarity that the Labour party has to preserve the British state if it wishes for government, for it is Celtic fringe MPs that are crucial to his bid for power.Peter HackPresteigne, Powys • There are two simple messages for Labour leavers in the deprived north: your trials and tribulations are not the fault of the EU but of the disastrous austerity policies of the Tory government. And second: if we leave the EU, your economic blight will be made worse, not better. If only Mr Corbyn could be persuaded to proclaim these truths, loud and clear, the Labour party need have no hesitation in endorsing a second referendum.Michael FranklinBarnet, London • As Labour members and trade unionists, we urge our party to embrace the European elections as an opportunity to promote socialist politics in Britain and across Europe. This should include an explicit commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal, with an option to remain. We want policies for a radical transformation of Britain and Europe. This could include: an end to austerity, and restoration and levelling up of services across Europe; an international green new deal to allow an emergency, socially just climate transition plan; defence of free movement combined with a European migration policy that welcomes migrants; and a radical strengthening of workers’ and trade union rights; and a coordinated crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion; a major expansion of public ownership, including of the banks and finance; an overhaul of trade and other policies to promote workers’ rights, sustainability and redistribution; a ban on nuclear weapons; and further democratisation of EU institutions, including a strengthened European parliament. We want MEPs who will use their voices, from the platform of the European parliament and outside, to popularise socialist policies and support and help organise workers’, migrants’ and other social struggles – locally, nationally and internationally. Our Labour party, with its half a million members, can make a huge difference in these elections, challenging both the far right and a discredited neoliberal establishment.Julie Ward MEP, North West
