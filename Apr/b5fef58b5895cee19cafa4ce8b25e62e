I had UPVC windows and doors fitted by Safestyle UK over a year ago. Since then I have needed to ask for several visits to rectify manufacturing and fitting faults and, 12 months later, Safestyle agreed to replace two sets of window frames. During the installation I was informed that these were also faulty and would need to be replaced and I was given a date two and a half months away. I’m left with a gap so wide in one of the windows that I’ve had to seal it with tape. Safestyle UK does not respond to emails or contact via its webform, callers are held for up to an hour and letters just receive a generic acknowledgment. PL, London Safestyle UK boasts of being the “No 1 installer of windows” and promises quality and expertise on its website. Communications are another matter. Only when I got in touch did it reveal that your replacement windows were, in fact, ready and that it would be in touch as a matter of “urgency” to arrange installation. Urgency in Safestyle’s lexicon turned out to mean a further 18 days and two chasers from me before it called you. An installation date was agreed, but incredibly the replacement windows were also faulty. A further three weeks of chasing passed before yet another installation date was agreed – 15 months after the original fitting the job was finally completed. Safestyle says: “We are sorry to hear of the customer’s experience, which fell below our usual high standards, and apologise for any inconvenience.” As for compensation, the firm has offered you £150, which you reject as derisory. Compensation levels are a grey area which consumer law does not address and you would have to take your case to the arbitration service CEDR to try for an increase.
