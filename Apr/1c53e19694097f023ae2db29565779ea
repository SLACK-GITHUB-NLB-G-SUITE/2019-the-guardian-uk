Indian actor. Hollywood star. Celebrity chef. Octogenarian rapper? Madhur Jaffrey is surprising old fans and winning new ones with her latest guise as a grandma MC in a music video for a New York-based rapper. The Delhi-born actor, who trained at London’s Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts, then published a series of influential cookbooks, stars in the film clip for the track Nani – Hindi for maternal grandmother – by the hip-hop artist Mr Cardamom. “I’m the best damn nani that you ever done see,” she tells her son, after he berates her for neglecting her grandmotherly duties. “Fuck top five nanis and fuck top three, I’m the number one nani, don’t fuck with me.” Jaffrey, who is “85 years gold”, is credited as instrumental in demystifying Indian food for Americans and Brits with the publication of her 1973 cookbook, An Invitation to Indian Cooking, which along with a series of cooking programmes, helped to popularise some of the subcontinent’s cuisines. She first gained fame in the west for her award-winning performance in the 1965 film, Shakespeare Wallah, and most recently starred in the NBC sitcom, I Feel Bad, that is currently awaiting renewal. Clips from both her cooking shows and her films are spliced into the clip, as Jaffrey, in a yellow beret, roams New York demanding imperious treatment from waiters and slapping down men who dare to reach for the same vegetables in the grocery aisle. Zohran Mamdani, the real name of rapper Mr Cardamom, told the New York Times the song is a tribute to his grandmother, Praveen Nair, who was a social worker in Delhi and the founder of a trust that assists homeless children. He told the news outlet that Jaffrey, whose latest cookbook will be published in May, refused to accept payment, but insisted on keeping the yellow beret.
