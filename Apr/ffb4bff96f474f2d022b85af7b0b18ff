Have your family worked for or owned a business for generations? We’d like to know about the challenges and highlights of being part of a business that has been influenced by generations of your family. Perhaps you currently work for the family business, or are planning to go into it at a later date? Or maybe you’ve inherited a family enterprise that involves a craft or skill that is now a rarity and you want to keep it going, or even modernise it. Do you and other family members agree on the direction of your work or has there been friction? Alternatively, if you’re preparing to hand over your business or skill to a future generation, or if you would like to do so but don’t have anyone in your family who is able or willing to take over, we’d like to know about that too. No matter your age or the nature of your work, we’d like to hear from you and, if possible, from other generations of your family.
