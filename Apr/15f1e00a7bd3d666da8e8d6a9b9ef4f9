With 40 million fewer birds today than in 1966 (Report, 29 April), the UK is one of the most nature-deprived countries in the world. Nature is falling silent, and the impact on our environment, culture, health and happiness should not be underestimated. Nature’s influence runs through the fabric of our culture, its creations woven into myth and legend. Birds in particular have been revered in every age. From the Bard to the Beatles and Elgar to Emin, birds have inspired works of music, art, the written and spoken word, while naturalists from Darwin to Attenborough have shared the lives of these remarkable creatures with us, ensuring their status as national treasures for eternity. Nature is written into our DNA; we are part of it. All of us benefit from taking time to pause and reconnect with the natural world. As creatives, nature is our muse, fuelling our imagination and guiding our paintbrush, pen and camera lens. But nature is in crisis. It hasn’t been prioritised in political decision-making, and now we are paying the price. The next two years will be critical: in 2020, world leaders will meet in Beijing at a global summit to save nature. We call on the UK government to play a world-leading role in nature’s recovery. We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do so. This Sunday marks International Dawn Chorus Day, the perfect time to enjoy the feathered orchestra outside your window. You might be lucky enough to hear the vocal acrobatics of the nightingale, the soaring song of the skylark or the blackbird’s beautiful solo. Nature’s extraordinary wake-up call should set alarm bells ringing for all of us. If we don’t want to lose it, we need to act now – before it’s too late, and let nature sing. In the words of Shelley’s To a Skylark: “The world should listen then, as I am listening now.” Ackroyd & Harvey ArtistsAlison Steadman ActorAlison Tickell Director, Julie’s BicycleAndrew Kötting Artist and film-makerAnn Cleeves WriterAnoushka Shankar Sitar player and composerAxel Scheffler IllustratorBen Rivers ArtistBill Oddie Naturalist, conservationist, TV presenter, writer, songwriter, musicianBrian Blessed ActorBrian Briggs Singer-songwriter and conservationistCarol Ann Duffy PoetCatrin Finch Harpist, arranger and composerCharlotte Mendelson NovelistChris Packham Broadcaster and campaignerCorinne Bailey Rae Singer-songwriterCornelia Parker ArtistCrissie Rhodes Singer-songwriter and member of The ShiresDavid Arnold Film composerDavid Domoney Horticulturist and broadcasterDeborah Borg Brincat Singer-songwriter and member of BerneDr Lori Watson Musician/lecturer (University of Edinburgh)Ed O’Brien Guitarist, singer-songwriter and member of RadioheadELIZA MusicianEmily Portman Singer, songwriter and musicianEurielle Singer-songwriterEvelyn Glennie Solo percussionistFran Healy Singer-songwriter and member of TravisGary Hume ArtistGrayson Perry Artist and film-makerHazell Dean Singer, songwriter and producerIan McEwan Novelist and screenwriterInbali Iserles Writer and animal loverJackie Kay Poet and authorJackie Morris Artist, writer, motherJeremy Deller ArtistJeremy Pritchard Everything EverythingJimi Goodwin Singer, songwriter and musicianJoan Armatrading Singer, songwriter, producerJoe Harkness WriterJoe Pasquale ComedianJulie Fowlis Folk singer and multi-instrumentalistKaren Maitland AuthorKate Mosse NovelistKathy Lette AuthorKitty Macfarlane Singer, songwriter and guitaristLemar Singer-songwriter and producerLucie Caswell CEO, Featured Artists CoalitionLucy Pullin Singer-songwriterMarcus Coates ArtistMarina Lewycka AuthorMarina Warner WriterMartin Noble Guitarist and member of British Sea PowerMartin Parr PhotographerMatt Merritt Editor, Bird Watching MagazineMike Clarke CEO of the RSPBMike Dilger Naturalist and broadcasterMike Rosenberg aka Passenger Singer-songwriter and musicianMiranda Krestofnikoff Presenter, diver, author and president of the RSPBNeil Gaiman AuthorNick Mason Drummer and member of Pink FloydNick Mulvey Singer-songwriter and musicianOlivia Chaney Folk singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalistPatrick Barkham Writer and journalistRobert Macfarlane AuthorRoxanne de Bastion Singer-songwriterRumer Shirakbari Singer-songwriterSam Lee Folk singer and nature conservationistSam Sweeney Folk musicianSamson Kambalu ArtistSandie Shaw SingerSeb Rochford Composer, drummer, producer and member of Polar BearSeth Lakeman Singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalistShaun Keaveny BroadcasterShirley Collins Folk singerAntony Gormley SculptorStephen Moss Nature writer, broadcaster and producerStuart Semple Artist and curator
