Is Roger Scruton a victim or villain? From interviews on Radio 4’s Today programme to editorials in the Times, the debate over the conservative philosopher shows little sign of diminishing. For those who have not followed the episode, Scruton was recently interviewed by the New Statesman’s George Eaton. The magazine published a version of the interview, from which Eaton tweeted some damning quotes – Scruton seemingly racist about the Chinese, antisemitic about George Soros and bigoted about Muslims. He was sacked from a government advisory post. Scruton’s supporters claimed he had been misrepresented and traduced. The Spectator, the New Statesman’s rightwing weekly rival, obtained a copy of the interview tape, parts of which were broadcast on Today, during an interview with Scruton. Finally, on Friday, the New Statesman published the full transcript of the interview. It does not shown Eaton in a good light. The published interview, I suggested last week, read as if it “had been conducted for the purposes of eliciting the quotes”. Reading the full transcript only confirms that suspicion. Some have defended Eaton on the grounds that Scruton’s beliefs on immigration and Muslims are appalling and need challenging. I have long been a critic of Scruton’s views. But their obnoxiousness is no reason to misrepresent him. An interview, especially with someone with whom you disagree, needs to be handled not just with care but with a degree of generosity, too. Reducing it to a “Gotcha” moment only makes it harder to challenge their ideas. The debate over the past week has been less about Scruton’s views than about journalistic ethics. In political journalism, taking sides is inevitable. It is precisely when one is most politically engaged, however, that one has to be particularly careful about the lines that one does not cross. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist
