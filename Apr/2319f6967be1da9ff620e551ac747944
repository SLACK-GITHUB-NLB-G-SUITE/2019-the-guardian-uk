The past year has seen two of the most powerful youth protest movements in decades. When 16-year-old Greta Thunberg started a school strike calling for climate action, she sparked a global campaign – now more than 1.4 million schoolchildren have taken part in strikes. Last March, young people in the US rallied together in March for Our Lives after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, making it one of the biggest youth protests in the country’s history. We want to hear about other movements led by young people. Tell us if you are part of, or know, a youth-led protest movement or campaign.
