Here in Wales, it isn’t only subtitles that risk being mistranslated (G2, 26 April; Letters, 29 April). As it is a legal requirement that all road signs be bilingual, the capacity for disaster is increased. My favourite dates to 2008, when Swansea council’s injudicious use of their in-house translation service produced a road sign which read, in English: “No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only.” The Welsh version read: “I am not in the office at present. Send any work to be translated.” Fiona CollinsCarrog, Denbighshire • I hope Tigger didn’t start the Ashdown Forest fire (Forty acres of forest that was home to Winnie-the-Pooh ravaged by fire, 30 April). He must be pretty pissed off by his appropriation for political purposes by Heidi Allen (“Tiggers – we are go!”). Could he be the gilet jaune of the Hundred Acre Wood?Jonathan TaylorFowey, Cornwall • Robert Bracegirdle says the Great Central Railway’s main line (Marylebone-Sheffield) was built to “continental loading gauge” (Letters, 19 April). Although it was built to a larger-than-usual loading gauge for Britain, it would not accommodate a French TGV or a German ICE train.Peter JohnsonLeicester • “UK graduates with more education than that required for their job” (Report, 30 April)? And there was I thinking that education enhanced personal development.Audrey ButlerCheadle, Greater Manchester • I’m 54 and the only place I’ve been aware of disgust at female armpit hair is in the media (G2, 30 April).Robert CullenGothenburg, Sweden • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
