As the last Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared from Waterloo Bridge on Sunday night, many moved on to sites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, marking a week-long occupation in London mirrored in 33 other countries. The protests have been met with both resounding support and disapproval. Still, millions of people have now heard their call for transformative and urgent change to avoid climate catastrophe. It’s a message echoed by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, who is speaking in parliament on Tuesday, and the young people across the world who continue to strike from school each Friday. The climate conversation has now gone mainstream; earlier in the week the BBC aired a primetime documentary from David Attenborough, Climate Change: The Facts, while Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. It feels as though the message about the climate emergency is being pushed further than ever before. We want to know how you have been affected by this movement in the UK.
