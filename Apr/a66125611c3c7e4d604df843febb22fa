Callum Hudson-Odoi has confirmed he ruptured his achilles during Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Burnley on Monday night. He is expected to be out for some time. Hudson-Odoi was replaced in the 41st minute at Stamford Bridge and is now set to miss England’s Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands in June.
