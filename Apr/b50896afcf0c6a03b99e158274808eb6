Skardu, running for only the second time in his career, quickened impressively from off the pace to take Newmarket’s Craven Stakes on Wednesday and move towards the head of the betting for the 2,000 Guineas on 4 May. An equally significant shift in the Classic market, though, possibly involved the long-term favourite, Too Darn Hot, who is now on offer at 4-1 for the Guineas having been as short as 10-11 earlier this month. Too Darn Hot, who was found to have heat in a splint bone last week, has not been as big as 4-1 for the first Classic of the season since shortly before his impressive win in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in mid-September last year. He subsequently earned the highest rating for a juvenile colt since Frankel in 2010 in the annual classification but could be scratched from the Guineas as early as this weekend if John Gosden, his trainer, feels the colt’s injury has left insufficient time to get him ready. Paddy Power pushed Too Darn Hot out to 4-1 for the Classic, while simultaneously cutting Skardu from 20-1 to 6-1 after he had beaten the 28-1 chance Momkin by a neck with Set Piece, at 14-1, nearly two lengths away in third. Royal Marine, the 13-8 favourite, struggled for running room for much of the race and finished fourth, while Zakouski, another runner in Godolphin blue, was close behind in fifth. “He had a nice race, relaxed well and showed a nice turn of foot,” William Haggas, Skardu’s trainer, said. “He’s done really well today. He’s gone from a maiden to a Group Three, so hopefully there’s a bit more in him. We can get a bit excited, I think. “James [Doyle, Skardu’s jockey] knows [Zakouski] very well and says he’s a smart horse, though he obviously didn’t run his race today. He said he had to take a pull three out. He’s in the fast lane, because he’s got a lot to learn, but I can’t fault him at the moment.” Newmarket 1.50 Franz Kafka 2.25 Strong Power 3.00 Almufti 3.35 Beringer (nap) 4.10 Zabeel Prince 4.45 On The Warpath (nb) 5.20 Ornate Cheltenham 2.05 The Cull Bank 2.40 Graceful Legend 3.15 Agusta Gold 3.50 Sheneededtherun 4.25 Havingagoodtime 4.55 Alizee De Janeiro 5.30 Mystic Dreamer Ripon 2.15 Good Night Mr Tom 2.50 Staycation 3.25 Kupa River 4.00 Epaulement 4.35 Ideological 5.10 Sir Ron Priestley  5.45 Canford Bay Chelmsford City 5.25 Frida Kahlo 6.00 Gunmaker 6.30 Glenn Coco 7.00 Lexington Empire 7.30 Precious Plum 8.00 Seeusoon 8.30 Frisella Tips by Greg Wood The bare form of the Craven may not appear unduly impressive with 17 days left until the 2,000 Guineas, but Skardu looked like the winner from the moment Doyle launched him down the outside of his field inside the final quarter-mile and he can only improve significantly for the run and the experience. It is 15 years since Haafhd completed the Craven-Guineas double but Masar, last year’s Craven winner, went on to land the Derby and Skardu too could prove to be one of the trial’s better winners. Whether Too Darn Hot lines up against him remains to be seen but the noises off are not encouraging. His full sisters Lah Ti Dar and So Mi Dar were both forced to miss the Oaks after impressive wins in trial events and Lord Lloyd Webber, his owner, can only wait and hope Too Darn Hot will not suffer a similar misfortune.
