I’m being given the run-around by Debenhams, which won’t refund £180 for an item that is out of stock. I ordered two bridesmaid dresses on 21 March, promising delivery by 27 March. By 26 March, I still had no dispatch email. I asked for a refund but was told I couldn’t have it as they are now in the “dispatch process”. Five days later there was still no sign of them. I was then told the items were out of stock and they didn’t have a date when they would be available. I checked directly with the manufacturer, who told me the line had been discontinued. However, Debenhams is still refusing to refund me, stating its terms and conditions. FH, Hitchin, Hertfordshire It looks as though some halfwit relied on the store’s cancellation policy, which states you can only request a refund within 14 days of receiving the items – which was never going to happen in your case. It’s understandable the ailing chain wants to retain every penny, but worrying that logic only prevailed when you contacted the Observer. Customer services then hastily identified a “process error” and arranged a refund.
