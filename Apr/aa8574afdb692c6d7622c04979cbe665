I decided to investigate a question that has long been on my mind: how dead inside am I? I started with an online quiz, which told me: 50%. Then I started reading about anhedonia, defined as an inability to feel pleasure. But I only got through two articles before I got bored and made a sandwich instead. What provoked such soul-searching? Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s comedy Fleabag. For weeks, my social media channels have been exploding with love for it, an intense outpouring of giddy admiration. When I listen to friends or read reviews, I feel the fever; people struggle for the words to sum up their delight. They’re left breathless. I thought Fleabag was brilliant, but I did not lose my breath. That’s no criticism of the series, rather of myself. There’s no snippet of culture (no record, film, book, celebrity or show) that has pushed me to such euphoria. Not Breaking Bad, Beyoncé’s Lemonade, or Sally Rooney’s first novel, though I deeply appreciated them all. I’m simply not a “fan” person. I like many things, very much, but I cannot obsess. I used to think it was a teenage streak I hadn’t outgrown; that if everyone liked something, I had to kick against it. More recently I comforted myself by saying it was the critic in me, with an eye for insensitivities (with wokeness comes boredom). But I’ve fretted, wondering if there’s something wrong with not being able to feel that immense fan joy. Yet, when the other day I noticed that an older woman I admire had sewn pearly buttons on her coat, I realised I do have fan moments. My obsessions are real-life ones: a new crush or aged balsamic vinegar (I have a collection). It is lovely to love, but how and what? Ultimately, it’s each to their own.
