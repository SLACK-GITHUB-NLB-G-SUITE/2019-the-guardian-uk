Brexit is causing chaos, limbo, crisis, shambles, division and despair according to the front pages of the papers today. “It’s back to square one!” says the Mail, which likens the day’s events to a “farce”. The paper quotes an anonymous highly-placed source who describes the forthcoming five-hour Cabinet meeting as “the mother of all Cabinet meetings”.

The paper says Britain has been “left in limbo” after “another night of high farce at Westminster just 10 days before the UK is due to leave the EU”.

The paper runs through the various options that were rejected, saying parliament was “mired in deadlock” and that though May “will now summon her warring cabinet to Downing Street for a five-hour showdown” it was “unclear how [May] will now proceed”.

The paper lays the blame squared at the “embattled” PM’s feet, saying “Theresa May’s Brexit shambles rumbled on last night”. The Mirror says parliament saw “chaotic scenes… on another night of division and despair” and seems to be setting up Jeremy Corbyn as the voice of reason in this mess, quoting him expressing his disappointment that no solution secured a majority yesterday.
