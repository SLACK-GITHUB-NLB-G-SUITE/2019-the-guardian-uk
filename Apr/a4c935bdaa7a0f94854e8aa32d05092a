Ferrari defended their use of team orders in China, despite the decision failing to make any difference to their finishing positions. Mattia Binotto, the team principal, remained convinced it had been the right thing to do, while Charles Leclerc conceded he had accepted the team’s explanation for telling him to cede his place to Sebastian Vettel. Leclerc had jumped Vettel at the start, taking third place, but Ferrari ordered him to let Vettel past, believing the German was quicker. Having done so, however, Vettel made no inroads into Lewis Hamilton’s lead and the pair finished third and fifth. “We tried and it didn’t work but it was right to give that chance to Seb,” Binotto said. “It was difficult as a team to give the order because we understand the drivers they need to battle to stay ahead. So it was certainly not an easy decision. I have to thank Charles in the way he behaved. He again showed he is a good team player but I think there will be a time when the situation will be inverted.” Leclerc had said he wanted an explanation from Ferrari and although he did not look particularly happy, appeared to have accepted it. “We had the meeting,” he said. “It was not an easy situation, I was struggling with tyres, we both were, at the time it just felt like Seb was quicker but obviously being behind me for some laps he damaged his tyres and when he went in front his tyres were probably also damaged.” Vettel accepted it had been a difficult decision but argued that Leclerc may be the beneficiary in future. “Usually with this kind of stuff it is never pleasant but also what goes around comes around. We have so many races, only time will tell whether we did something right or wrong. At the time you try to do what is right although I can see it is not easy for anyone involved.”
