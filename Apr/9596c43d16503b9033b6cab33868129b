We’ve just seen the biggest, most expensive TV episode to date, and a battle scene more intense than ever before, and we’re still only halfway through the season. Can the next battle top that? Will Dany and Jon overcome their awkward relationship issues? Will one of the Lannister brothers kill Cersei? Will Gendry end up on the Iron Throne? Will there even be a throne to sit on by the end? We want to hear what you think will – or should – happen at the end of Game of Thrones. Meanwhile, here’s what you thought at the start of the series. Tell us who you think will be the last human/dragon standing. Use the form below to tell us what you think will happen.
