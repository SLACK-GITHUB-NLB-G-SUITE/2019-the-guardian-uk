When referring to inaccuracies concerning Alexander Hamilton (Musical morphs into exhibition with one eye on correcting errors and omissions, 27 April), mention is made of his childhood in St Croix, but not that he was born in Charlestown, Nevis, where he spent the first eight or nine years of his life. The island is not mentioned once in the musical. His birthplace, which lies within feet of the old slave market, was reconstructed in 1983 and now houses the Museum of Nevis History. Biographer Ron Chernow, whose book inspired the musical, records: “Hamilton would regularly have passed the slave-auction blocks at Market Shop and Crosses Alley and beheld the barbarous whippings in the public square.” The musical also calls Hamilton’s mother a “whore”, for which there is no evidence at all.Martin HoylesLondon
