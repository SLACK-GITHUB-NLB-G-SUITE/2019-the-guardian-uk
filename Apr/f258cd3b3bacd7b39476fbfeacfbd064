Zines – pamphlet-like, often non-professional publications – have long been associated with grassroots activism as a means of raising awareness and challenging accepted narratives. While some exist simply to celebrate a cultural niche, others are a platform for those who feel their voice isn’t being heard elsewhere, typically offering a low-cost, DIY means of protest. What’s more, with the spirit of protest in the air, they are thriving. “To me, radical zines are ones that change the discourse,” says Mia Maxwell, the founder of media-diversity title Fem Zine, speaking at a panel discussing the rise of the radical zine during Fashion Revolution Week. The history of small-circulation zines, especially those that take a stand against the mainstream, is extensive. The term “fanzine” was coined in October 1940 by the chess champion Russ Chauvenet, who first used it in the sci-fi zine Detours, which he founded. Punk zines emerged in the late 70s, continuing into the 90s when the band Bikini Kill published the riot grrrl manifesto in their zine. Hamja Ahsan, the founder of the zine festival DIY Cultures, also references the zine-making that took place at the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, where women protested in the 80s and 90s against the stationing of cruise missiles on the base. While it’s true that zines started as a means of distributing information outside of the mainstream media well before it was available online, Ahsan argues that they function equally well as a solution to “digital fatigue”. He also believes that many spaces that were once considered radical have now become commercialised; in a time when “so much of politics is about celebrity”, he says, zines offer a more authentic platform. So, with zines continuing to carve out a space for marginalised voices and provide a platform for topics sidelined by politics or the media, here are eight with a focus on climate change and fashion sustainability worth delving into. The fanzine put out by the Fashion Revolution movement seeks to “uncover the stories behind the clothing we wear” and make “a strong and beautiful visual impact to enhance the journey”. Its fourth issue, Fashion Craft Revolution, focuses on “craft as culture”, touching on issues of cultural appropriation and the challenges facing artisans in the 21st century and beyond. An irregularly published zine on its seventh issue, it describes itself as the “last surviving ecology magazine”. Ecocore seeks to understand and protect nature “from the unique point of view of theory, aesthetics and culture”. Think mesmerising eco-themed imagery alongside big-name contributors.
