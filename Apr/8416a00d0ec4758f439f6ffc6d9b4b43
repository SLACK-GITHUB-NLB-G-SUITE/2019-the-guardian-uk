Gawain Jones battled through two marathon final round games in Iceland this week to achieve a career-best world elite rating of over 2700, and the 31-year-old Yorkshireman also laid down a marker as a definitive new England No 1. Jones, the 2012 and 2017 British champion, was a double silver medallist at last month’s world team championship in Kazakhstan, and confirmed his impressive form with an unbeaten 7/9 tie for first in the strong Reykjavik Open. He has been steadily improving since his disaster against Magnus Carlsen at Wijk 2018, when the world champion blundered a bishop in the opening but still won. One of the technical reasons has been a switch in his main defence to 1 d4 from the King’s Indian 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 Bg7 to the Grunfeld with 3…d5. Michael Adams had been the top dog in England for some 20 years but the Cornishman, 47, has been below par for several months, dropping points in the world teams and the Bundesliga. Apart from a brief bad patch in 2010, Adams’s current rating of around 2695 is his lowest since the 1990s. David Howell and Luke McShane, both world team double medallists, remain in contention for No 1 but are less consistent than Jones. England’s other 2600+ grandmasters are Matthew Sadler, who gives precedence to his IT career, and Nigel Short, now 53, who has become a globetrotting ambassador for chess’s international body, Fide. England’s over-65 team of amateurs scored a heroic and historic success on Thursday when they drew 2-2 with top-seeded Russia and its legends from the golden Soviet era. Robert Bellin, Nigel Povah and Tony Stebbings all drew with grandmasters rated 150-200 points above them, and it was England who got close to victory when Ian Snape on board four gave perpetual check in a near-winning position. England over-50s, seeded fourth, lost 1.5-2.5 to the United States, top seeds and defending champions. Games from both over-50 and over-65 are viewable free and live online daily (1pm BST start) until Tuesday. England have never won either event despite several serious attempts, but a major opportunity will occur in 2021. In that year Adams becomes eligible for the over-50s, while John Nunn and Jon Speelman will qualify as over-65s. A golden double is a realistic target if English chess administrators are willing to plan for it. Eight players were on the winning 7/9 score in Reykjavik, where the tie-break rules awarded the trophy to Constantin Lupulescu even though the Romanian lost a marathon queen ending to Jones in the penultimate round. Jones was placed officially fourth, behind Iran’s 15-year-old rising star Alireza Firouzja. Firouzja v Lupulescu was the key game at Reykjavik, especially its controversial opening, where Black treated the sober 1 e4 e6 French as if it was a violent Sicilian 1 e4 c5. The black player was well prepared for the game, since the prodigy had played the line previously as White. Early on, 9 dxc5 is necessary since if 10 0-0-0? c4! and Black’s attack is faster. Black’s 11-14th moves sacrifice a knight for a fast push of Black’s a7 pawn. As the game shows, this plan is very dangerous for White, so a key question, yet to be tested, is whether the attack still works after the improvement 13 Kb1! As played, Black’s assault stormed through White’s defences despite mutual time pressure errors, and the teen got some criticism for not preparing better. His speciality is one-minute bullet (one minute for all your moves) where Firouzja is in the world top three along with Carlsen and the US champion Hikaru Nakamura. 1 e4 e6 2 d5 d5 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e5 Nfd7 5 f4 c5 6 Nf3 Nc6 7 Be3 Be7! 8 Qd2 0-0 9 dxc5 Qa5 10 0-0-0 b6 11 Bb5 Nb4 12 a3 bxc5! 13 Bxd7?
