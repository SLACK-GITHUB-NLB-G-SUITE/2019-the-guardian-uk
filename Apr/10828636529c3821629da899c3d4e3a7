The Fleetwood manager, Joey Barton, says he “emphatically denies all the allegations” made following an incident in the tunnel after his side’s game against Barnsley at Oakwell on Saturday. Police on Wednesday made an arrest over the incident that is said to have left the Barnsley manager, Daniel Stendel, with facial injuries. No confirmation was forthcoming that the man in question was Barton. The visitors’ manager was spoken to before leaving the Oakwell car park after his side’s defeat. Police had contacted the Lancashire club after Barnsley made a complaint to the football authorities over an alleged assault on Stendel. Barton on Thursday made a statement on Twitter. “With regards to the alleged incident on Saturday following our game against Barnsley, I emphatically deny all the allegations made,” he wrote. “Given this matter has not been formally closed, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment.” With regards to the alleged incident on Saturday following our game against Barnsley, I emphatically deny all the allegations made.
