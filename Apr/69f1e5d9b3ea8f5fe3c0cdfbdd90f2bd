We, the undersigned, call for the immediate release of Dr Moncef Kartas, who has been unlawfully detained by the Tunisian authorities since 26 March 2019. As a member of the panel of experts of the United Nations security council committee established pursuant to resolution 1973 (2011) concerning Libya, Dr Kartas enjoys immunity under the UN convention on the privileges and immunities (1946). This includes immunity from arrest or detention. The UN secretary-general has confirmed in multiple notes verbales to the Tunisian authorities that at the time of his detention, Dr Kartas was performing his official mission. The detention of Dr Kartas by the Tunisian authorities is, therefore, a serious violation of Tunisia’s international obligations. Further, his detention is a direct impediment to the work of the committee, having occurred at the same time that the panel of experts is preparing its interim report. Dr Kartas, a dual national of both Germany and Tunisia, is being investigated for the premeditated betrayal of secrets concerning Tunisian national security to foreign states or their associates. A conviction for such crimes could lead to the death penalty. Only the UN secretary general has the right to waive the immunity for experts such as Dr Kartas. Tunisia, a signatory to the convention since 1957, has not presented any request for or evidence justifying a waiver of his immunity. No evidence has been presented for the alleged cooperation of Dr Kartas with foreign states or their associates in the betrayal of secrets pertaining to Tunisian national security. The detention of Dr Kartas on spurious grounds, and in violation of his immunity, raises serious questions over the state of the rule of law in Tunisia. Dr Kartas enjoys the highest reputation within the research community and among international and non-governmental organisations. We, the undersigned, personally know and value Dr Kartas as a committed researcher and practitioner with impeccable ethical and professional standards. Dr Kartas has consistently demonstrated his commitment to promoting the rule of law and security, particularly in North Africa and in Tunisia. Since 2016, Dr Kartas has investigated breaches of the UN-imposed embargo on arms to Libya for the UN panel of experts. Through this work, Dr Kartas seeks to contribute to peace and security in Libya, which in turn directly serves the interests of Tunisia’s national security. Dr Kartas has worked and published widely on issues of conflict transformation and armed violence reduction for many years. He led a multi-year project focused on understanding and mitigating armed violence in north Africa for Small Arms Survey, a Swiss non-governmental organisation, during which he regularly briefed senior officials in the Tunisian defence, interior and foreign ministries. He has also regularly provided training and advice to Tunisian and Libyan security officials on strategy and policy development. We express full solidarity with Dr Kartas and his family. We reiterate that Dr Kartas is being illegally detained and call upon the United Nations secretary general, the member states of the security council Libya sanctions committee, and, in particular, the German government, to condemn the actions of the Tunisian government and to undertake all efforts to secure his immediate release. We call upon the government of Tunisia to respect the immunity afforded to Dr Kartas under international law and to release him immediately.
