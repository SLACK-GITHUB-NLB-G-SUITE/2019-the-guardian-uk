Garcia grew up in Hawaii and turned professional in his teens. After a promising early career it looked like he may have missed his chance at reaching the top of his sport but a resurgence in form helped him to the world title in 2000. He has also won the triple crown of surfing – three events in Hawaii at the end of the year that often involve huge waves – six times, more than any other surfer. He was also the second surfer to win more than $1m in prize money. Sunny...I love you, brother. I just can’t even fathom you not here. We’ve got so much more living to do before we are done. There’s been hard times but there have been so many good ones, too. Just praying you wake up and we get more of you. 🙏🏽 #MyOtherBrother A post shared by  Kelly Slater (@kellyslater) on Apr 30, 2019 at 1:36am PDT Eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater was among those to post messages of support. “Sunny...I love you, brother,” wrote Slater on Instagram. “I just can’t even fathom you not here. We’ve got so much more living to do before we are done. There’s been hard times but there have been so many good ones, too. Just praying you wake up and we get more of you.” Garcia was inducted into surfing’s walk of fame in 2010, and has been active in charities for autism and cystic fibrosis. However, he was sentenced to three months in prison for tax fraud in 2007, and has spoken about his struggles with depression.
