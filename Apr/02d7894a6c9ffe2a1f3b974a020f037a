Aaron Ramsey has told Unai Emery he is hoping to play for Arsenal again before the end of the season. The Wales midfielder limped off at Napoli during his team’s 1-0 Europa League win with a hamstring injury, but when player and manager chatted on Friday lunchtime Ramsey confident he could recover quickly. “We spoke about that – ‘Maybe in two or three weeks I can play some matches’ – and we are going to wait for that,” Emery said. The Arsenal manager also admitted the situation with Ramsey earlier this season had been confused while the player’s future was wrapped up in the ticking down of his contract, before the club withdrew their offer and the player made his arrangements to join Juventus. “He is a very important player but his confusion maybe did not give us the performances he is doing now,” Emery said. “In the last few matches his performances have been amazing and helping us a lot in the key moments this season. His injury is bad news.” If Ramsey does return in two weeks he would be on the verge of fitness for Arsenal’s Europa League semi-final against Valencia, which is scheduled for 2 and 9 May. If it is three weeks he would at least be able to clock up a farewell appearance on the last day of the Premier League season at Burnley. The prognosis is more encouraging than first feared in Naples. Ramsey will be a spectator for Arsenal’s game at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday, when Emery is expected to rotate his team quite heavily.
