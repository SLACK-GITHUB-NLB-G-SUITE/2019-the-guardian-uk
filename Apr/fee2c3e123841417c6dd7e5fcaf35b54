If you’re south Asian and have even a passing interest in food, you’ll know that now is a special time of year: mango season. I’m not talking about the robust, firm-fleshed ones that are usually grown in the Americas and available year-round in supermarkets, but the far rarer varieties grown in India, prized for their delicate, perfumed, sunset-coloured flesh. The alphonso is the so-called ‘king’ of mangos but, in our house, it was always the kesar that was prized above all else. As a child, my parents would slice them up with a sharp knife to be wolfed down by greedy mouths. This year, I’ll be using them to flavour a simple but luxurious dessert of baked yoghurt. Enjoyed with a little extra fresh mango on the side, of course. Kesar and alphonso mangos are usually sold only in Asian food shops. If you’re struggling to find them fresh, you can get excellent- quality tinned pulp in the world food aisles of big supermarkets. This was what kept the south Asian community going in 2014, when imports of our precious mangos were temporarily banned. Prep 5 minCook 15 minMakes 4 120g kesar mango pulp (fresh or from a tin)200g full-fat Greek yoghurt160g double cream160g sweetened evaporated milk Heat the oven to 160C (150C fan)/335F/gas 3½. If you’re using fresh mango, scoop the flesh out into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to mash it to a smooth pulp (you can use a food processor to do this, too). Stir in the yoghurt, cream and milk, then decant into four ramekins. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and leave to cool to room temperature. Serve with extra pieces of fresh mango or a drizzle of the tinned pulp on top.
