Leicester are exploring the possibility of signing the Atalanta striker Andrea Petagna, who is currently on loan at Spal, in the summer. Scouts have watched the 23-year-old, who has one full cap for Italy and scored 14 goals this season despite Spal being in the bottom half of the table, several times and Leicester are considering a bid of €20m. The situation is complicated by Spal having an obligation to buy Petagna for €10m if they avoid relegation, which is likely. They are 13th, nine points ahead of Empoli in the relegation zone, with five games to go. Pategna is a strong and hard-working striker with excellent technique. He was part of the Atalanta team who finished ahead of Everton in their 2017‑18 Europa League group and advanced to the round of 32, where they lost to Borussia Dortmund. Cardiff were interested in signing Pategna in January but could not agree a deal.
