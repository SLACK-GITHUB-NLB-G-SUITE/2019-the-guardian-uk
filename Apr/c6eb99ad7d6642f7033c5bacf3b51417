The early date for Easter last year did nothing at all for attendances at the three British meetings on Good Friday, with Lingfield, Newcastle and Bath suffering declines of 30%, 39% and 44% on their 2017 crowd figures as potential racegoers checked the weather forecast and decided to stay indoors. The numbers should bounce back in style this year, however, with temperatures expected to be well above the mid-April average at all three tracks, so Bath – which is racing for the first time this season – and Lingfield can expect to welcome their biggest crowds of the year and there should be more than enough to keep everyone entertained. Wissahickon, the winner of eight of his 10 starts, is the star name on the card at Lingfield, where he will set off at around 1-3 for the Easter Classic. Wissahickon looked like something special when he bolted up off a mark of 107 in last year’s Cambridgeshire but he has taken his form to a new level on the all-weather over the winter and both his pedigree - by Tapit out of a Grade Two winner on dirt - and his latest Timeform rating suggest that he would not be out of his depth in a Breeders’ Cup Classic. He has the worst of the draw in stall eight today but it will be a bitter disappointment if Wissahickon (4.15) cannot extend his current winning streak to six. John Gosden’s colt is not the only short-priced favourite on today’s Lingfield card as Amade (2.00), in the Marathon, and Kachy (3.05), in the Sprint, both have obvious claims. Those looking for a return at a bigger price could be tempted by Straight Right (4.45), who recorded a useful time when finishing a staying-on second last time out, and Charming Kid (3.40) in the three-year-olds’ race. Bayroot (3.20) and Chosen World (2.45) make most appeal at Newcastle while Petrus (3.30) and Acclaim The Nation (5.05) should both go well at Bath.
