A man who posted on Facebook that he “hated Muslims” has been charged with possession and manufacture of explosives after police found a substance he allegedly referred to as “mother of Satan” at his Adelaide home. Aaron Ellis, 43, was remanded in custody after appearing in the Elizabeth magistrates court on Tuesday. Sgt Daren Cross told the court Ellis had come to the attention of police in February after he posted on Facebook that “he hated Muslims”. Police visited his house in Davoren Park, but could not find anything “constituting an offence”, Cross told the court, the ABC reported. But police returned on Monday night after receiving new information that Ellis was in possession of chemicals. “Police attended with [the] bomb squad … [and] he explained that he mixed the chemicals into a substance referred to as ‘Mother of Satan’,” Cross said. “This is a highly volatile explosive and cannot be transported,” the ABC reported Cross as saying. “Bomb squad members have advised that it will need to be detonated in situ.” Police began conducting what was expected to be a series of controlled blasts at the Davoren Park address on Tuesday afternoon. Ahead of the controlled detonations it was removed from the shed and placed in an area in the backyard of the property. The area around the home was sealed off and neighbouring properties evacuated. Locals were warned to stay inside and away from any windows. Ellis was remanded in custody and will return to court next week when a report on possible home detention bail will be considered.
