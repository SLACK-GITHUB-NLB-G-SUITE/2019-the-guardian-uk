I feel like I’ve achieved something, having found a leading contender for the 2,000 Guineas who is actually being aimed at the race. It is not, of course, Too Darn Hot, who has managed to do himself a mischief on the gallops. Nor yet is it Persian King, who is reportedly to be kept in France for the time being. But I can pass on that Mohaather, the speedy winner of the Greenham Stakes, has now been committed to the first Classic of the season, a week on Saturday. Connections wanted to see how last week’s racing in Newmarket played out before making a decision and are now keen to have a go. “Sheikh Hamdan intimated to me at the end of last week that he would like to run, if everybody is happy with the horse,” said Angus Gold, racing manager to the owner. “So, with any luck, that’s where we’re going. “There’s a lot of nice horses in there, still. But he’s done nothing wrong, this horse, and he certainly deserves his chance. He’s done most of his winning on softer ground but I don’t see any reason, physically, why he shouldn’t go on faster ground. “He showed a lot of speed the other day. Until we see him in a mile race, we can’t know if a mile is for him. But we’ve got a horse who’s won a trial, so we might as well give it a go.” I was quite taken with Mohaather’s performance at Newbury but I was left with the impression of a fast horse who would be a strong contender for the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot. But I see he has a half-brother who won over two miles for Pat Eddery, so who knows what can happen, eh? Mohaather is a 9-1 shot for the Guineas. Just above him at 10s is the John Gosden-trained Calyx, who has shortened across the board, having been 14-1 yesterday and is now 6-1 in places. The trainer said last week that Calyx would be running at Ascot next week rather than the Guineas but that was before he confirmed the bad news about Too Darn Hot and perhaps the position has changed. Archie Watson sends another super-quick (we hope) juvenile to the races on Tuesday. Endless Joy (2.00) is a 4-5 shot at Yarmouth, despite a Godolphin rival, because the trainer is doing so well with his youngsters and also because he singled this filly out for special mention at a media morning at his stable a fortnight ago, when he named this card as her target. Half an hour later, Love So Deep (2.35) is also popular, at 3-1 from the opening 11-2. There are plenty of reasons why this three-year-old has improved since last year, including natural development, a change of stables and a step up to the distance suggested by her pedigree, but whatever the case she clearly has improved. She reappeared at Nottingham a fortnight ago to get up close home over a more fancied pair and the 5lb rise is not intimidating. Silvestre de Sousa, who was aboard the Nottingham runner-up, takes the ride this time. Then there’s Monoxide (3.05) at 3-1 in the following race for older horses. A lightly raced son of Galileo, gelded soon after breaking his duck at Chelmsford in November, he has plenty more to give and makes more appeal than the favourite, Hamlul, a Frankel colt who did not go on from a Beverley success last summer.
