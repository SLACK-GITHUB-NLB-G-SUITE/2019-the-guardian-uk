The New York Giants sixth-round draft selection Corey Ballentine has been injured and his college teammate Dwane Simmons killed in a shooting in Topeka, Kansas, on Sunday morning. Simmons was 23 at the time of his death and had played alongside Ballentine at Washburn University. Ballentine’s injuries are not life threatening, and he should make a full recovery. “Any time we lose a student it is a sad occasion, but it is particularly poignant to lose a student through such a senseless act,” the Washburn president, Jerry Farley, wrote in a statement. “Both Dwane and Corey have been great examples and representatives of the football team and of Washburn University in general. This was a terrible way to end a day which should have been a day of celebration and a day to look forward to Dwane’s upcoming year at Washburn and the beginning of Corey’s professional career.” Washburn’s coach, Craig Schurig, paid tribute to Simmons, who had played for the team for three years. “Heartbreaking news about Dwane Simmons,” Schurig said in a statement. “Dwane is one of the most energetic and well-liked players I have ever coached at Washburn. Dwane’s infectious smile and love for football and his teammates was truly inspirational. Our prayers of healing go out to his family, his parents Navarro and Yasmine Simmons and Chaquilla Williams.” Ballentine plays at cornerback and was selected in the sixth round by the Giants on Saturday, shortly before the shooting. “Our thoughts are with Dwane Simmons’ family, friends and teammates and the rest of the Washburn community,” the Giants said in a statement.
