Yeovil and Rotherham were the big losers on a heart-stopping day of Football League action, both dropping out of their respective divisions. Paul Warne’s Rotherham are relegated from the Championship after they let the lead slip at West Brom. Having opened the scoring early in the second half through Clark Robertson’s header, they conceded two goals in three minutes – a Jay Rodriguez penalty and a first senior goal for Rekeem Harper – in a 2-1 defeat. This meant fourth-bottom Millwall’s point in a goalless draw at Stoke in the division’s early game was enough to consign the Millers to an immediate return to League One. Sheffield Wednesday’s hopes of remaining in the play-off picture finally evaporated after a 3-3 draw at Preston. Derby had started the day in the final play-off slot, consolidated thanks to goals from Tom Lawrence and Jayden Bogle in a 2-0 victory at Bristol City. City’s mathematical shot at extending their season now requires them to win their remaining two games, and for results to go against both Derby and Middlesbrough, who beat Reading 2-1. Reading’s mathematical safety was confirmed by results elsewhere. Swansea were another side starting the day with mathematically possible, though hideously unlikely dreams of making the play-offs, and while results elsewhere went against them, they failed to get the necessary win at home to Hull anyway despite Oli McBurnie’s first-half double, with Jarrod Bowen and Nouha Dicko pegging them back late on as they were held to a 2-2 draw. Nottingham Forest’s Costel Pantilimon saved Nahki Wells’s late penalty to ensure his side won 1-0 away at QPR through Karim Ansarifard’s 55th-minute goal, while Birmingham were held 1-1 by Wigan despite Lukas Jutkiewicz’s second-minute goal – Nick Powell equalised in first-half stoppage time for the visitors.

Second-placed Barnsley did the reverse, recovering from an early deficit at home to Blackpool before Cauley Woodrow and defender Liam Lindsay gave them a crucial win that leaves promotion in their hands as they join Luton on 91 points. Portsmouth and Sunderland drew 1-1 to remain third and fourth respectively on 87 and 85 points respectively with two games apiece still to play, while Charlton won and Doncaster drew to consolidate the final two play-off places and move clearer of Peterborough, now four points behind – though with a game in hand – after a 3-0 defeat at Walsall.

At one point the bottom three of Macclesfield, Yeovil and Notts County all sat on 41 points as they sought to avoid the two relegation spots. But as the afternoon progressed, Notts County – who started the day bottom after just two wins from 12 games – took charge against Grimsby and won 2-1, while Macclesfield prevailed 1-0 at Port Vale. Yeovil’s 2-0 lead at Northampton – which had looked like taking them clear of the bottom-two – evaporated in six second-half minutes, leaving them on 39 points and unable to catch third-bottom Macclesfield, who now have 43. Bury, who began the day in second, saw their match at Tranmere called off due to a waterlogged Prenton Park pitch – the two promotion hopefuls now meet at 7.45pm BST on Tuesday. Mansfield missed their chance to move up from third after Stevenage’s Ilias Chair scored in injury-time to complete a 2-1 victory. Leyton Orient will return to the Football League next season after their draw at Braintree secured promotion and the National League title after a two-year stay in the division.
