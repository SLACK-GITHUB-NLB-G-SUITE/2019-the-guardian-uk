Paul Pogba said Manchester United can win at Barcelona and progress to the Champions League semi-finals if they can be “killers in front of goal”. United did not have a shot on target during Wednesday’s 1-0 home defeat in the first leg but Pogba is confident the tie is far from settled. “We saw a team we can beat,” he said. “If you don’t believe that then you just let them go through. We believe we can beat them. They are Barcelona but we are Manchester United and we play in the Champions League like they do and we can go through.” The midfielder feels Barça could be affected by United’s recovery from 2-0 down in the previous round to knock out Paris Saint-Germain. “Probably PSG will be in their minds, because they saw what we can do,” he said. “They will be comfortable on their own pitch but let’s see.” Pogba acknowledged United will need to be at their best next Tuesday. “We have to avoid giving them chances and be killers in front of goal,” he said. “We are 1-0 down and now go to Camp Nou but we believe chances will come over there. We know we can hurt them as well as they can hurt us.” He refused to respond to a question from Spanish media as to whether he would like to face Barcelona in a clásico, having said in March that playing for Real Madrid would be “a dream for anyone”. Pogba, who has described himself as happy at United, was then asked whether he was staying at the club. “I only talk about the match, not about other things,” he said.
