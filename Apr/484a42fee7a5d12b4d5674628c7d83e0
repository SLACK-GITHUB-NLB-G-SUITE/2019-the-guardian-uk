With 97% of votes counted, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party appear to be tied. Most likely Netanyahu. With a grouping of nationalist, religious and far-right parties that gathered up parliamentary seats, the incumbent leader has the clearest path to forming a coalition government out of the 120-seat Knesset. More numbers will arrive later on Wednesday but an official tally may not come in until Friday. Israel’s political system is based on delicately formed and unstable coalitions crafted by a majority in the Knesset. No party has won a majority since Israel’s first election, in 1949. After the votes are counted, the president, Reuven Rivlin, will start consultations to see which party has the highest chance of forming a coalition. This is not necessarily the party with the most votes, but the one most likely to be able to win the support of other parties to form a government. Once the president tasks a candidate with creating a coalition government, they have 42 days to do so. And in 2015, it took Netanyahu more than a month to play the political game and gather enough seats. If a candidate fails to form a government, the president asks another politician to try. This year, Netanyahu already has unofficial support from some parties. If Netanyahu is able to secure a victory, this summer he will become Israel’s longest-serving leader ever. But he also faces three separate corruption cases in which the attorney general has announced his intention to indict, a process that could start in the next few weeks.
