The year was 1999 and I was at the USA Basketball men’s national team trials in Colorado Springs. After three grueling days of tryouts, I found myself sitting in a dorm room with Luke Recker and the late Jason Collier, who were also vying for spots to represent the United States at that summer’s World University Games in Spain. It wasn’t a light conversation or a casual shooting of the breeze. What I heard will stick with me the rest of my life. Luke and Jason had each played two seasons at Indiana University under the legendary but volatile coach Bobby Knight before transferring out to different schools. They spent that evening telling stories about Knight for two hours straight. I was completely shocked by what I heard. The level of torment they both endured: the public and private humiliations, the degrading outbursts, the verbal abuse, the physical abuse, the cursing, the yelling, the screaming, the insults, the attempt to completely break them down and – most of all – the outpour of support their former coach received from all of the adults who worshipped at his throne. Basketball is a religion in Indiana and Knight, who coached the Hoosiers to three national championships, was the pope. I remember asking them: Why didn’t you tell somebody? They looked at me and shook their heads as if I just couldn’t understand. There was nobody to tell, they said. Everyone in the entire state was on his side. I remember the visible agony in their eyes as they recounted the various indignities that had happened to them. I remember looking at Luke’s hands as they couldn’t stop shaking while he revisited the recurring nightmare that had haunted his dreams like Freddy Krueger. He spoke about literally closing his eyes while trying to go to sleep and hearing the sound of Bobby Knight’s enraged yelling and cursing and abuse, which kept him up night after night. They discussed the years of therapy they both required, the threats they received after transferring, the hate and the criticism from total strangers. What the devil were people criticizing you for, I asked. They said that people called them weak, soft, cowards, sissies and plenty more expletives that aren’t worth repeating. Fast-forward one year to 2000, my senior year at Syracuse. A former Indiana player named Neil Reed went public with his claims that Knight had choked him during a practice three years earlier. With Luke and Jason’s stories fresh in my mind, I immediately believed him. I wasn’t surprised that Knight denied it, but I was shocked to see then-Indiana player AJ Guyton not only deny Reed’s allegations but attack a teammate’s character. I can still remember watching Guyton backing his coach on TV: “Without this system, without coach Knight challenging me, that would not have been possible. I say that because at Indiana you know you’re going to be challenged. I don’t think Neil Reed understood that. In order to become an All-American, you’re going to be challenged by a coach that pushes you to the limit. It’s all a process of a boy becoming a man.” It was as if he was under a trance like Children of the Corn or something. It felt like he’d been programmed: Bobby Knight is great, Bobby Knight would never hurt us, Bobby Knight loves us like his own sons. Then a video surfaced. It turned out – despite the coach’s vehement denial of all allegations, his broadsides on the media for attacking him through anonymous sources, his public disparagement and attempted character assassination of his accuser – the leaked footage confirmed Bobby Knight had indeed done exactly what Neil Reed said he did. (Incredibly, not even that confirmed physical assault was enough to warrant Knight’s dismissal, though a run-in with a student on campus several months later finally was.) These memories all came flooding back during this year’s NCAA tournament when I saw Michigan State coach Tom Izzo have to be restrained by his players while berating freshman forward Aaron Henry during the Spartans’ first-round win over Bradley. The Hall of Fame coach, apparently set off by some mistake or blown assignment on Henry’s part, came unhinged as his players approached to the bench during a stoppage in play, pointing a finger squarely in Henry’s chest as a teammate stepped in to separate them. Then in the huddle, Izzo shot up from his chair and lunged in Henry’s direction only to be intercepted by another teammate. Izzo is heated 👀#MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/2GLxSAFxR0 Apparently, this is nothing new for Izzo, who like Knight is widely beloved for elevating a midwestern city to national prominence by winning: eight Final Four appearances (including this year) and an NCAA title in 2000. What was telling is how the massive stage of March Madness and a national TV audience of millions wasn’t enough to deter Izzo from his outburst. (Almost like how body-worn and dashboard cameras aren’t enough to deter some bad police officers from the brutality or even the executions of unarmed citizens. But I digress.) What stood out was less Izzo’s violent outburst and more his players’ familiar, resigned reaction to it, like it was nothing they hadn’t seen before. It made me remember Neil Reed’s words: “He came at me ... and grabbed me with one hand. I grabbed his wrist and started walking back, and by this time people ... grabbed coach Knight and pulled him away.” What stood out was less Izzo’s violent outburst and more his players’ familiar, resigned reaction to it, like it was nothing they hadn’t seen before Why should a coach have to be restrained from attacking one of his players? Surprisingly, many people don’t have an issue with Izzo’s conduct, as indicated by how quickly it passed through the headlines. Many have rationalized coach-player interaction and athlete-management behavior in their hero worship, arriving at a mindset that coaches have to do whatever they need to do to “maintain order”. And furthermore many people – including, sadly, a lot of parents of athletes – have told themselves that this type of verbal abuse and belittling will somehow benefit the players in the long run by preparing them for life and creating more humble and worthy athletes. These are the same statements many gave as a response to every Bobby Knight accusation and criticism: The kids nowadays are soft and weak. They don’t need to be coddled. They need discipline. They need structure. They need to be held accountable for their mistakes. News flash: You can achieve all of those things without verbally or physically abusing a player. Without publicly humiliating or berating them. Without challenging a player’s manhood or attempting to demean them to the point where they are forced to defend themselves. When a reporter questioned Izzo about the incident after the Bradley game, the coach was predictably unapologetic: “I don’t know what kind of business you’re in, but I tell you what: if I was a head of a newspaper, and you didn’t do your job, you’d be held accountable. That’s the way it is.” Tom Izzo was asked about getting after Aaron Henry."I don't know what kind of business you're in, but I tell ya what, if I was a head of a newspaper, and you didn't do your job, you'd be held accountable." pic.twitter.com/kqcWykUY6X Again: You can hold someone accountable without resorting to abusive behavior. Besides, in what setting except athletics would it be acceptable to have to be physically restrained by other employees from attacking a person because they didn’t “do their job” . The reality is, if Aaron Henry wanted to, he could have put 64-year-old Tom Izzo to sleep with one shot. But if he had done that, all of mainstream America would have come together in demonizing him and he probably would never play basketball again. No one is more aware of the power imbalance between Tom Izzo and an unpaid 19-year-old freshman than Izzo himself, which is exactly why he feels emboldened to carry on like he did. I have seen and played for a few coaches who exhibited that same type of cowardice in my career. For a coach to physically challenge a player knowing that he has all the power and authority in the situation, and that the player is without the ability to actually take up their challenge, doesn’t constitute good coaching no matter how you spin it. It is the act of a bully and a coward. Just as we have police officers (not all, but too many) who exhibit these characteristics, we also have coaches (not all, but too many) who do the exact same thing. And just as we have a blue wall of silence where “good cops” refuse to call out “bad cops”, we have “good coaches” who refuse to call out “bad coaches”. Don’t get me wrong. I am all for discipline. All for structure. I am a firm believer of guidelines and consequences for the failure to deliver on what is expected of you. But it has to be done the right way. You can correct a player and treat them like a human being at the same time. I coach my son’s AAU team, the FBCG Dynamic Disciples, and every player and parent will tell you that Coach Thomas doesn’t take any foolishness from the players. I am strict. I hold them all accountable. Do I yell at times? Of course I do. What coach never raises his or her voice? I have very high expectations and am definitely a disciplinarian. But discipline and a display of verbal and potential physical abuse are two very different things. Bottom line: The behavior Tom Izzo displayed during that timeout was alarming and should have raised much more than the few eyebrows it did before everyone quickly moved on. There’s nothing praiseworthy or “old-school” about the teeth-clenched, balled-fist frothing anger he showed: it’s the same old bully tactics Bobby Knight got away with for too long. This conduct shouldn’t be validated by CBS or ESPN or anybody else. Simply put, it’s not OK and should not be acceptable behavior for any coach, or pardoned simply because your players got you to the Final Four.
