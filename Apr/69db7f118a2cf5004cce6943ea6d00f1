Kash Ali’s boxing licence has been suspended pending a hearing, the British Boxing Board of Control has announced. Ali was disqualified for biting David Price during Saturday’s heavyweight bout. The incident happened in round five when Price, 35, landed a fierce blow on the previously undefeated Ali. He reacted by forcing his opponent to the canvas where he was seen to bite the Liverpudlian, leaving a visible mark on his torso. The referee, Mark Lyson, who had earlier docked Ali a point for hitting the back of Price’s head, immediately disqualified him and awarded the victory to Price, who had been ahead on the scorecards. Ali left the M&S Bank Arena under a barrage of drinks thrown by spectators and admitted shortly after the fight that he had been “stupid”. Price claimed he had been bitten more than once and said Ali had asked for a rematch. “I don’t want to share the ring again with an animal like that,” he said. “He did a couple early on and I thought he had lost his head completely. I hurt him to the body just before the final bite he took.” Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels In one of the few precedents in Britain, middleweight Adrian Dodson was banned for 18 months in 1999 after being found guilty of biting opponent Alain Bonnamie.
