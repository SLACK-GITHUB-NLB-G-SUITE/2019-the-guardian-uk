Paul Nicholls can mark the end of another championship-winning season with his fifth success in the Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown, but perhaps not with either of his obvious options. This looks like quarter of a mile further than Present Man really wants to go while Give Me A Copper could do with more rain than seems likely. Adrien Du Pont (3.35) is a very lively outsider for Nicholls at 20-1, having suggested several times that he would relish this sort of marathon. He finished strongly into third in a valuable contest at Kempton and was brought to a standstill by a faller last time. This could be his big day. 1.50 Sandown This looks really competitive and Getaway Trump will surely figure in the closing stages, following his bounce-back success at Ayr. Evidently a troubled journey to Kelso accounts for a poor effort by both him and Black Corton there in February. But Harambe was really impressive in achieving his second hurdles success at Market Rasen and his rating for this handicap debut looks on the lenient side. 2.05 Haydock There will be rain at Haydock but the timing and the effect of it is hard to predict. Wahash is ground versatile up to a point and his close third last time makes the grey of interest here. 2.25 Sandown There are question marks over almost every runner in this Oaksey Chase, so Black Corton must have a big chance of giving Bryony Frost victory on her first ride back from injury. Cobra De Mai is quick enough to spoil the party, however, and achieved a career best at Cheltenham last week. He will bounce off this ground and Dan Skelton’s yard could hardly be hotter. 2.45 Leicester The Commonwealth Cup proved to be the sole success achieved last year by Eqtidaar but he had ready excuses for his defeats in the July Cup and on heavy going at Haydock. This step up in distance ought to help him and this is a good place to start. 3.00 Sandown This Celebration Chase does not seem the ideal vehicle for heroic punting and backing Altior at odds-on is especially unattractive in the circumstances. Fast ground and a sharp track is not a great combination for a horse who seems ready for a step up in distance and his stable appears to be going out of form as the season ends. Sceau Royal could be the one to end the favourite’s winning run. A Grade One winner at this track, he led Altior over the last at Cheltenham before tiring.
