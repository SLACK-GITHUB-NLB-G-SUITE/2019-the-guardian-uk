Google experienced a global outage affecting users as they try to log in to the company’s many applications, including Gmail and Google Docs and any site that allows access via a Google account. The problem lasted nearly two hours, beginning around 11pm BST. The company said it was investigating “an issue with OAuth login” and “an issue with Admin console” on Wednesday evening. The problem was resolved just before 1am BST. Users reported problems in the US, UK, India, Singapore, South Africa, Europe and in Australia. Many were greeted with an error page when they tried to login, citing error 502 and asking them to try again in 30 seconds. Google said they would conduct an internal investigation of the issue and make “appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimise recurrence”. Anyone else literally not able to sign into their gmail account? Google was hit by an outage in March, with with users reporting issues with Gmail, Google Drive, Hangouts and Google Maps for several hours.
