Paul Nicholls will win the National Hunt trainers’ championship for the 11th time this month and he set the seal on an outstanding season at Cheltenham on Thursday when he became only the third trainer in history to saddle 3,000 winners over jumps in Britain. Martin Pipe, who ended his 31-year career with 3,930 jumps winners, and Nicky Henderson, who recently reached 3,100, are the only trainers with more National Hunt winners. So far this year Nicholls has already passed 3,000 career winners in total – including 25 in Ireland, four in France and 11 on the Flat – and 3,000 winners under all codes in Britain. He reached the latest milestone when Kupatana, the 2-1 favourite, took the EBF Mares’ Novice Handicap Chase Final at Cheltenham by a length and a quarter, 28 years after his first success in 1991. “People have talked about the 3,000 winners we’ve already had,” Nicholls said, “but this is the one we really wanted. It’s brilliant to do it and it’s extra-special to do it at Cheltenham. It’s a great achievement for the whole team [and] a fantastic ride by Harry Cobden as she’s a tricky mare.” Nicholls has been beaten to the trainers’ title by Henderson for the past two seasons but is around £400,000 in front of his great rival and almost certain to reclaim the crown when the season concludes at Sandown a week on Saturday. “I’m really looking forward to that,” Nicholls said. “I honestly didn’t think we had a chance at the start of the season and to get the title back is fantastic. We won’t be slowing up. We’ll try to get to 4,000 winners now.” Roger Varian saddled the first two home in the Nell Gwyn Stakes on Tuesday and he extended his run of form to the final day of the Craven meeting as Zabeel Prince quickened impressively to take the Group Three Earl of Sefton Stakes by nearly three lengths. Zabeel Prince is a six-year-old but was making only the ninth start of his career, having missed much of last season after suffering an injury in the Lockinge Stakes in May. “We always thought he would get this sort of trip [nine furlongs] last year but he got injured in the Lockinge and we couldn’t run him until the Joel Stakes in the autumn,” Varian said. “The way he has won there, he might get 10 furlongs.” Zabeel Prince was the second leg of a double for Andre Atzeni, his jockey, but his initial success on Alan King’s Beringer came at a significant cost when he was banned for six days for incorrect use of his whip in the closing stages. If Atzeni does not appeal, the ban will rule him out of the Guineas meeting at Newmarket on 4 and 5 May.
