A police horse died after falling on to a metal pole in a “tragic accident” while responding to reports of disorder at a bank holiday football match. The horse, called Morecambe, was on patrol at a League One game between Blackpool and Fleetwood Town on Monday. Lancashire police said the horse suffered a serious stomach injury when he fell on to the pole outside Blackpool’s Bloomfield Road stadium. Morecambe received urgent medical attention from a vet but was pronounced dead at around 5.20pm. The rider is believed to have fallen on to the side of a horsebox and was taken to Royal Preston hospital by air ambulance. Morecambe was reported to have been ushering fans away from the ground when he became “spooked” and fell on to the pole. Lancashire’s tactical operations division tweeted about the “tragic loss” and said the horse was “fatally injured in a tragic accident whilst responding to reports of disorder”.

Ch Insp Sue Bushell, of the force’s mounted branch, said: “We are all completely devastated by the loss of Morecambe in such tragic circumstances. “The horses are a big part of our police family and Morecambe will be sorely missed by his riders and many colleagues from across the force.” Terry Woods, the assistant chief constable, added that it was “extremely sad news for all of us” and said the welfare of its horses and officers was paramount for the force.
