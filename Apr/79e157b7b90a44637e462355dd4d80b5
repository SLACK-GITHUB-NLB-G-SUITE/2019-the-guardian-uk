The first stage on a circular path leading back to Epsom for the Derby on 1 June saw Cape Of Good Hope take the Blue Riband Trial, the year’s opening trial for the Classic, by half a length on Wednesday. He remains as big as 40-1, however, to give Aidan O’Brien a record-equalling seventh win in the race and stronger candidates from the stable will surely emerge as the cycle of Derby trials winds through Chester, Lingfield, Leopardstown and York. Cape Of Good Hope was one of only two runners in a seven-strong field already holding an entry for the Derby. The remaining five were racing for a free pass into the Classic, avoiding the £85,000 supplementary fee that is now the only other way to get into the field. One of those, last year’s Chesham Stakes winner Arthur Kitt, was backed down to replace Cape Of Good Hope as favourite, perhaps as punters sensed the urgency of his mission. But it was a doomed mission just a couple of strides after the start, as Arthur Kitt stumbled badly and never looked like making up the lost ground. Cape Of Good Hope made good progress in the final quarter-mile to lead inside the final furlong but was closely pressed by Cap Francais, who came from a long way off the pace, before crossing the line half a length in front. “He brought some of the best form into the race,” Kevin Buckley, Coolmore Stud’s British representative, said. “It’s good to get that experience into him [and] he’s a full-brother to Idaho, who was third in the Derby and also to Highland Reel, who won the Coronation Cup, so the family has experienced success around here. I can’t say he’ll definitely come back here [for the Derby] but on that performance, you’d like to think so.” Beverley 1.40 Iva Go 2.15 Knightcap 2.50 Prestbury Park 3.20 King Of Tonga (nb) 3.55 Dragon Sun (nap) 4.25 Agar’s Plough 4.55 Kylie Rules 5.25 Oasis Prince Perth 1.50 Rakhine State 2.25 Theflyingportrait  3.00 Las Tunas 3.30 Saint Leo 4.05 Bordeaux Bill 4.35 Double Whammy 5.10 Rizzardo Warwick 2.00 My Charity 2.35 Danseur Du Large  3.10 Cardigan Bay 3.40 Cruiseaweigh 4.15 Potters Hedger 4.45 Boughtbeforelunch 5.20 The Swagman 5.55 O Connell Street Kempton Park 4.40 So Lonely 5.15 Fransham 5.50 Statistical 6.20 Black Kalanisi 6.50 For Good Measure 7.20 Kings Ryde 7.50 Monsieur Gibraltar Chelmsford City 5.30 The Pinto Kid 6.00 Hero Hero  6.30 Walk On Water 7.00 Dream Of Dreams 7.30 Pentland Lad 8.00 Labrega 8.30 Harbour Vision 9.00 Admiral Rooke Cap Francais was bred by the late John Pearce, who died in January 2017 at the age of 98 and was within a short head of his lifelong dream of both owning and breeding a Derby winner when the 66-1 chance Dragon Dancer was edged out by Sir Percy in one of the closest ever finishes to the Classic in 2006. “It’s £85,000 [to supplement] and that’s a lot of money,” Ed Walker, Cap Francais’ trainer, said. “We’ll watch the other trials and might even take in another trial [with him]. There are loads of options for him but given the remit which Mr Pearce left, it’s a tough one. If we’d won half a length, there would be no question [about going for the Derby]. Maybe he is not a horse for the Derby, but for another Derby, maybe in Ireland.”
