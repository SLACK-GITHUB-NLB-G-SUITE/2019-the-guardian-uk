A prequel to the revered musical Grease is in development, according to the Hollywood Reporter. John August, who wrote the film Big Fish and worked on the forthcoming Aladdin live-action remake, is writing the script. No director or cast are attached to the project yet. The film will expand on the holiday romance enjoyed by high school students Danny and Sandy, alluded to in the song Summer Nights, which recounts the tendresse with contrasting sentimentality (from Sandy) and frankness (from Danny). A huge success on its release in 1978, Grease remains a key cultural touchstone and its soundtrack, with hits such as Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights and Youâ€™re the One That I Want, is one of the bestselling albums of all time. A sequel, released in 1982, was less well received.
