The thing about Violet is that she’s always laughing. That’s why, I think, she has lived so long. When my father-in-law died 18 years ago, she came to live with my wife and me. Then my wife died nearly eight years ago and, at that point, I say I inherited Violet. She will be 100 in September. I used to work away from home a lot, but I don’t any more. I worry about leaving her alone in the house overnight. We talk about my daughter a lot, and my grandchild, and we have video calls with them on WhatsApp. I never thought, when I first met Violet, that this is how things would work out. I never expected my wife, who was six years younger than me, to go first. Everything’s out of order. But life’s not so bad, really. We have got used to each other now. I think the secret to living well is not arguing all the time. But if Richard does something that I don’t like, I speak my mind. We don’t have rows, but we do have our differences. Overall, he’s not too bad. Of course, I moved here to be close to my daughter. Why things happen the way they do, I do not know. I never imagined I’d end up living with Richard when my daughter first introduced us. My first impression of him, I still remember, was that he was very tall. But I approved of him from the start. I thought, “Ah yes, that’s the one.” I said, “You’ve got a nice young man there.” I feel much closer to him now than I did then. It gives me peace of mind, just knowing he is there. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
