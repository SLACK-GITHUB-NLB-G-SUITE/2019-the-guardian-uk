Solange has cancelled her Coachella performance a week out from the Californian festival due to “major production delays”, organisers say. The R&B star was slated for two Saturday performances at the festival – on 13 and 20 April – but on Sunday night it was confirmed both would be cancelled. Solange offered “her sincerest apologies”, according to a statement from Coachella. “[Solange] sends her sincerest apologies, and looks forward to performing at Coachella in the future,” the statement said. Due to major production delays, Solange will unfortunately no longer be performing at this year's festival. She sends her sincerest apologies, and looks forward to performing at Coachella in the future. No further information has been provided about the nature of the delays. On Saturday, a stagehand died at the festival site after an accident during set-up, but there is no indication that either were linked. Solange Knowles released her fourth album – When I Get Home – last month, and was announced as a major act for Coachella in January. The festival previously also dropped rapper Kanye West from the lineup days before the January announcement because he made a demand for a new custom-built dome stage at the last minute. This year’s Coachella will be headlined by rapper Childish Gambino, singer Ariana Grande, and Australian psychedelic rock band Tame Impala.
