In 1974 Diarmuid Lawrence and I were on the same BBC film directors’ training course, and he made a great impression not just as a creative person but also as a kind man. He acted for me in one exercise based on a short script that I had written and was a joy to work with – I always thought he could have made a good career as an actor, although maybe he should have been a diplomat. There was a determined feminist on the course who repeatedly challenged one of the lecturers, who was undeniably “old school”. He was telling us how to light a woman so she looked “soft and feminine” and how to emphasise a man’s jaw-line to make him “look strong”. Some of the men in attendance took exception to the continual objections from said feminist, crying out: “Can’t we just get on with it?” The atmosphere became quite acrimonious until Dee spoke up in such a softly spoken and conciliatory tone of voice everyone took heed and the angry mood was dispelled. I imagine he got good performances from such a huge range of actors across the decades through the people skills he displayed on that occasion, treating everyone with respect.
