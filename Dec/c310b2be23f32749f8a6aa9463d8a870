Stormzy has defended himself after Piers Morgan took issue with him criticising Boris Johnson to a group of children. The UK grime star was talking to young pupils at his old primary school in Thornton Heath, south London, when he was asked why he was not a fan of the prime minister. He replied that Johnson was “a very, very bad man”. The kid asked me a question and I replied truthfully nothing wrong with that Piers lol https://t.co/OgPGWwCxY8 Stormzy, who was a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn in the run-up to the general election, also compared Johnson to the “big, bad wolf”. Good Morning Britain presenter Morgan was quick to comment, tweeting: “He shouldn’t have done this, and shouldn’t have been allowed to do this.” Stormzy responded: “The kid asked me a question and I replied truthfully nothing wrong with that Piers lol.” Morgan replied that the music star should use his power “more carefully”, saying: “Come off it Stormzy – saying stuff like that to a bunch of very young schoolkids isn’t cool, and you know it. “You’re a hugely influential role model now to so many youngsters. Wield that power more carefully.” Stormzy replied: “No, it isn’t cool, it’s the truth lol. Again, they asked me a question and I answered it truthfully and with jest. “I gave em my opinion. They’ll grow up and be able to make their own. This ain’t a shocking incident pal sorry lol.” Before the election, Stormzy urged his fans to vote for Labour and described Johnson as a “fucking prick” in an impassioned video to his 2.7 million Instagram followers. He said Corbyn was “a man of hope, a man of justice, a man of equality”.
