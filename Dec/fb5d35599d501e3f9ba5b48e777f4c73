Vivianne Miedema scored six and provided four assists as Arsenal demolished Bristol City 11-1 for the biggest victory in the Women’s Super League’s nine-year history – surpassing Liverpool’s 9-0 against Doncaster Belles in the 2013 season. The Dutch striker’s double hat-trick took her tally to 23 goals across all competitions to overtake Chelsea’s Ji So-yun as the highest scoring non-British player in the WSL. Lisa Evans scored twice, while Jordon Nobbs, Leah Williamson and Emma Mitchell all chipped in as Arsenal flattened Tanya Oxtoby’s side. Manuela Zinsberger saved Yana Daniels’ penalty but Daniels scored the rebound for City’s goal. The result puts Arsenal ahead of Manchester City on goal difference, with both teams jumping ahead of Chelsea after their game against Everton was postponed due to a frozen pitch. West Ham came from behind twice to beat Manchester United for their third win of the season. WSL player of the month for October, Kirsty Hanson, headed the visiting team ahead in the first minute but Laura Vetterlein replied for the Hammers in the third. The 18-year-old Lauren James again put United in front with 10 minutes to play but two goals from German Katharina Baunach, either side of teammate Leanne Kiernan’s sending off after a second yellow, ensured the London team took the three points. Man United remain fifth, three points behind Everton who now have a game in hand over United.
