I signed off last time saying that this column would return on 6 January. I hope you’ll see why I’ve popped back before Christmas. It’s frequently asked of setters and solvers: what is your favourite cryptic clue? One answer you hear a lot is this, from the Guardian’s Araucaria, who died in 2013: 2d/3d/4d/5d/21d/20d/16d/23d/19d O hark! the herald angels sing the Boy’s descent which lifted up the world (anag), and in what circumstances (5,9,7,5,6,2,5,3,6,2,3,6) Indeed, I mentioned it myself, a decade ago, before I joined this parish. A 59-letter anagram is perhaps daunting, but there are plenty of crossing letters, and the answer is very familiar. But where is the puzzle in which this clue first appeared? Araucaria himself was “modestly proud” of the anagram, but … … couldn’t for the life of him remember where or when it had been appeared. And, unlike most other setters, he never kept any record of his past puzzles, let alone any index of his past clues. This way of working was why all his puzzles were so fresh. Happily, since then, the technology to find such things has progressed. To the rescue come Chameleon, inventor of the cluedoku and Soup, the editor of crossword magazine 1 Across, who have located a copy. So, here it is, in online and printable form: Guardian 16,176. A regular weekday puzzle; no prize. And when it was published, there was no fancy technology for the setter, who preferred to use Scrabble tiles for anagrams. Perhaps the reverend benefitted from divine intervention. Some clues are of their era, you’ll note. And if I’ve mis-transcribed anything, I’m sure you’ll let me know. Thank you Soup, and Merry Christmas to all.
