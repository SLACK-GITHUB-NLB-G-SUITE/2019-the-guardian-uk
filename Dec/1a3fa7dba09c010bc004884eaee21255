“Home Work is sweetly old-fashioned and the perfect present for the in-law in your life,” your piece on celebrity books of the year says (Review, 30 November). How disappointing to be fobbed off with the “opaque cliche” of Julie Andrews’ biography when I could have been reading Debbie Harry’s “terrific” book or Elton John’s “celebrity memoir of the year”. Note to my offsprings’ partners: I don’t want slippers or bath cubes either.Jane BakowskiTunbridge Wells, Kent • Simon Jenkins’ article (This election will be all about identity. The Tories know it, Journal, 29 November) reminded me of an incident when I was knocking on doors canvassing for the Doncaster local elections in 1975. A man came to the door and explained: “I have always voted Labour. But I’ve bought a car. And now that I’m a motorist I think I should vote Conservative.”Digby SewellDriffield, East Yorkshire • Michael Horan’s praise of the use of “attendant” (Letters, 29 November) overlooks the fact that the meaning of “attendee” is universally understood. Does he prefer to think of himself as a “pedant” or a “pedee”?Ian BroadbridgeBristol • We’ve just had Black Friday.
