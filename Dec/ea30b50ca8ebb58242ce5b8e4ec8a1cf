Tesco has recalled thousands of jars of Heinz baby food from its stores in the UK after sharp metal fragments were found in a single jar. Enforcement agencies, including the Food Standards Agency, have launched an investigation amid evidence that the jar was tampered with. The 200g By Nature jars affected are suitable for babies aged seven months and older. Eight varieties on sale at Tesco are being recalled; sweet & sour chicken, mango chicken curry, cottage pie, cheesy & tomato pasta stars, Sunday chicken dinner, spaghetti bolognese, winter veggies & lamb and pasta bake with tuna. Heinz and Tesco said in a joint statement: “Safety is our No 1 priority. Products in the range were removed from sale immediately and we are taking this voluntary recall action as a precaution. We regret that this incident has happened and are sorry for the concern and the inconvenience that this recall may cause.” Shoppers are advised not to use the Heinz 7+ months baby food jars purchased from Tesco and to return any jars to Tesco stores where they were bought for a full refund. The recall involves only the named eight varieties sold in Tesco stores, and no other Tesco or branded baby products are affected. Shoppers are being told it is safe to buy Heinz 7+ months jars from all other retailers, while no other Heinz baby foods in jars or other packs (eg pouches) are involved. The statement said consumers can continue to use these products bought from other stores “in complete confidence”. Worried consumers are advised to contact the Heinz careline team at www.heinz.co.uk/contact-us or telephone 0800 731 1477. Earlier this year, the rival brand Cow & Gate recalled baby food sold at Asda, Tesco, and Boots because some jars contained pieces of rubber.
