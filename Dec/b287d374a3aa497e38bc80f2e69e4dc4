Microsoft has revealed the name for its new games console – Xbox Series X. The machine, previously known by the codename Project Scarlett will launch in “Holiday 2020”, and will ship with a redesigned version of the Xbox wireless controller. The new name was announced during the annual Game awards in Los Angeles. At the event, a promotional trailer was shown for Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, a sequel to the critically acclaimed adventure title from UK developer Ninja Theory, which is being designed to leverage the capabilities of the new technology. In a blog post, Xbox chief Phil Spencer introduced the Xbox Series X as “our fastest, most powerful console ever”, claiming it will set a new bar for performance and speed. “Its industrial design enables us to deliver four times the processing power of Xbox One X in the most quiet and efficient way, something that is critically important in delivering truly immersive gameplay.” The specifications of the machine were revealed earlier this year, including its custom AMD Zen 2 processor, capable of delivering visuals at 4K resolution and at 60 frames per second, with the possibility of 120fps rates and supporting 8K displays. The machine features a solid-state drive to allow for faster loading times. According to Microsoft, it can be stood vertically or horizontally. The Xbox Series X is also set to offer backwards compatibility with Xbox One and previous Xbox machines. No official release date has been given beyond the Holiday 2020 announcement, the same period that Sony is set to launch its competing PlayStation 5 machine.
