Last year, I was lucky to be playing again  …  to now be the champion, 22 years between wins, it’s a long time. But it’s just unreal for me to experience this. When the crowd is chanting 'Roger' I hear 'Novak'. It sounds silly, but it is like that. Sometimes I wonder how I do it. I feel like it’s just not me. I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I’m going crazy. You cannot be thinking ‘one more’ all the time, otherwise you are never happy. You want more money, a bigger house, a new boat, an even prettier girlfriend! You cannot be happy like that – I don’t like the frustration. You have to thank life for all that it gives you. You just feel light. You feel everything is beautiful I said to him: ‘Enjoy it, soak it all up and don’t worry about crying, because all real men cry.’ Not bad for a boy from a Stevenage council house. I’m just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has just come true. I started counting my steps and my head was gone, I think I lost sight in one eye. I just couldn't lift my legs at all and I just couldn't move. Your message is excluding people. You're excluding me. You're excluding people that look like me. You're excluding people of colour. You're excluding Americans that maybe support you. I think that we need to have a reckoning with the message that you have and what you're saying about, 'Make America Great Again' I never dreamed of a day like this at all. When I was a kid all I was thinking about was getting my next meal.
