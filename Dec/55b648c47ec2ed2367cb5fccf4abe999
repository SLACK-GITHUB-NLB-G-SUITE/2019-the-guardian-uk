Liverpool are in advanced talks with Red Bull Salzburg to sign the Japan forward Takumi Minamino for £7.25m, with it reported on Thursday night that a deal has been agreed that will see the player join the Champions League holders on 1 January. The 24-year-old impressed ­Jürgen Klopp and his players over two games in the Champions League group stages and ­Liverpool appear to have taken advantage of the low release clause in the player’s contract in order to get the deal done next month. The Salzburg sporting director, Christoph Freund, said yesterday there had been discussions with ­Liverpool. “I can confirm there are talks. It is an honour for us to see the calibre of clubs who are interested in our players.” 🗣️ Christoph #Freund zum aktuellen Gerücht um Takumi #Minamino: Ich kann bestätigen, dass es aktuell Gespräche mit Liverpool gibt. Es ist eine Ehre, welche Vereine sich für unsere Spieler interessieren. Minamino joined Salzburg from Cerezo Osaka in 2015 and has scored 41 goals in 129 league games for the Austrian side. Liverpool qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League with a 2-0 win at Salzburg on Tuesday during which Minamino was a constant threat. He also caused Liverpool problems in the game at Anfield, when Liverpool led 3-0 only to be pegged back to 3-3 by their opponents before Mohamed Salah scored a winning goal for the hosts on 69 minutes. Minamino scored Salzburg’s second goal of the game. Liverpool face a hectic schedule as they attempt to defend their European crown as well as trying to win the ­English top-flight title for the first time since 1990. They are playing in the Carabao Cup and the Club World Cup next week and the FA Cup in January. Bayern Munich and Marseille are also thought to be interested in acquiring Minamino but Liverpool appear to have stolen a march in the pursuit of the forward’s signature, with it reported that a couple of Liverpool’s players, namely Jordan Henderson and Virgil van Dijk, urged Klopp to sign the player after the game in midweek.
