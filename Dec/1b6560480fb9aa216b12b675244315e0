A huge bang heard across London and in Hertfordshire just after 4am on Sunday was caused by RAF jets going supersonic, the Met and the MoD said. “Two Typhoon fighter aircraft from RAF Coningsby were scrambled at 0409 this morning, as part of the UK’s Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) procedures, after an aircraft lost communications in UK airspace,” said the Ministry of Defence. “The aircraft was intercepted and its communications were subsequently re-established. The Typhoons are returning to their base.” Flight tracking sites showed that two Typhoons took off from RAF Coningsby around the time of the noise.

People living in Essex, west London and Stevenage were among those tweeting to say they had been woken by the noise, and Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue said it received a “large number” of calls about the incident.
