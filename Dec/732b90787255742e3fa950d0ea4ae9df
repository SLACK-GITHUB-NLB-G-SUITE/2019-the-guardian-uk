The election results make it clear that Tory MPs will comprise the many and Labour will be the few in the next parliament. Here is how the papers cover it this morning. “Labour in meltdown as Johnson seizes majority” – that’s the Guardian after a calamitous election result for Jeremy Corbyn. The paper gets into its final edition the Labour leader’s speech saying he will not lead the party into the next election – but intends to cling to the helm to oversee a “period of reflection”. “Johnson unleashed” says the i, adding “Brexit in 49 days after Midlands and North tire of delay”. Johnson unleashed.

The Mail in its final edition enthuses that Conservative voters should “Rejoice! Boris surges to landslide win”. But the Mirror calls the outcome a “Nightmare before Xmas” as it laments the “worst Labour result since 1935”.
