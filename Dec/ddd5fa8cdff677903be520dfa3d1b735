Deshaun Watson threw three touchdown passes and had the first TD reception of his career, and the Houston Texans frustrated Tom Brady in a 28-22 victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday night. Texans coach and former Patriots assistant Bill O’Brien got his first win in six tries against New England coach Bill Belichick. It was only Houston’s second win over the Patriots and first since 2010. Watson had 234 yards passing and threw touchdown passes as Houston (8-4) built a 21-3 lead against New England’s vaunted defense. Brady completed two of his three TD passes in the final four minutes to pull within six. A Patriots (10-2) player got a hand on Jake Bailey’s onside kick attempt with 50 seconds remaining, but the ball bounced out of bounds. James White had a 12-yard reception for New England’s first touchdown late in the third quarter, but Watson grabbed the first reception of his career on a flip from DeAndre Hopkins on a trick play with about 10 minutes left to make it 28-9. The Patriots entered needing a win to be the first AFC team to clinch a playoff spot. Instead, they struggled to sustain drives, and Brady often looked upset on a night he was 24 of 47. He threw an interception and was sacked three times, hit on 12 other occasions and was seen yelling at his receivers on the sideline after a drive with several incompletions in the first half. He finished with 326 yards. New England dealt with a flu bug this week that swept through the locker room and left two players inactive on Sunday.
