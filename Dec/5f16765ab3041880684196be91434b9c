When I was 19 or 20 I went to a reading Alasdair Gray gave in Aberdeen, and I came away from that reading knowing that anything and everything were possible in writing. Scottish writing was in revolution and Gray was the heart of a literary renaissance which revitalised everything. He was an artist in every form. He was a renaissance man. His generosity and brilliance in person – felt by everyone who knew him even a little – were a source of astonishing and liberating warmth. The few times I met him in life, he was all these things in a unique combination of polite, frank, detached (or maybe more truly differently attached), sanguine, many-voiced, wise, warm, kind, hilarious, acutely truth-telling, uncompromisingly articulate. The way that all these things entered his literary work transformed and energised the possibilities across language, form and vision, broke open expectations of voice and shape in everything – in the novel, the story, the political or historical philosophy, the poem, the play, the critique, in everything aesthetic it touched, yes, but above all in the life. Gray’s vision is always rooted in his anatomising of – and his astute and never sentimental hope for the reshaping of – any given social structure that fails its people in terms of the humane. His aesthetic mantra is profoundly communal: Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation. That’s his legacy, written on us all, and as ever with Gray, who was a magnificent talent, a modern-day William Blake, it’ll never be more timely, more necessary, more vital, more crucial and generous a gift, than it is right now and for the future.
