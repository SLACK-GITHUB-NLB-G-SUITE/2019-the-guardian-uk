UK Anti-Doping has withdrawn a charge against Dillian Whyte after clearing the British boxer of any wrongdoing.The 31-year-old provided a sample on June 20 - a month before his heavyweight title fight with Oscar Rivas at the O2 in London - that contained “trace amounts” of steroid metabolites. However, UKAD has determined that the metabolite levels contained in that sample are “consistent with an isolated contamination event, and they are not suggestive of doping.”A statement read: “Having rigorously scrutinised and investigated the detailed factual and scientific evidence provided by Mr Whyte, UKAD is satisfied that the presence of the very low amounts of metabolites in his June 20 2019 sample was not caused by any fault, negligence or wrongdoing on Mr Whyte’s part and, given the circumstances, could not have affected the fight between Mr Whyte and Mr Rivas on July 20 2019.”Whyte posted a picture of the statement on Twitter and wrote: “For those who believed in me I won’t forget you. To those who didn’t, I won’t forgive you and I know who you are.”Jamaica-born Whyte beat Colombian fighter Rivas on points in July, having recovered from a ninth-round knockdown.He will fight Polish heavyweight Mariusz Wach on the undercard of the Anthony Joshua v Andy Ruiz Jr. rematch in Saudi Arabia on Saturday night. The British Boxing Board of Control has been informed of the resolution of the proceedings, UKAD said.
