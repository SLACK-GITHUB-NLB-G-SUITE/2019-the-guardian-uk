I am 81 with heart problems – which means I am a top priority if my phone needs to be repaired – but have been trying unsuccessfully to get my BT landline fixed. I have wireless broadband provided by WiSpire, a local firm, so I could email a friend in Yorkshire who was able to report the fault for me. I tried to go online with BT to track the fault, but it has been impossible. It tells you to ring a free number but how can I if my phone will not work? I put in my phone number and BT account number online but BT says it does not exist. My neighbours, who live half a mile away, are in the same boat. I was finally told a BT engineer would call yesterday but they didn’t. I have lived here since 1984 and never been cut off. JB, Dereham, Norfolk We gather you were reconnected in early December. BT is reliant on Openreach to organise engineering visits as it handles any infrastructure issues. BT says: “We’re really sorry for the interruption to JB’s landline and for any distress caused. A tree fell on an overhead telephone cable disconnecting the line. “Due to poor lighting conditions we had to rearrange the initial engineer visit. This caused a slight delay and we’ve compensated JB with one month’s line rental.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
