A few things let me know I’m getting ready for Christmas (aside from obviously going to Mass every day, ahem). I order my panettone (from Nudo) and buy some Bendicks Bittermints (£3.50) which are, for me, the perfect mint-choc combination. The fierce 95% chocolate disc is totally tamed by the sugary, minty iciness within. I love the ritual of unwrapping one every day before Christmas and convincing myself that the mint makes them a digestive aid, ergo quasi-medicinal. Some alternatives, if we must. Divine Smooth Dark Chocolate Thins (£4) have 65% cocoa and a fondant centre. They’re my favourite ‘thins’. Summerdown Mint Chocolate Peppermint Truffles (£12.50) are hard balls of 55% cocoa with traditional English Black Mitcham peppermint: very thickly chocolatey and far more subtle than any other minty chocolate I’ve tried. If you fancy something more fondant-centred, try Beech’s After Dinner Mints (£4.99). The Prestat Mint Box (£14) has something a bit different: coffee mints, double mints and strawberry mints: these make a neat little present. Talking of presents, I can’t believe that, two weeks ago, I forgot to mention my favourite Christmas chocolate thing, the Hotel Chocolat 50% Small Festive Chocolate Wreath (£8), dark milk in a chunky format with bits of cookies and nuts therein, all in a little box. If you need to bring a small gift to someone who you don’t know that well (although, obviously, make sure they are not nut-allergic), this is perfect.
