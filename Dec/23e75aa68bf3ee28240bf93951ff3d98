The former Macclesfield manager Sol Campbell wants the club to be wound up because debts have not been paid, a judge has heard. Judge Catherine Addy was told on Wednesday that Macclesfield owed a “very large” amount of tax and owed Campbell more than £180,000. Tax officials have asked for the club to be wound up and Campbell, who is now the manager of Southend, supported that application, lawyers told Addy. The judge was given updates on the League Two club’s debt problems at a hearing in the specialist insolvency and companies court in London. She said Macclesfield should get time to clear debts and said the case would be reconsidered on 18 December. Barrister Raj Arumugam, who represented HM Revenue & Customs, asked the judge to make a winding-up order. He did not say how much tax Macclesfield owed but the judge said the sum was “very large”. Barrister Philip Currie, who represented Campbell, said Macclesfield owed his client about £182,000. He said Campbell also wanted the club to be wound up. Barrister Sam Hodge, who represented Macclesfield, told of money transaction difficulties. He said there had been issues moving “large sums” from a director’s account in Spain. Mr Hodge said a payment made to HMRC had “bounced back”. The judge said if “banking transaction problems” continued she wanted them to be explained in detail in writing. Addy earlier adjourned a case involving Bury until 18 December. Lawyers representing HMRC had made an application to wind up the club.
