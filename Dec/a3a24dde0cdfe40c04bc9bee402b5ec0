For Sama, the acclaimed documentary about life under siege in the Syrian city of Aleppo, has unexpectedly triumphed at the British independent film awards, winning the top prize, best British independent film, as well as best documentary and best director for Waad al-Kateab and Edward Watts. Described by the Guardian’s Mike McCahill as a film to “break your heart and sear your soul”, For Sama is a chronicle filmed by Syrian activist-director al-Kateab as Aleppo is targeted during the country’s ongoing civil war. Al-Kateab spends much of the time in a hospital where her husband, Hamza, works, recording the destruction and horror. For Sama won a total of four Bifas, including best editing – previously announced with other Bifa “craft” awards on 15 November. The Personal History of David Copperfield, adapted from the Dickens novel by Armando Iannucci, had led the nominations count with 11, and ended up with five: three previously announced (best casting, costume design and production design), plus best supporting actor for Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick, and best screenplay for Iannucci and Simon Blackwell. However, David Copperfield’s Dev Patel, who was arguably the favourite, lost out as best actor to Josh O’Connor for the infertility drama Only You. O’Connor has now won the award twice in three years, having taken it in 2017 for God’s Own Country. Best actress went to Renée Zellweger for her role as Judy Garland in Judy, the biopic of the troubled movie star. Only You went on to win a second award on the night: best debut director for Harry Wootliff. The Last Tree, the autobiographical fable from director Shola Amoo, also won two awards, for best supporting actress for Ruthxjiah Bellenea and most promising newcomer for its lead Sam Adewunmi. Bait, the Cornwall-set drama filmed in black and white, won best breakthrough producers for Kate Byers and Linn Waite.
