It is refreshing to see a record number of ethnic minority MPs in parliament. The 65 MPs from this background represent 10% of the makeup of the House of Commons. It’s important that politicians are drawn from all backgrounds and all communities, particularly as the UK is becoming increasingly diverse. Politics is often rebuked for lagging behind business, but it is interesting to note that ethnic diversity in the corporate sector compares unfavourably to our new-look Commons. Less than 8% of FTSE 100 directors are from ethnic minority backgrounds. We have come a long way since the first ethnic minority MP, Dadabhai Naoroji, was elected in 1892. Last week’s election has produced a more diverse and ethnically representative Commons, and we should celebrate that.Dr Peter Chadha and Zaki CooperCo-chairs, Indian Jewish Association • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
