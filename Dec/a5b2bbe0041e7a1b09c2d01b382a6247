She may be known as one of the sexiest women in the world, but even Sharon Stone can’t catch a break with online dating. Writing on Twitter, the actor complained to the dating app Bumble that she had been blocked from the service after her account was deemed to be fake. “I went on the @bumble dating sight [sic] and they closed my account. Some users reported that it couldn’t possibly be me! Hey @bumble, is being me exclusionary? Don’t shut me out of the hive.” I went on the @bumble dating sight and they closed my account. 👁👁Some users reported that it couldn’t possibly be me! Hey @bumble, is being me exclusionary ? 🤷🏼‍♀️Don’t shut me out of the hive 🐝 She included a screenshot of her account after it was closed, where a statement had been posted: “Your account has been blocked because we’ve received several reports about your profile being fake.” Bumble’s editorial director Clare O’Connor replied to Stone, unblocking her account and apologising for the error. Stone, 61, became a global sex symbol after the release of 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct, and had further film hits with Total Recall, Casino and The Quick and the Dead. She has been married and divorced twice, and also called off another engagement. She is now single, and has three sons with whom she lives in Los Angeles. In 2018, she dated Italian real estate agent Angelo Boffa, but the pair separated, with Stone saying later that year: “I think somewhere in the back of your mind you think maybe one day you won’t be a single parent, then, eventually you realise: I think it’s better. I’m no longer hoping for someone.” After posting her tweet to Bumble, she was inundated with replies offering dates. One post read: “If you’re ever in Buffalo and kinda dig fat guys with mustaches my DMs are open. Also own a car so willing to drive (up to 25 miles) even if ya just close by.”
