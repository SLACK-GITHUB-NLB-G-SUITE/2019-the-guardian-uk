The key play came with 8:50 remaining in the third quarter and the score tied at 17. Minnesota’s Dalvin Cook rushed up the middle, but the ball was knocked loose by Seahawks defensive lineman Rasheem Green and recovered by safety Bradley McDougald at the Vikings 26-yard line.

Shortly thereafter, Jason Myers kicked his second 29-yard field goal of the game to give Seattle its first lead at 20-17. Cook finished with nine carries for 29 yards and a touchdown. He also logged three receptions for 35 yards. With Seattle trailing 17-10 at the half, Penny scored on a one-yard run to tie it on the Seahawks’ first possession of the third quarter.
