A woman running on a Gold Coast beach has been rescued after becoming stuck in masses of cornflake seaweed that has piled up thigh-deep in places. A seaweed expert, Pia Winberg, said the bloom of Colpomenia – also known as sea potatoes, oyster thief or cornflake seaweed – was not unusual for this time of year. But its scale, the marine biologist said, was unprecedented. “We have not seen bigger blooms than the one you’ve got on the Gold Coast at the moment,” she said. Videos posted on social media on Wednesday showed tourists, locals and an excited dog playing in the seaweed. A passerby came to the aid of one local runner after she became stuck in thick seaweed that had washed up at Palm Beach.

She said the piles on the beaches could take more than a month to decompose, and could be put to good use as a compost additive. Gold Coast beaches have a new attraction but not a popular one. As the Summer holidays approach mounds of 'cornflake' seaweed have washed ashore, so deep some swimmers are getting stuck in it. https://t.co/VZ3A1cpmr5 #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/a0yI5Cx1MA “It doesn’t make sense to scrape it up and put it in a waste pile,” she said. The seaweed was important to the natural ecology, she said, feeding marine ecosystems and increasing local fish stocks. Gold Coast city council said it would work with the Queensland government if management of the seaweed was required. “The city is actively monitoring the accumulation of seaweed on our beaches,” it said. “At this point in time no maintenance work is proposed to remove the seaweed.”
