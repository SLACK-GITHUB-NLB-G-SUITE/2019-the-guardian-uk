After having side-parts in a ton of Marvel films, Scarlett Johannson’s KGB-trained assassin Natasha Romanoff gets her own standalone movie. Apparently set shortly after Captain America: Civil War, this also has meaty roles for Rachel Weisz and Florence Pugh, and is directed by Cate Shortland. Patty Jenkins follows up her smash-hit movie with this sequel which – as it says on the tin – is set in 1984. Gal Gadot is back as the Amazonian demigod, taking on feline nasty Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) and super-rich businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal). A Suicide Squad spinoff built around the success of Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn character, here leading a crew of femme vigilantes to protect a young girl from horrible crime boss Black Mask (Ewan McGregor). Angelina Jolie makes her MCU debut in a battle-for-the-ages saga: she’s one of the godlike alien beings (along with Richard Madden, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani) who protect humanity during the millennia-long conflict with the Deviants. After the slightly unexpected success of Tom Hardy’s alien-symbiote story, the Sony Marvel series was up and running. This sequel, directed by Andy Serkis, has Hardy going toe to toe with another symbiote, Woody Harrelson’s serial killer Carnage. Likely the last in the X-Men series, this has a bunch of young mutants – Magik, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Sunspot and Mirage – fight their way out of a holding centre where they are being kept prisoner. Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams star. Another Spider-Man spinoff (see Venom 2); here featuring the scientist-turned-vampire Michael Morbius, as played by Jared Leto. Not much has leaked out as to the storyline, but Matt Smith stars as Morbius’s vampiric pal Loxias Crown and Tyrese Gibson as an FBI agent looking for him. Vin Diesel stars as the resurrected murder victim turned killing machine, who starts getting flashbacks to his previous life and sets out for revenge, only to find himself enmeshed in a much bigger conspiracy.
