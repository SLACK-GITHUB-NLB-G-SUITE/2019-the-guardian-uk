Five people have been confirmed killed, a figure that is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand’s Whakaari/White Island. New Zealand police do not believe there are any survivors left on the island and are “urgently” working to confirm the exact number of those who have died. They earlier said as many as 27 people had been stranded on the island. Police and rescue crews have still not been able to access the island, after advice from volcano experts. “The physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island,” said John Tims, the deputy commissioner of New Zealand police. A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns. Photographs in the aftermath of the eruption appear to show a wrecked helicopter on the island. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. Thirty to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred at about 2.11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, on the North Island. Whakaari/White Island is New Zealand’s most active cone volcano, and is a popular tourist destination and scientific research site. It last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016.
