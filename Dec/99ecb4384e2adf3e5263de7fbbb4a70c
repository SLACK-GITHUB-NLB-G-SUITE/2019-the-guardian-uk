The Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Braut Haaland is considering offers from Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig after visiting the two Bundesliga clubs but is expected to hold talks with Manchester United and Juventus before deciding on his future. Dortmund and RB Leipzig are pushing hard to get a deal done in January, with the latter helped by having the same owners as Salzburg. The player has a release clause of around €25m (£21.2m) but Salzburg value the young Norwegian at closer to €60m and would benefit from a bidding war. Whoever signs Haaland would also have to pay a hefty commission to the player’s representative, Mino Raiola. Haaland’s main priority is to find a club where he will start as many games as possible. The player and his family, including his father Alf-Inge, the former Manchester City and Leeds midfielder, are concerned that playing time would be limited at United, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial there, and at Juventus, who have Cristiano Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higuaín and Paulo Dybala. United and Juventus have not given up though and are two of the clubs in Europe who have the best relationship with Raiola. They are both prepared to offer the 19-year-old a lucrative five-year deal. Haaland has scored 28 goals in 22 games for his club this season and it is more likely he will leave in the summer than in January. He joined the Austrian side from Molde for €9m last January. Salzburg confirmed on Thursday that they were in talks with Liverpool over the possible sale of the Japanese forward Takumi Minamino, who has a release clause of £7.25m.
