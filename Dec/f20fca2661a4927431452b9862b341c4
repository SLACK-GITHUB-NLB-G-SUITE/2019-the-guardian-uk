Jadon Sancho scored for the seventh successive game before hobbling off as Borussia Dortmund blew a two-goal lead in a 3-3 draw with the Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig. A brilliant first-half showing was rewarded with a 2-0 half-time lead thanks to goals from Julian Weigl and Julian Brandt, with the England international claiming an assist. Timo Werner’s quickfire double at the start of the second half brought Leipzig level, only for Sancho to regain his side’s advantage with his 12th goal of the campaign in all competitions. But the 19-year-old’s night ended soon after as he went off injured. The hosts could not see it out as Patrick Schick levelled again for Leipzig with 12 minutes remaining and Lucien Favre’s side missed the chance to close the gap on Leipzig to one point. A stunning first-half blitz from Mainz, where Robin Quaison fired a hat-trick, set up a 5-0 demolition of Werder Bremen. Quiason needed only 10 minutes to open the scoring and – after Jiri Pavlenka put through his own net four minutes later – and he grabbed his second before 20 minutes were on the clock. Quiason completed his treble seven minutes before the break to put his side in complete control. Mainz managed only one goal after the restart as Jean-Philippe Mateta netted after 81 minutes. Augsburg made it three wins on the spin with a 3-0 beating of Fortuna Düsseldorf, with Philipp Max grabbing a double and Tin Jedvaj also scoring. Second-half goals from Ihlas Bebou and Christoph Baumgartner gave Hoffenheim a 2-0 win at Union Berlin.
