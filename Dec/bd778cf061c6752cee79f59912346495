Social media exposure has utterly transformed the way television markets itself. A cynic might say that while in the early 2010s TV moments went viral by happenstance, by the end of the decade, producers had a constant eye on what might make a shareable clip. Here’s our list of the greatest viral TV gold of the decade. Adam Woodyatt should have insisted on some kind of personal royalty for every time someone shared this clip of Ian Beale’s 2014 weeping meltdown to indicate they were upset about something. The trend for having a researcher on hand to promptly pin a poppy on anybody within a few feet of the cameras reached its nadir when the Cookie Monster found itself festooned.

Or appeared on live TV holding a wodge of A4 paper instead of the iPad you were meant to be presenting with? Style it out, mate. Style it out. Really, really angry. In case you missed it, here's Bob Katter's alternative view on the #samesexmarriage debate. Thanks for watching. #Insiders #auspol pic.twitter.com/iObsR1tDs1 The strangest offshoot of the death of David Bowie. His former wife Angie was in the Celebrity Big Brother house when she was informed of the news in 2016. She announced “David’s dead!”, which led to a series of mixups that wouldn’t look out of place in a theatrical farce, culminating in most of the inmates thinking fellow Big Brother contestant David Gest had died in his sleep in the room next door. Gest awoke somewhat surprised to find people hysterically checking his pulse. It wasn’t just that Steve Coogan was made up to pull off a remarkably distorted mirror of himself, but more that he managed to get Come Out Ye Black and Tans lodged as a national earworm by broadcasting it on BBC One. Or, as Irish Alan put it, “Double O fekkin’ bollocks”. Not even the person doing the interview could concentrate, because they’d put a dog on live television news and captioned him “Bounce. Dog.” “I just need to digest it, and get it in my nut, and then I can move on with my life.” We’ll never be able to look at a British royal family tree again without muttering “Philippa plant a gannett”. If Viz comic was writing daytime TV segments, they’d be hard pressed to come up with something as bizarre as the moment on This Morning where they used a ‘psychic banana’ to guess the gender of the next royal baby. Even more weirdly, the banana got it right. According to the psychic banana, it's a boy! 🍌#royalbaby @hollywills @Schofe pic.twitter.com/z9YL3uXblX Speaking of gender reveals, the Doctor Who gender-flip trailer was aired and widely shared after the men’s Wimbledon final. It also spawned a generation of angry internet fanboys raging #NotMyDoctor as they decided they could cope with the concept of a two-hearted time-travelling alien who could change their face … just as long as they had a penis. Imagine it. One election day you wake up, expecting to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. A few hours after that, you find you aren’t even going to be an MP any more. Ed Balls did the only decent thing anyone could do in that situation – Gangnam Style on Strictly. One of those rare exceptions whose every weekly appearance on Strictly made him less endearing to the public, Mike Bushell threw his all into this interview with England’s Commonwealth Games swimmers, literally throwing himself into the pool in the process. All hail Gemma Collins for bringing us this Dancing on Ice moment, in which she executed one of the greatest precision moves of slapstick comedy of all time. Going into Monday like Gemma Collins on Dancing on Ice... 😂 Dead! #DancingOnIce pic.twitter.com/PHVGIwNVNo One of the key ingredients of a TV moment going viral is its remixability – and thanks to the turf acting like a green screen, Brazil’s Neymar hit the jackpot with a ludicrous exaggerated roll during the 2018 World Cup that sparked hundreds of re-edits, of which this was the greatest. Neymar keeps rolling rolling rolling rolling #WorldCup2018 (shoutout to @OMGItzJR for sending me the clip) pic.twitter.com/k7LuRW9JUj Also on a sporting tip, it is hard to remember that before the opening ceremony, everyone assumed the 2012 Olympic Games in London was going to be a shambles. Jeremy Hunt helped that image along with his antics a couple of weeks before. Hunt clutching the literal end of a bell. It writes itself. Some viral moments take years to mature. It was in a 2011 episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that Taylor Armstrong cried and pointed during a row while fellow cast member Kyle Richards tried to calm her down. It wasn’t until 2019 that someone paired the image with that of a confused cat sitting down at a restaurant, so it looked like she was shouting at it. Just like that, the year’s most viral meme was born. Ah Rylan, lovable Rylan, wonderfully re-invented as a national treasure and a Eurovision fixture. But first coming to our attention with an excruciating X Factor audition followed by a virtual nervous breakdown when judge Nicole Scherzinger told him he was through to the live shows. “You won, Jane. Enjoy the money, I hope it makes you very happy.” You could probably make a top 25 Come Dine With Me moments list on its own, but this rant is the standout viral moment from all 27 seasons of the show. Peter, shirt unnecessarily unbuttoned, goes from realising he has come last to delivering an eviscerating rant about his fellow contestants in a matter of seconds. “You ruined my night, completely, so you could have the money, but I hope now you spend it on getting some lessons in grace and decorum.” Some are born to political greatness, some aspire to it, and some, like Brenda from Bristol, have it thrust upon them. “You’re joking. Not another one! Oh for God’s sake!” She spoke for a nation in 2017 about the prospect of yet another election. What an epic entrance. There’s dad, calmly being an expert about world news, and in strides Marion Kelly, all swagger and attitude – like a tiny Liam Gallagher in a yellow jumper. Dad desperately tries to push her out of shot while continuing to discuss political tensions on the Korean peninsula. In the background, in scenes you’d reject from a sitcom writer for being too unlikely, a second child arrives propelling themselves on wheels, followed by the despairing flailing wife trying to rescue the situation. “I thought I’d blown it,” Professor Robert Kelly said of his career. May we all carry ourselves with young Marion Kelly’s confidence into the next decade.
