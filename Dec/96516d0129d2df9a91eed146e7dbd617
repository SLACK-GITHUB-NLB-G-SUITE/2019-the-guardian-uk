John Cooney’s long-range penalty two minutes from time secured a 25-24 Champions Cup comeback win for Ulster over Harlequins . Ulster trailed 24-22 in the closing stages after two second-half tries from the Quins hooker Elia Elia had edged the visitors in front. But an Adam McBurney try and Cooney’s conversion left Ulster within range and Cooney’s penalty made it three wins from three and left them on top of Pool 3. Sean Reidy and Stuart McCloskey claimed Ulster’s other tries along, both converted by Cooney, who also landed two penalties. Quins, who earned a losing bonus point, had a try from Alex Dombrandt, in addition to Elia’s double. Marcus Smith converted all three tries and added a penalty. Glasgow Warriors secured a 27-24 victory over La Rochelle at the Stade Marcel-Deflandre to move into second spot in Pool 2. Tries from Callum Gibbins, Nikola Matawalu and Kyle Steyn – along with 12 points from the boot of Adam Hastings – were enough to secure victory. Glasgow pulled themselves back into the game on the stroke of half-time. With Priso penalised for not rolling away, the visitors kicked for the corner. The driving lineout was well worked allowing Gibbins to power over from short range with Hastings converting meaning Glasgow trailed 18-13 at the interval. Steyn put Glasgow ahead as he ran in from 45 metres out after gathering a perfectly executed cross‑kick from Hastings, who converted to put the visitors 27-24 ahead with 15 minutes remaining. The Ospreys full-back Dan Evans was sent off after just 37 seconds for dangerous use of the boot as his team lost 40-19 to Racing 92 in Pool 4. It was Ospreys’ third loss in the competition this season. Lyon secured their first-ever victory in the Champions Cup with a 28-0 home win over Benetton Treviso in Pool 1. The French Top 14 side broke their duck at the ninth attempt and also registered a late bonus point into the bargain.
