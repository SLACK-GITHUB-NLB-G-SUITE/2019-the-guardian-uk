Red Bull Salzburg’s playmaker Takumi Minamino is due to have a medical at Liverpool on Wednesday before his proposed £7.25m move. Liverpool triggered the Japan international’s release clause last week, a couple of days after facing him for the second time in the Champions League group stage. Providing no problems are encountered it is understood the 24-year-old will sign his contract on Wednesday and become a Liverpool player on 1 January. It is anticipated Minamino would go straight into Jürgen Klopp’s squad and could be available for the FA Cup third-round tie at home to Everton four days later. The deal is viewed by Liverpool as outstandingly good value as they believe the player’s market value is three times what they are paying. The club have kept tabs on Minamino since 2013 and acted quickly when interest was expressed by Manchester United, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Milan. Minamino has scored nine times in 22 appearances this season.
