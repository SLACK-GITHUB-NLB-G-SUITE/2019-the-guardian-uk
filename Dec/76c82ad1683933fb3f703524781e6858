We are alarmed by the global rise of far-right nationalism and the authoritarian turn taken by many governments following the global financial crash of 2008. We are shamed by extreme levels of inequality, neglect and environmental impoverishment resulting from decades of neoliberalism, in Britain and across the world. We are inspired by growing movements, from Chile to Lebanon and beyond, calling for dignity, accountability and economic justice. People are demanding a future that promises their children decent education, health, jobs and homes, and humane and sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. In the UK, Labour’s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few. Boris Johnson’s Conservatives have nothing to offer but the prospect of an ever more unequal and divided society, and dog-whistle politics. Between hope and despair, the choice before British voters on 12 December could not be more stark or more urgent.Ronan Bennett Writer and producer, Noam Chomsky Author, Chipo Chung Actor, Clean Bandit Band, Steve Coogan Actor, Rob Delaney Actor, David Edgar Playwright, Brian Eno Musician, Andrew Feinstein Film producer, Stephen Frears Film director, David Graeber Author, Steve Gribbin Comedian, Kane “Kano” Robinson Rapper, Asif Kapadia Film director, Aki Kaurismaki Film director, Peter Kennard Artist, AL Kennedy Author, Naomi Klein Author, Mike Leigh Director, Ken Loach Film director, Lowkey Rapper, Sabrina Mahfouz Playwright, Esther Manito Comedian, Michael Mansfield Barrister, Francesca Martinez Comedian, Massive Attack Band, Bill McKibben Author and co-founder, 350.org, Robin Rimbaud (Scanner) Musician, Michael Rosen Poet, Martin Rowson Cartoonist, Mark Rylance Actor, Alexei Sayle Comedian, Gillian Slovo Writer, Robyn Slovo Film producer, Ahdaf Soueif Author, Joelle Taylor Poet, Kate Tempest Musician, Jess Thom Artistic director, Touretteshero, Mark Thomas Writer, Yanis Varoufakis Economist, Ashley Walters Actor, Roger Waters Musician, Benjamin Zephaniah Poet • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
