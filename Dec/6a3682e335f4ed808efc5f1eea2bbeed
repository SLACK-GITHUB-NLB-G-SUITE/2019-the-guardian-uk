The southbound carriageway of the M1 has been closed in West Yorkshire following a serious incident involving multiple vehicles, the third major crash on the motorway in 24 hours. West Yorkshire police said on Twitter on Christmas Day: “The M1 southbound is closed from junction 40 to 39 due to a RTC involving multiple vehicles. It is expected to be closed for several hours. Please avoid the area if you can.” Highways England said: “M1 southbound J40 Ossett to J39 Durkar closed due to a serious incident.” The incident follows a fatal collision 140 miles further south in Bedfordshire, late on Christmas Eve. A woman, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene following the crash, which happened between Aylesbury and Flitwick on the northbound carriageway at about 11.15pm, and involved a number of vehicles. Another person suffered minor injuries, police said. A stretch of the motorway was closed from Tuesday night until Wednesday morning after the crash near junction 12. Bedfordshire police attended the incident along with members of the ambulance service and fire brigade. Police are asking witnesses or anyone with information about the crash to call 101 and quote Operation Granborough. There was a further accident on the southbound carriageway in Hertfordshire, between Luton airport and Dunstable.
