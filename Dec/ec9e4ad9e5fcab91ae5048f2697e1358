Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I want to buy a balance bike for my two-year-old but the choice is enormous, with some up to £150. Are they really better than using stabilisers for teaching a child to cycle? What do I need to look for? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
