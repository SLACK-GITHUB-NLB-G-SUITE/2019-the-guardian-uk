Cox is known for his beguiling, gently comic writing about cats, family and landscape; this first fiction outing is a collection of stories that “often happen to maybe have a ghost in them”. Set against the backdrop of the Peak District, the tales feature trees that “looked like thin nervous men, uncertain about adulthood”, and buildings that are “a stone presence inside me that cannot be neglected for too long”. Folklore is used to draw attention to the landscape, and each story, though ordered non-sequentially, focuses on liminal spaces and characters. “Just Good Friends” is a quiet elegy on an unnervingly familiar but unrecognisable spirit; “Robot”, closer to a prose poem in style, describes an encounter between a hiker and a robot, and their trip to the future; and “Listings”, more impressionistic still, consists of – among other things – a collection of classified ads, a party invitation and an obituary: the reader must sift through this jumble of sources to glean the plot. Always unexpected, resisting simple explanation, these stories are a delight. • Help the Witch is published by Unbound (RRP £9.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&p over £15.
