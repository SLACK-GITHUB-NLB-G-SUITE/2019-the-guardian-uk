I am worried about one of my best friends. After we graduated, most of our friendship group relocated to London for work, but she stayed in our university town. She is going through a tough time; she doesn’t like her job, she doesn’t have many friends where she is and her boyfriend doesn’t treat her very well, but she insists she’s happy there. She doesn’t like to be alone – she has been in five relationships in the past three years, and I’m concerned she mainly stayed there because of her boyfriend. We feel she is really unhappy, but would never admit that to us. She has a few counselling sessions booked in, but how can I help her? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
