Roll up, roll up and lose yourself in a reverie of hipster vintage nostalgia! The delightfully enjoyable Circus 1903 professes to be a return to circus’s “golden [Victorian] age”, but is in fact a super-luxe reboot (with super-luxe ticket prices) for 21st-century tastes. The concept is simple: one by one, without a sniff of sweat or sawdust, daredevil acts from all corners of the globe – Mongolia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Russia, France – dressed in gorgeous Victoriana (ruffles, muslin, waistcoats) come on stage and do their jaw-dropping, gasp-inducing thing. All to a booming orchestral soundtrack heavy on the drum rolls. There is a whip-fast juggler, a mind-bending contortionist (the Elastic Dislocationist) and a succession of vertiginous tumbling and balancing acts, each introduced by US master of ceremonies Willy Whipsnade (David Williamson). Williamson builds a great rapport with the audience and, as the circus acts tick by, director Neil Dorward avoids repetition bedding in by peppering the programme with skits in which Williamson plucks children from the audience to help him with magic tricks. Williamson is great with the kids – gentle but acerbic – and these interludes are uproariously funny. The only moment of schmaltz is when a pair of lifesize elephant puppets (by Significant Object, the War Horse puppeteers) amble on stage – undeniably charming, but somewhat untethered from the whole. Everything builds to the “wheel of death” – a huge rotating arm with wheels at each end on which Colombia’s Magnificent Marvellos leap and run and twist. But the charm of this show is its analogue nature; the hi-tech finale is somehow less thrilling than the bravura simplicity of the first act: three acrobats sending each other soaring high off the ends of a wooden seesaw.
