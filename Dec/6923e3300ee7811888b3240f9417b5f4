Your description of Princess Anne in Pass notes (4 December) did not mention her role as patron of the Scottish Rugby Union, which she carries out to the full by turning up, fair weather and foul, singing Flower of Scotland at the international matches, even more boldly when it’s against England.

Most numismatists are aware of this.Tom EdenHeyshott, West Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
