Roy Loney, founding frontman of influential garage rock band the Flamin’ Groovies, has died aged 73. The band announced the news on Facebook, saying they were “deeply saddened and stunned”. His girlfriend told the San Francisco Chronicle that he died of organ failure at the city’s California Pacific Medical Center. “Roy was born on a Friday the 13th and he died on a Friday the 13th,” she said. “That is a very rockin’ thing to do.” The band formed in San Francisco in 1965, combining rock’n’roll, blues and R&B. Their strong sense of melody helped point the way to the power-pop sound of the 1970s and 80s, and they were revered in the punk scene of the late 70s. They didn’t have commercial success, but they were admired by their peers: according to the liner notes of a reissued version of the Flamin’ Groovies 1971 album Teenage Head, Mick Jagger thought of it as a better version of the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers; the Loney-penned song Headin’ for the Texas Border has been covered by Jack White’s band the Raconteurs. Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band was among those paying tribute to Loney, writing on Twitter: “He will live forever in the Underground Garage.” Loney left the band in 1971. He went on to record solo material while the Flamin’ Groovies continued with Chris Wilson as frontman, recording power-pop hits such as Shake Some Action. Loney reunited with the group after they released their 2017 album Fantastic Plastic, performing at live shows, including playing Teenage Head in full. He had been due to tour Europe with them earlier in 2019, but was injured in a fall and forced to cancel.
