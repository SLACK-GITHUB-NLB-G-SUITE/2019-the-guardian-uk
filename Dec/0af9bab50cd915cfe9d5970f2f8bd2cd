I have nothing against Clive James, but the claim that he “single-handedly turned TV criticism into an art form” (Digested week, 30 November) is not something that those of us who used to turn first in the morning to Nancy Banks-Smith’s column are likely to let past. Wit. Sharp but sympathetic criticism. Piece after piece wonderfully well-crafted. We still miss you, Nancy.Angus DoultonBere Ferrers, West Devon • It may be correct that Clive James had a “genius for expressing subtle thought in the language of men speaking to men” and that he “suspected other men’s ideologies” (Appreciation, 30 November). But it is likely that James himself recognised that women speak as well, and some of them even have ideologies.Prof Teresa McCormackQueen’s University Belfast • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
