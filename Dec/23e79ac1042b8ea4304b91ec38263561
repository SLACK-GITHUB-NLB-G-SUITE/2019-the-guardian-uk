As head of the BBC Drama plays department, James Cellan Jones set a distinctive tone. He encouraged new work and younger producers, myself included, in a rich period of single dramas and anthologies. After his return to his first love, directing, our collaborations included The Great Paper Chase (1988), the controversial comedy telling the story of Fleet Street, the Met and the arrest of the great train robber Ronnie Biggs in Brazil. Jim’s work was stylish, intelligent and original – like the man himself.
