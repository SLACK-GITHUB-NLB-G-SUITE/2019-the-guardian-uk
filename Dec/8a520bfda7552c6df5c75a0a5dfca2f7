Even in this era of guest spots and collaborations, it’s hard to think of another album that unites reggae singer Chronixx with Unknown Mortal Orchestra and the late Mac Miller. All crop up on this squelchy retro-funk outing by Free Nationals, otherwise known as Anderson .Paak’s backing band. There’s just the one guest spot from .Paak – a tune called Gidget, which references a fictional 1960s female surfer. And while this album’s rotating mic-spot keeps things moving like a playlist, the memorability of these tracks bobs up and down like the waves off the coast of Free Nationals’ native California. Beauty & Essex – featuring R&B singer Daniel Caesar and UMO – kicked off the album campaign a year ago with low-lit vibes and gynaecologically upfront intentions (”pussy wet like an ocean”), a vibe Free Nationals does little to shake. The breathy Kali Uchis combines with Mac Miller on Time, a tune so feather-light it barely registers. Much better is Shibuya featuring Syd, a delicate paean to having your loved one to yourself on Saturdays. Everything here goes down so smoothly, it works as a mood piece, but you long for a sweaty workout. The Chronixx track, Eternal Light, just supplies a more herbal haze.
