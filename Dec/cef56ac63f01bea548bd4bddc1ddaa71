The first trailer for Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the latest entry in the series of supernatural comedies inspired by the hit 1984 comedy Ghostbusters, has been released online. Directed by Jason Reitman – the son of Ivan Reitman, director of the first two films – Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the result of long-gestating plans for a third film to follow 1989’s Ghostbusters II. Starring Carrie Coon from The Leftovers, Mckenna Grace and Finn Wolfhard, the film follows a single mother and her two children as they move to Oklahoma after they inherit a mysterious property. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver – stars of the original film – are due to make cameo appearances; Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spengler, died in 2014. The 2016 reboot, featuring an all-female main cast, was a sizeable hit, taking over $220m worldwide, but was notable for the racist and misogynist attacks on one of its stars, Leslie Jones. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is due for release on 10 July in the US and UK.
