The Chilean military has deployed fighter jets in an expansion of its search for an air force cargo plane that crashed with 38 people aboard over a remote stretch of frigid sea between South America and Antarctica. The Hercules C-130 cargo plane disappeared shortly after taking off late on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas. The air force concluded the aircraft must have crashed early the next morning, given the number of hours it had been missing. The cause of the crash was not known and officials acknowledged the chances of finding survivors were slim. Large rolling waves in the icy Drake Passage and low clouds had complicated the search on Tuesday, authorities said. Air force general Eduardo Mosqueira said the search area now covers an area of about 250 by 280 mile (400 by 450km). He told reporters that improved visibility was helping the crews of searchers using planes, satellites and vessels from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and the US as well as Chile. The flight appeared routine until the moment it disappeared, Mosqueira said. The region where the plane disappeared is a vast, largely untouched ocean wilderness of penguin-inhabited ice sheets off the edge of the South American continent with depths of 11,500ft (3,500 meters). The military was using sonar-enabled navy ships to detect irregularities at depth, and that it had established quadrangles to help organize the search, Mosqueira said. Ships from Argentina and Brazil were assisting, he said.
