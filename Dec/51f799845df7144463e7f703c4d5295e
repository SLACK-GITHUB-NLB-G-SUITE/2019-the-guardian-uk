Liverpool Women have hit back at criticism from the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, over the state of their pitch. Speaking after her side’s 1-1 draw on Sunday at Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women play their games, Hayes branded the pitch the worst in the WSL. Both teams struggled in the conditions at Tranmere’s ground after heavy rain before the match and during play. “This pitch shouldn’t be part of our league,” Hayes said. “Our league deserves better standards and I think Liverpool – champions of Europe – should provide their women’s team with significantly more than they’re doing. “I think the quality of that pitch – the worst in the league – is a stain on their club.” Hayes then apologised on Monday via Twitter, adding Liverpool “deserved the point against us”. However Liverpool sent out their own statement, which read: “In Prenton Park, Liverpool Women have the use of a League One facility, further up the football pyramid than many other clubs in WSL. “Despite dreadful weather conditions in the run-up to Sunday’s game – and heavy rain during play – the ground staff ensured a playable pitch and a highly competitive game was the result. “We wish Emma Hayes and her Chelsea team all the very best for the rest of the season.”
