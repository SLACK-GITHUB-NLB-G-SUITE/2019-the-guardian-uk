Both Lingfield and Southwell came through precautionary inspections at 8am on Tuesday morning with no problems, which means that there is a complete jumps programme for the first time in almost a week, but the twilight Flat meeting at Wolverhampton may hold the best bet of the day as Keswick (5.15) has plenty to recommend him in a race that will not take a great deal of winning. Heather Main’s five-year-old registered his most recent win over this course and distance in October last year, finishing nearly three lengths clear off a mark of 76. He is 1lb lower and showed definite signs of a return to form last time out, when he finished a close fifth at Chelmsford. The time of that race was solid and he looks a very fair price at around 9-2 to beat five opponents. Diodorus (6.45) is also worth a close look at around 7-1 in the stayers’ handicap later on the card. It is safe to say that Karen McLintock’s gelding will never live up to his pedigree – he is by Galileo out of the dual French Classic winner Divine Proportions – but his most recent outings have suggested that there is a race in him somewhere and the most obvious threat in the field – Rajinsky – is taking a significant step up in trip. Tis Fantastic (3.05) looks like the best bet on the Southwell card after a career-best run on his handicap debut last time, while at Lingfield The Manuscript (1.45) can continue Jonjo O’Neill’s good run of form in the three-mile handicap chase.
