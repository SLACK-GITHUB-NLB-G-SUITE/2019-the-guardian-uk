Hiccup Theatre’s family shows always take you to unexpected places in such imaginative ways. It’s this element of surprise that makes their productions so much fun – and not just for the kids. This year, Hiccup and co-producer Derby theatre are taking us into the deepest, darkest depths of the Big Bad Wolf’s belly, where Grandma lies after being swallowed whole. But this madcap show is such a winner that, as the end approaches, I can’t help hoping Grandma stays down there a little longer. The same creative team behind last year’s Goldilocks and the Three Bears have reunited, and they bounce off each other with ease and skill. Sarah Brigham’s script is full of clever twists (is that Little Red Riding Hood climbing inside the Wolf’s mouth?) and witty dialogue, with some particularly great gags for Bethan Morgan’s channel-swimming, circus-joining Grandma. Ivan Stott’s songs have a glowing energy to them, his lyrics are as sharp as ever, and dramaturg Sarah Argent makes sure the storytelling is crystal clear. There’s a slapdash charm to the small ensemble of actors, who function as storytellers, puppeteers, musicians, comics and anything else you might fancy. Half the time they look as though they’re making things up on the spot – and just happen to be very, very good. Sam Wilde’s set initially looks a bit cobbled together but, like Red Riding Hood herself, is much cleverer than first appears. There are countless visuals to savour but the image that will stay with me is a puppet-sized Grandma trapped in the Wolf’s stomach (a wardrobe swung wide open), swinging from some tonsils fashioned out of a red bra. At Derby theatre until 4 January.
