Donald Trump began a campaign rally in Michigan on Wednesday evening right as members of Congress moved to vote to make him the third US president in history to be impeached. Trump in Michigan shrugged off the vote in Washington. “It doesn’t really feel like we’re being impeached,” the president said before a roaring crowd in Battle Creek. “The country is doing better than ever before. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. And we have tremendous support in the Republican party, like we’ve never had before”, he continued. As Trump spoke, US lawmakers in the House of Representatives were concluding more than eight hours of debate on two articles of impeachment against the president, providing a stark example of the country’s divide. Thousands had gathered at the Kellogg Arena to watch the president speak and the mood among many attendants was almost celebratory. One man chanted “Four more years!” to cheers as he stood on a wall waving a large Make America Great Again flag. Before Trump came on stage, the vice-president, Mike Pence, had told the crowds Democrats were trying to impeach Trump because they can’t beat him in 2020. “They’re trying to run down this president because they can’t run against our record. They know they can’t stop you from giving President Donald Trump four more years in the White House.” More details soon.
