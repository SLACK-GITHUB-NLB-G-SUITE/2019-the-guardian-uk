Liverpool have been drawn against Everton at Anfield in the FA Cup third round, a repeat of the match played at the same stage in the 2017-18 season. Jürgen Klopp’s side were the victors on that occasion, 2-1 courtesy of an 84th-minute Virgil van Dijk goal on his debut for the club, while Everton won a fourth-round replay 1-0 in 2009 after a 1-1 draw at Anfield. Michael Owen, who scored Liverpool’s two goals in the 2001 FA Cup final win over Arsenal, tweeted: “No question what the tie of the round is in.” Manchester City, the holders, are at home to Port Vale, while Manchester United travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers, who knocked them out in the sixth round last season. John Rudge, a former Vale manager and now the club’s president, said: “What a challenge. It’s fantastic for the players and the crowd to come to Manchester City and play in the third round of the FA Cup. We might have to park the bus a few times. It will help the new owners, who have done well. We will all be looking forward to it.” Leeds are at Arsenal, who have won the cup a record 13 times, in a repeat of the 1972 final won by Leeds. The last two meetings between the clubs were also in the third round. In 2012 Arsenal won 1-0 and they also eliminated Leeds 3-1 in a replay after a 1-1 draw the previous year. AFC Fylde of the National League are at Sheffield United of the Premier League, while Chelsea will face the Championship’s Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge.
