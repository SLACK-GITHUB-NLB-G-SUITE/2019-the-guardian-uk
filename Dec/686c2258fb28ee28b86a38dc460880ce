Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My brother and his partner (in their early 30s) live in a one-bed flat and never host the family Christmas – they always come to us. We’ve never asked for cash before, but it’s quite a burden, given they eat and drink a lot, and stay for a week or more. How do other people handle this situation? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
