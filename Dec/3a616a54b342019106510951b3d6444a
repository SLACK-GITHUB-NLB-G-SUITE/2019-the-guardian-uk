Alan Partridge’s Nomad is perfect. Either that or Reach for the Ground, Jeffrey Bernard’s collected articles about pissing his life away. The title alone is worth buying the book for. My nan was unintentionally hilarious. I was watching a nature documentary about crocodiles with her once and she said they looked so evil she wished she’d never been born. In Edinburgh one year a woman in the front row told me she’d seen me the previous year so decided to come back. “You enjoyed it last year then?” I said. “No,” she replied, “I just came back to check you were OK.” I once tried to do a runner from a curry house when I was a student. Unfortunately, I was so drunk I went the wrong way and ran straight into the kitchen. I tried to grow my hair when I was a teenager but it just went streaky with bald patches and my mum said I looked like a “greasy heroin addict”. So I cut it. I once had a dream where I started wearing a gold pendant in the shape of boxing gloves. I thought it was really cool but people in the dream kept laughing at me and saying it was embarrassing. Utter scum. Alistair Green is being funny throughout the festive period on Twitter and Instagram @mralistairgreen
