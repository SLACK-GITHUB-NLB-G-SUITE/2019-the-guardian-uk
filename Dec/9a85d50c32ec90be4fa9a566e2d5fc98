The chances of a British and Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup appear to have improved, according to the general manager of the Football Association of Ireland. After a presentation at the Euro 2020 draw in Bucharest, Noel Mooney was quoted by the Times as saying: “The feasibility study is positive and there’s a sense the right thing to do is go forward. This bid is out on the front foot and very well led by the English FA, who gave a very strong presentation. It’s a chance to get a really credible bid and hopefully win it. I’d be very surprised if there’s not a very credible bid from Great Britain and Ireland.” In August last year a joint home nations bid for the 2030 World Cup was given full backing by Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, who said it was “about time” the tournament returned to England for the first time since 1966. Such a full and public endorsement of a possible bid by Ceferin, the most powerful man in international football in Europe, was a huge boost. “I think it would be a very wise idea,” he said last year. “The infrastructure in the UK is very good and in a way if more countries bid there is more chance to win. I think after all these years it’s time for that part of Europe to get the World Cup. I don’t doubt the quality of the bid.” Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup and Canada, the United States and Mexico are joint-hosts for 2026, which will be a 48-team tournament.
