Scottish Ballet’s The Snow Queen, created by artistic director Christopher Hampson and designer Lez Brotherston to celebrate the company’s 50th anniversary, has plenty of surface sparkle but lacks some adventurous spirit. By way of explaining the titular character’s frosty evildoing, Hampson and Brotherston have chopped and changed Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale to include a spat between the Snow Queen (Constance Devernay) and her bored sister, the Summer Princess (Kayla-Maree Tarantolo). Hoping to find true love, the latter pops on a cardie and heads to the human world disguised as a pickpocket, where she encounters childhood sweethearts Gerda (Bethany Kingsley-Garner) and Kai (Andrew Peasgood). Many magical ice-shards later, Gerda gets her bloke back, while the reunited sisters dispatch themselves into a convenient sinkhole upstage. Plot holes aside, Brotherston’s punchily graphic designs and a supple Rimsky-Korsakov score (newly orchestrated by Richard Honner) ensure the production looks and sounds great. The memorable marketplace scene in the first act abounds in lovely detail – framed by sooty industrial brickwork and railway arches, we see busy chestnut vendors and tweedy townsfolk interrupted by a mildly sinister travelling circus troupe that includes pratfalling Pierrots, scantily-clad ribbon-wafters and a brilliantined strongman in tasselled leopard-print pants. For all the visual and musical nuance, the action on stage remains courteously constrained, never leaping into imaginative life. Still, there’s winsome choreography for the principal characters. Peasgood displays clean lines and attractive knitwear as Kai, while Kingsley-Garner’s sparky demeanour and softly melting bourrées contrast well with the Snow Queen’s spiked angularity and snappy pointe work. Despite a plethora of wolves and jumping Jack Frosts, the ice kingdom denouement lacks much-needed bite – more slush than sharp.
