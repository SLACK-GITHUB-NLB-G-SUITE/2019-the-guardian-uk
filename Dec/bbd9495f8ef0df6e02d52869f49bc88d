The remains of six people have been found after a helicopter overflying a mountainous area of Hawaii crashed at the top of a mountain on the island of Kauai, authorities said. There were no indications of survivors, officials said, and a search for the last person yet to be recovered would resume in the morning depending on weather. Those who were recovered had not been identified and their families were being notified. A search began for the helicopter carrying a pilot and six passengers from two families after it was reported overdue on Thursday evening from a tour of Kauaiâ€™s Na Pali coast. Two passengers were believed to be minors, the coast guard said. Steep terrain, low visibility, choppy seas and rain complicated the search. The helicopter company, identified as Safari Helicopters, contacted the coast guard about 45 minutes after the aircraft was due back, a coast guard statement said. The Eurocopter AS350 helicopter took off from the town of Lihue, the Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said. The helicopter was found in a mountainous region inland from the Na Pali Coast, which is one of the most dramatic and sought-after destinations in Hawaii and was featured in the film Jurassic Park. Towering mountains with deep ravines and huge waterfalls make up the interior of the uninhabited state park. Red rock cliffs with thick jungle canopies rise from the Pacific Ocean to over 4,000ft (1,219 meters) high.
