A highly sensitive person (HSP) is defined as someone who has an acute reaction to physical and emotional stimuli. Dr Elaine Aron, author of the book The Highly Sensitive Person, first coined the phrase to describe people with high measures of sensory processing sensitivity and comprised a test to help you deduct if you are one. According to the psychologist, high sensitivity can be found in 15-20% of the population. A highly sensitive person – who can be introverted or extroverted – processes information deeply which means they can often become overwhelmed by crowds, loud noises and other people’s moods. They also tend to have rich inner lives, are profoundly moved by music and the arts, and often feel the need to withdraw into a quiet corner on busy days. As a child, they were described as shy and sensitive by their parents and teachers. We are interested in hearing in detail from people who view themselves as a highly sensitive person. In what ways does it affect your life? When did you first realise you were a HSP? In what situations do you find yourself overwhelmed? What are the best and worst things about being a HSP?
