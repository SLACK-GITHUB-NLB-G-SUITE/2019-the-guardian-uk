I am aware of the dilemma many readers face when it comes to voting. One particular issue that I would ask them to consider, which has received very little scrutiny during the election campaign, is the protection of parliamentary democracy. Hidden away on page 48 of the Conservative manifesto is this: “After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts”. Boris Johnson didn’t like it when MPs stood up to him in parliament and prevented him from carrying out what he wanted, and he was similarly antipathetic towards the judges who declared that his proroguing of parliament was not legal. I fear that if Mr Johnson wins, he will take steps to curtail the powers of MPs and judges so that similar situations cannot occur in the future. It is clear that the British people greatly value their democracy. I urge anyone who is yet undecided how to vote on Thursday to vote for any party other than the Conservatives to ensure that our parliamentary democracy is safeguarded.Heather LeybournLowestoft, Suffolk • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
