Colin Tizzard may send Native River in a surprise move to join stablemate Lostintranslation in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. “I hope it rains every day between now and Kempton, then I might run Native River as well,” Tizzard revealed during a media event at his stables on Tuesday morning. “It might be that they go flat out in the King George and that is why we are keeping the door half open. If the ground came up soft or even heavy, then he could be supplemented.” Native River, who was third in the King George last year, returned this season with victory at Aintree last weekend and would have to be supplemented for Kempton. He has been introduced at 16-1 for the King George by the sponsors Ladbrokes. Lostintranslation is joint-favourite with Cyrname for the Kempton highlight after his defeat of Bristol De Mai in the Betfair Chase at Haydock last month, and his trainer enthused about his chances on Tuesday. “Lostintranslation has come out of Haydock beautifully. He is a big, strong horse in the peak of his powers at the moment and I couldn’t be happier with him,” said Tizzard. “There is no doubt he has got the pace for Kempton and he showed at Haydock he has got more stamina than Bristol De Mai, which is another feather in his cap. ”He is a beautiful horse, but it is going to be a really tough race. Cyrname looks fantastic, Altior is a fantastic horse, Clan Des Obeaux won it last year and I don’t know what the Irish are going to send over.” Lingfield 12.10 Gawdawpalin 12.40 My Target 1.10 Islay Mist 1.40 Kwela (nb) 2.10 Dubious Affair 2.40 Elena 3.10 Pearl Spectre Hexham 12.20 Champagne Chaser 12.50 Smuggler's Stash 1.20 Miah Grace 1.50 Casimir Du Clos 2.20 Pleney 2.50 Lastin Memories (nap) 3.20 Calle Malva Leicester 1.00 Flash De Clerval 1.30 Flight To Milan 2.00 Pistol Whipped 2.30 Chambard 3.00 Kepagge 3.30 Little Rory Mac Chelmsford City 3.25 Sweet Serenade 3.55 Martin's Brig 4.25 True Believer 4.55 Agent Of Fortune 5.25 Loulin 5.55 Que Quieres Kempton 3.40 Ivatheengine 4.10 Ruby Power 4.40 Eastern World 5.10 Sheriffmuir 5.40 Earth And Sky 6.10 Glendevon 6.40 Rainbow Dreamer 7.10 Garth Rockett Tizzard has also not yet ruled out running Thistlecrack in the race for the fourth time though is presently in favour of running last year’s King George runner-up in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on 21 December. Tizzard said: “Thistlecrack has come out of the race at Newbury fine. The question for ourselves is, is the staying hurdle division easier than the King George/Gold Cup division? Yes it is. There is a very good chance he will stay over hurdles. If one or two in the King George dropped out that might change, but at the moment I would say we are leaning towards the hurdles route. “It was a lovely run at Newbury. He is 11 going on 12, so we have got to mind him because he has been delicate. He might only want three runs this year and if we don’t think he is right [for Ascot] we might wait until the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham at the end of January.” Tony Paley Fontwell 12.30 Two Sams 1.00 Christmas In April 1.30 Gelboe De Chanay 2.00 Quarenta (nb) 2.30 Mystic Dreamer 3.00 Gold Mountain 3.30 Lochinver Uttoxeter 12.40 Poucor 1.10 Vereina 1.40 Bullionaire 2.10 With Discretion 2.40 Passam 3.10 Freddie Darling Wolverhampton 3.45 Goddess Of Fire 4.15 Millicent Fawcett 4.45 Augustus Caesar 5.15 Diamonique (nap) 5.45 Disruptor 6.15 Boy In The Bar 6.45 Grey Mist 7.15 Sir Hector
