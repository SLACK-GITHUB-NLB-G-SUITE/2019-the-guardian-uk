Juventus are set to sign the 19-year-old midfielder Dejan Kulusevski after agreeing a deal worth €35m (£29.8m) plus a potential €10m in add-ons with the player’s club, Atalanta. The Swede is playing for Parma on loan this season and has been one of the biggest success story of the current Serie A campaign. He has four goals in 16 appearances and has impressed with his overall game and decision-making. Juventus have offered Kulusevski a contract until 2024 worth €4m a season, which he has agreed in principle, and the Serie A champions are now considering whether to try to end his loan deal with Parma early or whether to wait until the summer. Kulusevski joined Atalanta in 2016 from Swedish side Brommapojkarna and made three substitute appearances for the club during the 2018-19 season. Brommapojkarna will receive a percentage of the fee. Kulusevski’s mother is Macedonian and he played for North Macedonia’s Under-17 team but made his Sweden debut in November 2019, coming on as a substitute against Faroe Islands. “I like to have the ball at my feet,” he said in an interview with Sportbladet this year. “I used to dribble a lot when I was a kid but I have got better at moving the ball more quickly. I have developed my defensive game, that was a weakness before, and that has made me a more complete player.”
