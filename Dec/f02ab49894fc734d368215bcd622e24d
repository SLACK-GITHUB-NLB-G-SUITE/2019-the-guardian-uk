Openers Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt hit one-day international hundreds as England made a winning start against Pakistan in Malaysia. The pair shared a first-wicket stand of 188 to set up a 75-run victory at Kuala Lumpur’s Kinrara Oval in the opening game of an ICC Women’s Championship series featuring three ODIs and three Twenty20s. Beaumont struck nine fours in her 107 from 141 balls before becoming one of Rameen Shamim’s three victims. Wyatt was the more aggressive of the pair, striking 12 fours and three sixes in a majestic 95-ball 110 to claim the player of the match award. The captain, Heather Knight, chipped in with 41 from 44 balls as England, determined to bounce back from last summer’s Ashes series defeat to Australia, posted 284 for six from 50 overs. Pakistan slumped to five for two as Anya Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt removed openers Nahida Khan and Sidra Ameen inside the opening three overs. The captain, Bismah Maroof, offered resistance with 69 from 94 balls but Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals and were always behind the required run rate. Kate Cross took the crucial wickets of Bismah and Aliya Riaz (39) and finished with four for 32 from seven overs. Rain briefly interrupted play, but the players were able to return to the field and Pakistan were eventually dismissed for 209 from 44.4 overs. Seamer Brunt (2-31) and leg-spinner Sarah Glenn (2-38) offered excellent support to Cross.
