George Monbiot’s article (This week, of all weeks, let’s try to hold back the tide of lies, Journal, 11 December) criticises the Independent Press Standards Organisation’s complaints process. First, I am sorry and do apologise for the fact that resolution of the complaint took longer to investigate than should have been the case. But the complainant was in touch with us regularly and expressed gratitude when told of the result – possibly a mere courtesy or possibly that, speaking as she did regularly to Ipso, she appreciated how seriously and conscientiously we were trying to deal with it. However obvious the outcome may seem to those who are successful, we have to listen to and evaluate the arguments on both sides even if the respondent is a newspaper. A staff shortage, in the summer, which compounded the delay has now been cured. We strive for speed, but speed is not the only criterion for justice, and the delay, which ought not to have happened, tells one nothing about the care and commitment of everyone at Ipso, in the course of dealing with over 47,000 complaints, in its efforts to protect members of the public from breaches of the editors’ code.Sir Alan MosesChairman of Ipso • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
