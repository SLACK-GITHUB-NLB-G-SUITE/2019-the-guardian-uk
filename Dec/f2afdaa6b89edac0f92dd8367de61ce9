Everton have confirmed the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as their newmanager on a four-and-a-half-year contract. Ancelotti was at Goodison Park watching Saturday’s draw against Arsenal from the stands before formally taking up his position on Monday. He arrives in place of Marco Silva, who was sacked earlier this month, and his arrival will be regarded as a significant coup for the club and its majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri. “This is a great club with a rich history and a very passionate fan base,” Ancelotti told Everton’s club website. “There is a clear vision from the owner and the board to deliver success and trophies. That is something that appeals to me as a manager and I am thrilled at the prospect of being able to work with everybody at the club to help make that vision a reality.” Ancelotti, whose first match in charge will be the home meeting with Burnley on Boxing Day, will take over from interim manager Duncan Ferguson. The former Toffees striker oversaw impressive performances against Chelsea, Manchester United and Leicester, plus the less impressive one against Arsenal, and Ancelotti confirmed he will be part of his staff. It is thought his son, Davide, will assist him. “I have seen from the performances in the last two weeks that the players are capable of so much. The work Duncan has done is a great credit to him,” he said. “Strong organisation, strong discipline and the right motivation are some of the key ingredients in football and I’m pleased that he will be part of my backroom team moving forward.” 🔵 | Introducing the new manager of Everton Football Club, @MrAncelotti! #WelcomeMrAncelotti pic.twitter.com/zNNoix8H5R Only three weeks have passed since Ancelotti was sacked by Napoli – despite qualifying them for the last 16 of the Champions League - and hisquick return to top-level football is the latest move in the 60-year-old’slong and successful career.
