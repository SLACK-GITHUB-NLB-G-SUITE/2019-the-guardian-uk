Earlier today I set the following two puzzles about number sandwiches. 1) A number sandwich is a line of digits such that there is one digit sandwiched between the 1s, two digits sandwiched between the 2’s, three digits sandwiched between the 3’s, and so on. For example, 312132 is a number sandwich with the digits 1,2 and 3 Construct a number sandwich with the digits 1,2,3 and 4. (Each digit will appear exactly twice.) Solution: 4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2 (or the same order backwards) 2) A number club sandwich is a number sandwich in which each digit appears exactly three times. The same rules as above apply: one digit is sandwiched between any two consecutive 1s, two digits are sandwiched between any two consecutive 2s, and so on. Construct a number club sandwich with the digits 1 to 9. To help you out, I’ve placed five digits in their correct positions. Solution: 3 4 7 9 3 6 4 8 3 5 7 4 6 9 2 5 8 2 7 6 2 5 1 9 1 8 1 Here’s how we get there. Look at the 4 that is placed as a starter. There are two other 4s in the line. Either one 4 is to the left of the initial 4 and one is to the right, or both are to the right. (There is not enough space for both of the other 4s to be on the left.) We can deduce that there must be a 4 that is four digits along to the right. Likewise, there must be a 5 five digits to the left of the given 5. _ _ _ _ _ _ 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 _ _ _ 5 _ 2 _ _ _ _ 1 _ _ _ _ We can’t place both missing 2s to the left of the given 2, so one must be to the right. This blocks off any 1s being to the left of the given 1, which means both missing 1s must be to the right. _ _ _ _ _ _ 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 _ _ _ 5 _ 2 _ _ 2 _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 Now let’s see where the 9s can go. If the 9 is in position 1, there is a 9 in positions 11 and 21. However, position 21 is already taken by a 2, so 9 cannot be in position 1. If the 9 is in position 2, there is a 9 in positions 12 and 22. However, position 12 is taken by a 4, so a 9 cannot be in position 2. When we run through all the possibilities, we deduce that the only position that works is a 9 in positions 4, 14 and 24. _ _ _ 9 _ _ 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 _ 9 _ 5 _ 2 _ _ 2 _ 1 9 1 _ 1 Which forces the positions of the final 2 and 5: _ _ _ 9 _ _ 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 _ 9 2 5 _ 2 _ _ 2 5 1 9 1 _ 1 The 6s have only one position to go: _ _ _ 9 _ 6 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 6 9 2 5 _ 2 _ 6 2 5 1 9 1 _ 1 Which fixes the 3s: 3 _ _ 9 3 6 4 _ 3 5 _ 4 6 9 2 5 _ 2 _ 6 2 5 1 9 1_ 1 The penultimate space is either a 7 or an 8. It has to be an 8, so we get: 3 _ _ 9 3 6 4 8 3 5 _ 4 6 9 2 5 8 2 _ 6 2 5 1 9 1 8 1 And to finish 3 4 7 9 3 6 4 8 3 5 7 4 6 9 2 5 8 2 7 6 2 5 1 9 1 8 1 Ta-dah! I hope you enjoyed todays puzzles and I’ll be back in two weeks. Still peckish for more puzzles? To satisfy your appetite, why not savour So You Think You’ve Got Problems? My latest book is a compendium of 200 or so puzzles together with historical and mathematical background. The puzzles span wordplay, logic, geometry, linguistics, topology and many other fields. It’s for all abilities: there are very simple teasers that children will be able to do and utterly baffling ones for only the sharpest minds I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.
