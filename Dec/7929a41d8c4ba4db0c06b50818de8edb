New research by the Bank of England has shown that its efforts a decade ago to prevent a 1930s-style depression had the spin-off effect of boosting Britain’s birth rate. The Bank’s study found that the emergency slashing of interest rates in the winter of 2008-09 cut the household bills for families on floating rate mortgages and made having children more affordable. Fertility rates normally fall during recessions, but despite suffering its worst post-second world war slump in 2008 and 2009, the UK bucked the trend as a result of borrowing costs being cut to the lowest level in the Bank’s history. A study by economists Fergus Cumming and Lisa Dettling showed that cutting interest rates from 5% in the summer of 2008 to 0.5% by March 2009 led to 14,500 additional babies being born in 2009 and increased birth rates by 7.5% over the next three years. Cumming and Dettling found that each percentage point drop in the Bank of England’s official interest rate increased birth rates by 2%, with those households on adjustable rates having their average quarterly mortgage payments drop by £1,000 – or 42% – thus reducing the cost of child-rearing. The Bank’s paper said in the absence of the aggressive cuts in interest rates, falling employment and lower house prices would have led to the customary fall in the birth rate during tough economic times. “In other words, the fertility stimulus effects of UK monetary policy were sufficiently large to outweigh the headwinds of the recession.” Britain’s rising birth rate contrasted with a “baby bust” in the US – a differing trend that the two economists suggest is the result of American homebuyers being more likely to be on fixed-rate mortgage contracts. “In both countries, birth rates begin to fall almost as soon as the unemployment rate begins to rise, but in the UK that trend is reversed once the policy rate (bank rate) begins to drop. In the US, the downward trend continues through the recession.”
