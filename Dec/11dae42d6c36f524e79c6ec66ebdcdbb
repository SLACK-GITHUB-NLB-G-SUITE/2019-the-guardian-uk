I can add a curious postscript to Robert Egerton’s involvement with the Hotel de Paris at Bray (How a posh hotel nearly ruined Wallis Simpson’s divorce plans, 23 December). I used to know his first wife, Sheila, and she told me that when they married, he took her to that hotel for the first night of their honeymoon. Arriving in the suite, she asked him where she might find the bathroom. He pointed at once to a particular door – and she was horrified. She thought he had been there before with another lady. He explained that when dealing with the Simpson divorce case, he had been so taken by the hotel that he decided that when he married he would take his bride there. She was much relieved.Hugo VickersLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
