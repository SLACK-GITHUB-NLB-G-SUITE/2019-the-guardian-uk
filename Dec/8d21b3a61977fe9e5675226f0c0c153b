It amazes me when mist chloroforms the fields and wipes out whatever world  exists and walkers wade through coma                               shouting and close to but curtained from each other sometimes there’s a second river lying asleep along the river where the sun rises                sunk in thought and my soul gets caught in it                hung by the heels                in water it amazes me when mist                              weeps as it lifts and a crow calls down to me in its treetop voice        that there are webs and drips and actualities up there and in my fog-self shocked and grey                it startles me to see the sky  • Alice Oswald was this year elected as the first female professor of poetry at the University of Oxford
