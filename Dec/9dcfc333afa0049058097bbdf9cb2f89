Natalie Sciver scored a series-clinching unbeaten century as England women made it back-to-back wins over Pakistan with victory by 127 runs in the second ODI in Kuala Lumpur. Sciver made 100 off 85 balls while captain Heather Knight made 86 off 100 and Fran Wilson clubbed three sixes as she contributed 85 off just 49 balls, helping England set an imposing target of 328. Pakistan never truly looked like troubling it as they slipped behind the required run rate early on, and the contest was over after they slipped from 140 for three to 145 for six. The wickets were shared around, with two apiece for Anya Shrubsole, Sarah Glenn, Sophie Ecclestone and Knight – who was named player of the match. “I was really happy to reach three figures, from a selfish point of view, but it was just nice to take the team to a big total,” Sciver said. “Fran batted so well when she came in and she really helped us accelerate towards 300 and beyond - it was a lot of fun batting with her and she played excellently. “It was a shame Heather didn’t get to her landmark because she batted so well and it would have been a lovely way for her to celebrate getting to 100 caps. “Pakistan have been quite testing, they were hard to get away at points today and they were solid with the bat so we’re happy to have gone 2-0 up and won the series.” There is one match still to play in the series on Saturday.
