I once had the good fortune to work with David Bellamy . I was directing a BBC children’s multifaith programme called Umbrella and we decided to do a programme on death – not the easiest topic for children. David agreed to take part and suggested we film the piece in Hamsterley Forest, near his home in County Durham. When we played the edited tape into the studio recording, the children taking part were enraptured as he linked the life cycle of the trees with that of human beings. He ended the piece by saying: “I have always wished I could fly. When I die I hope that someone will scatter my ashes in this forest. Then perhaps one day an ant will pick up a little piece of that ash. Then maybe a bird will pick up the ant and fly up into the sky with it. Then at last David Bellamy will be able to fly.”
