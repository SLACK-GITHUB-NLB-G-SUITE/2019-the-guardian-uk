All-rounder Sam Curran was the most expensive England player in the Indian Premier League auction on Thursday as he was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for £590,000. Curran was a success for Kings XI Punjab in last year’s tournament, but has been poached by Chennai for the 2020 version. England captain Eoin Morgan is back in the league after missing last year as Kolkata Knight Riders shelled out £560,000 for his services. Chris Woakes was sold to the Delhi Capitals for £160,000, the same price that they paid for opener Jason Roy. Australia bowler Pat Cummins became the most expensive non-Indian player in the auction when he was sold to the Knight Riders for a massive £1.6m. His Australia teammate Glenn Maxwell, recently revealed to be suffering with his mental health, also broke the million-pound barrier, heading to Kings XI Punjab for £1.1m.
