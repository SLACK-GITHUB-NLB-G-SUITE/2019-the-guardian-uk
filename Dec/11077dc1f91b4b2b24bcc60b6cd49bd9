Robin Copeland’s last-gasp try rescued a 27-24 win from the jaws of defeat as Connacht pipped Gloucester in a dramatic Champions Cup clash in Galway. Despite missing some key men, including Danny Cipriani who was pulled from the bench with a bug, Gloucester were on course to complete a Pool Five double over the Irish province thanks to tries from Gerbrandt Grobler, Mark Atkinson (two) and the captain, Lewis Ludlow. Connacht’s 10-7 half-time lead was turned into a 24-13 deficit as they stared at a European exit but, with the flanker Ludlow in the sin-bin, they delighted the home crowd with converted tries from Shane Delahunt and Copeland during a frantic final six minutes. The result keeps both sides’ quarter-final hopes alive, although defeating both Toulouse and Montpellier next month is a big ask. Failing to pick up a bonus point across the first four rounds, Connacht sit third in the table on eight points, with Gloucester second thanks to last week’s home win and their haul of five bonuses. Gloucester head coach Johan Ackermann bemoaned the panic that set into their defence late on. “First of all, I’m proud of the players and the effort they put in there,” said the South African. “Credit must go to Connacht for scoring the two tries when they needed them – especially the last one I felt was quite special, the way they held onto the ball. “We probably panicked a bit. If you look at how good our defence was for the whole game and then suddenly we were tight in our defence. We missed a few tackles and they got the try they needed.” In Pool Two Glasgow Warriors are all but out after a dreadfully wasteful 12-7 defeat to the bottom side La Rochelle. The hosts thought they had sensationally won in the last minute but Adam Hastings’ try was chalked off and Matt Fagerson sent off for leading with his forearm straight into the throat of a defender. Also in Pool Five Toulouse beat Montpellier 26-18. In Pool 1 Benetton beat Lyon 25-22.
