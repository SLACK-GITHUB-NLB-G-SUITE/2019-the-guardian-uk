The sporting year’s traditional raucous curtain-raiser, the PDC world darts final, takes place on New Year’s Day. The BDO championship follows, with men’s and women’s titles on offer at the O2, and the second of snooker’s “triple crown” events, the Masters, takes place at Wembley. Speaking of which, the Carabao Cup final will be set as the two-legged semi-finals are completed, and the FA Cup field will be cut down to 16. The tennis year kicks off with a new event, the 24-team international ATP Cup, being held in Sydney, Perth and Brisbane, before the year’s first grand slam, the Australian Open. It’s a big month for cricket: England’s tour of South Africa continues, India welcome Sri Lanka and Australia, and the women’s T20 tri-series between India, Australia and England begins. The road to the Super Bowl will take shape, and college football’s national champions will be decided in New Orleans. 1 Jan PDC world darts championship final (London)2-6 Australia v NZ third Test (Sydney)3-7 South Africa v England second Test (Cape Town)3-12 ATP Cup (Australia)3-6 FA Cup third round4-5 NFL playoffs: wildcard round4-12 BDO world darts championship5-10 India v Sri Lanka T20 series7-8 Carabao Cup semi-final first legs7-20 West Indies v Ireland ODI/T20 series11-12 NFL divisional playoffs12-19 Masters snooker (Alexandra Palace)13 College football national championship (New Orleans)14-19 India v Australia ODI series16-20 South Africa v England third Test (Port Elizabeth) 17-19 Scottish Cup fourth round19 NFL conference championships20-2 Feb Australian Open tennis (Melbourne)23-26 WRC Monte Carlo Rally (Monaco)24-27 FA Cup fourth round24-28 South Africa v England fourth Test (Johannesburg)24-2 Feb New Zealand v India T20 series25-26 NHL All-Star game (St Louis)26 NFL Pro Bowl (Orlando)28-29 Carabao Cup semi-final second legs30 Super League season begins31 Women's T20 tri-series begins (Australia) The month begins with the Six Nations, as rugby union’s northern giants rebuild after an ultimately unsuccessful World Cup. Wales are the holders, but must travel to Dublin and Twickenham. Beaten finalists in Japan, England also host Ireland and will fancy their chances if they can return from Paris with a win on the opening weekend. Eddie Jones’ side are favourites but France may be a decent outside bet, with Cardiff and Murrayfield their only away trips. In the women’s tournament, England will be favourites to retain their title after their recent away Test victory over their nearest rivals, France. Sarah Hunter’s side open their campaign with a trip to Pau, and end it in Padova against last year’s runners-up, Italy. 1 Feb Wales v Italy (2.15pm)1 Feb Ireland v Scotland (4.45pm)2 Feb France v England (3pm) 8 Feb Ireland v Wales (2.15pm)8 Feb Scotland v England (4.45pm)9 Feb France v Italy (3pm) 22 Feb Italy v Scotland (2.15pm)22 Feb Wales v France (4.45pm)23 Feb England v Ireland (3pm) 7 Mar Ireland v Italy (2.15pm)7 Mar England v Wales (4.45pm)8 Mar Scotland v France (3pm) 14 Mar Wales v Scotland (2.15pm)14 Mar Italy v England (4.45pm)14 Mar France v Ireland (8pm) • All times GMT; all matches on BBC or ITV February’s first weekend also sees perhaps the biggest sporting fixture on the planet – Super Bowl LIV in Miami. It could be a free-scoring battle to lift the Vince Lombardi trophy with the likes of Lamar Jackson’s Baltimore Ravens and Drew Brees’ New Orleans Saints in the mix – although you should never write off the Patriots. Staying stateside, look out for the NBA’s All-Star weekend in Chicago, and the Daytona 500 this month. Elsewhere, the Champions League returns with thrills and spills guaranteed in the last 16, and at the end of the month there are rainbow jerseys to be won at the track cycling worlds in Berlin. 1-2 Feb Cyclo-cross world championships (Switz)2 Super Bowl LIV (Miami)5-11 New Zealand v India ODI series12-26 South Africa v England T20 series16 NBA All-Star game (Chicago)18-19, 25-26 Champions League last 16, first leg20-24 NZ v India first Test (Wellington)21-24 WGC golf (Mexico)21-26 South Africa v Australia T20 series21-8 Mar Women's T20 World Cup (Australia)22 Boxing: Fury v Wilder (Las Vegas)22 World Club challenge: St Helens v Sydney23 Nascar Daytona 50026-1 Mar UCI track world championships (Berlin)28-3 Mar NZ v India second Test (Christchurch)29 Women’s League Cup final29 South Africa v Australia ODI series The women’s T20 World Cup concludes in Melbourne, where Australia will be hot favourites to defend their title. England will be targeting the final after getting a favourable draw, but must avoid a repeat of the one-sided defeat inflicted by the Aussies in 2018. Australia will host both editions of the T20 World Cup this year, with the men's event kicking off in October. The women's event begins in late February, with the knockout stages in March. The 10 teams are split into two groups of five who will play a round-robin, with the top two from each group reaching the semi-finals.

Elsewhere, it’s arguably the biggest week in horse racing at the Cheltenham Festival, while England play two Test matches in Sri Lanka. Scotland and the Republic of Ireland will battle for the final Euro 2020 places as 16 teams are cut down to four in the play-offs. The world indoor athletics championships in China offer Olympic hopefuls the chance to tune up for Tokyo, and summer creeps in with the cycling classics and Major League baseball seasons getting under way. The month ends with the men’s and women’s Boat Races on the Thames. 1 EFL Trophy final2-11 Algarve Cup (Portugal)3-4 FA Cup fifth round9-16 Indian Wells Masters10-11 Champions League last 16, second leg10-13 Cheltenham Festival12-18 India v South Africa ODI series13-20 Australia v NZ ODI series (Aus)15 F1 Australian GP (Melbourne)19-23 Sri Lanka v England first Test (Galle)22 F1 Bahrain GP (Sakhir)24-29 NZ v Australia T20 series (NZ)13-15 World indoor athletics championship (Nanjing)17-18 Champions League last 16, second leg17-6 April NCAA March Madness basketball20 Champions League quarter-final draw21-22 FA Cup quarter-finals22-4 Apr Aus v SA women's T20/ODI series23 Milan-San Remo cycling23-30 Miami Open tennis26 MLB opening day26-31 Euro 2020 play-offs27-31 Sri Lanka v England second Test (Colombo)27-31 WGC Match Play golf (Austin)29 The Boat Races The first LPGA major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, is held in California. One week later, it’s over to Augusta for the first men’s golf major of the year, with Tiger Woods defending his Masters title. The first-ever Vietnam Grand Prix will race through the streets of Hanoi, and the NFL draft will be held in Las Vegas. More traditional sporting highlights include the Grand National – with Tiger Roll chasing a hat-trick of wins – the start of cricket’s County Championship season, the London Marathon and two weeks of tension at the Crucible, as Judd Trump battles to retain his world snooker title. 2-5 LPGA: ANA Inspiration (California)3-5 European Champions Cup quarter-finals4 Grand National (Aintree)5 F1 Vietnam GP (Hanoi)5 NHL play-offs begin7-8 Champions League quarter-finals, first leg9-12 The Masters (Augusta)12 County Championship begins13-19 Monte-Carlo Masters14 Paris-Roubaix cycling14-15 Champions League QFs, second leg16 NBA play-offs begin18-19 FA Cup semi-finals18-4 May World snooker championship19 F1 Chinese GP (Shanghai)22 Liège-Bastogne-Liège cycling23 NFL Draft (Las Vegas)24 Flèche Wallonne cycling25-26 Women’s Champions League semis, first leg26 London Marathon28-29 Champions League semi-finals, first leg30-3 May Tour de Yorkshire cycling  It’s a month of finals, with the men’s and women’s FA Cup showpieces at Wembley, the women’s Champions League in Vienna and the men’s Champions League in Istanbul. Not forgetting the Scottish Cup, Europa League and EFL play-offs, with football’s richest game, the Championship play-off final, offering a lucrative place in the Premier League. The first of cycling’s three Grand Tours, the Giro d’Italia, starts on foreign soil – in Budapest, to be precise. The Netherlands hosts an F1 Grand Prix in a busy month for motor sport, with the Indy 500 and Monaco GP also taking place. May ends with the second tennis grand slam of the year, the French Open, as the sporting summer comes into view. 1-3 European Champions Cup semi-finals1-17 Ice hockey world championship (Switz)2 Kentucky Derby (Churchill Downs)2-3 Women’s Champions League semis, second leg3 F1 Netherlands Grand Prix (Zandvoort)4-10 Madrid Open tennis5-6 Champions League semi-finals, second leg9 Women’s FA Cup Final (Wembley)9-31 Giro d’Italia cycling10 F1 Spanish GP (Barcelona)11-17 Italian Open tennis14-17 US PGA championship (Harding Park)14-19 Ireland v Bangladesh ODI series 16 League Two play-off final22 European Challenge Cup final (Marseille)23 FA Cup final23 European Champions Cup final (Marseille)24 F1 Monaco GP (Monte Carlo)24 Women’s Champions League final (Vienna)24 League One play-off final24 Indianapolis 50025 Scottish Cup final25 Championship play-off final25-1 Jun French Open tennis27 Europa League final (Gdansk)28 T20 Blast begins30 Champions League final (Istanbul)30 Women's Premier 15s final Euro 2020 kicks off this month, and will be hosted by 12 different cities from Dublin to Baku. England and Wales are the only qualified home nations so far, with Scotland and Republic of Ireland in the play-offs. England will play their group games at Wembley, plus the semi-finals and final - if they get that far. Gareth Southgate’s side are in Group D with Croatia, Czech Republic and a play-off winner. Wales are in Group A, with a trip to face Italy and two other games in Azerbaijan, against Switzerland and Turkey. If that sounds tough, spare a thought for the play-off winners who end up in Group F – with Germany, France and holders Portugal. Sixteen teams will progress from the groups into a straight knockout.

England play three home Tests against the West Indies, and there are three golf majors as the US Open, women’s US Open and women’s PGA are contested in the US. There are also three big rugby union finals, with the Premiership, Pro14 and Super Rugby trophies to be won. The Tour de France sets off from Nice on the long road to Paris. It’s hard to bet against another Team Ineos winner, but will it be defending champion Egan Bernal, or can Geraint Thomas or Chris Froome secure another British win? Speaking of which, this could be a big month for Andy Murray, with Queen’s Club and a potential Wimbledon return as he continues his fightback from injury. 4-7 LPGA: US Open (Texas)4-8 England v West Indies first Test (Oval)6 The Derby (Epsom)7 F1 Azerbaijan GP (Baku)10 Scotland v New Zealand T20 (Edinburgh)12 Scotland v New Zealand ODI (Edinburgh)12-16 England v WI second Test (Edgbaston)12-12 July Euro 2020 (various)12-12 July Copa América (Argentina/Colombia)13-14 Le Mans 24 Hours14 F1 Canadian GP (Montreal)15-21 Queen’s Club Championships16-20 Royal Ascot18-21 US Open golf (Winged Foot)19-23 Ireland v NZ T20 series20 Premiership final (Twickenham)20 Pro14 final (Cardiff)20 Super Rugby final25-28 Women’s PGA Championship (Penn)25-29 England v WI third Test (Lord’s)27-2 Jul Ireland v NZ ODI series27-19 Jul Tour de France28 Jun F1 French GP (Le Castellet)29 Jun Scotland v Australia T20 (Edinburgh)29-12 Jul WimbledonTBC NBA FinalsTBC NHL: Stanley Cup finals  It’s the biggest sporting event on earth; 11,000 athletes from more than 200 nations, competing in 339 events across 33 sports. The 32nd Olympic Games, the second to be held in Tokyo, will dominate the sporting summer. While Rio 2016 suffered from big distances between venues and poor infrastructure, that shouldn’t be a problem in Tokyo. Thirteen of the venues, including the National Stadium, are within 5km of the athletes’ village, although the marathon and walking events will be in the northern city of Sapporo, due to concerns over heat. British medal hopes include Dina Asher-Smith in the 200m and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in heptathlon, Adam Peaty in the pool, Laura Kenny in the velodrome and 11-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown. New events to watch out for include 3-on-3 basketball, surfing, speed climbing, skateboarding and karate, while baseball and softball will be popular draws in Japan after being brought back to the Games.

Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep are looking to defend their Wimbledon titles, while Lewis Hamilton will go for a seventh British Grand Prix crown at Silverstone.

Eight new city franchises have drafted players, with men’s and women’s teams competing for a place in the inaugural finals in August. Time will tell if the bold new format - 15 six-ball overs, then a 10-ball final over - will draw more casual fans than the disbanded Women’s Super League, or the men’s county-based T20 Blast, which will continue.

British names to watch out for include runner Sophie Hahn, former swimming medallist turned para-canoeist Charlotte Henshaw and Amy Truesdale, who is chasing gold in the new para-taekwondo event. Elsewhere, England complete what’s sure to be an entertaining Test series against Pakistan, while the year’s third and final grand tour, the Vuelta, begins with a jaunt to the Dutch city of Utrecht. The domestic football season kicks off too, with the Premier League and Football League returning early in August. 2 F1 Hungarian GP (Budapest)7-9 Football League returns7-11 England v Pakistan 2nd Test (Old Trafford)10-16 Canadian Open tennis14 The Hundred: women’s final14-6 Sep Vuelta a Espana cycling14-16 Premier League returns15 The Hundred: men’s final15-16 RideLondon cycling16-23 World rowing championships (Slovenia)17-23 Cincinnati Masters18-21 T20 Blast quarter-finals20-23 Women’s British Open (Scotland)20-24 England v Pakistan 3rd Test (Trent Bridge)25-6 Paralympic Games (Tokyo)26-30 European athletics championships (France)29-2 Sep England v Pakistan T20 series30 F1 Belgian GP (Spa)30 MotoGP British Grand Prix31-13 Sep US Open tennis Europe are bidding to retain the Ryder Cup trophy they won emphatically in France two years ago, as the USA takes over hosting duties. Europe lead 7-2 in wins since the turn of the century and will fancy their chances of an away win at Whistling Straits. The lakeside Wisconsin course looks and feels like Scottish links, complete with sheep, stone bridges and testing weather conditions. September also sees T20 Blast finals day, the Royal London Cup final and the county championship’s closing rounds. The Tour of Britain begins with a first-ever visit to Cornwall, while the road cycling world championships take place amid the peaks of Vaud and Valais in Switzerland. 5 T20 Blast finals day (Edgbaston)6 F1 Italian GP (Monza)6-13 Sep Tour of Britain cycling10 NFL season begins10-15 England v Ireland ODI series12 St Leger Stakes (Doncaster)13 Great North Run19 Royal London Cup final (Trent Bridge)20 F1 Singapore GP (Marina Bay)20-27 Cycling road world championships (Switz)22 County championship final round25-27 Ryder Cup (Whistling Straits, Wisconsin)26 AFL grand final (Melbourne)27 Russian GP (Sochi)27 Berlin marathon29-18 Oct Baseball: MLB play-offs There’s a double helping of T20 World Cups in 2020, with the men’s tournament also taking place in Australia at some of cricket’s most iconic venues, from the Gabba to the MCG.
