A five-runner renewal of the Grade One Challow Hurdle at Newbury is likely to see Thyme Hill going off at odds-on to maintain his unbeaten record over hurdles but there are a couple of live dangers despite the small field. Enrilo rediscovered the winning thread at Sandown last time after a headstrong display at Ludlow but The Cashel Man (3.00) could prove to be the value here. He was racing in handicap company at Newbury last time but could not have been more impressive when coming 10 lengths clear and did so in a good time. Newbury 1.50 The five-year-old Now Look At Me has been beaten less than a length on his last two starts but lost a shoe when coming up just short at Fontwell last time and remains on what looks like a winning mark. Lingfield 2.10 A big field of very closely matched handicappers is reflected in the betting. Luck in running could be vital but Petit Palais is at least unexposed on the Flat and has hurdles form to suggest an opening mark of 80 might not be beyond him. Newbury 2.25 Earlier this month Copperhead did not put a foot wrong when winning his second start over fences at Wincanton and he remains open to plenty of improvement. Leicester 2.40 The race at Fontainebleu which Eureu Du Boulay won was not hugely competitive but Richard Hobson’s runner could certainly not have won any more easily and he could be up to defying top weight here. Leicester 3.15 Last time Little Rory Mac took a big step forward at Market Rasen and several that followed him home have run well subsequently. Destin D’Ajonc, from the in-form Jonjo O’Neill yard, may be the biggest danger. Newbury 3.35 Jockey bookings suggest that Burbank is Nicky Henderson’s second-string here but 10-1 still looks a fair price. He has been eased a couple of pounds since finishing fifth at Sandown earlier this month on his first start since May and does not need to progress much to be competitive.
