Glenn Maxwell has taken another positive step in his comeback from a mental health break, with the all-rounder training with the Victoria Sheffield Shield squad. Maxwell stepped away from cricket, citing mental health issues, during Australia’s Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka in October. He has played three Victorian Premier Cricket matches with club side Fitzroy Doncaster since and has taken part in some aspects of Victoria’s Shield program. But Thursday morning’s hit-out at the MCG was the first time Maxwell has completed a full session with his teammates since he stepped away from the game. “I think he is doing everything he needs to do ... when he is ready to come back (he will),” teammate Marcus Harris said. “I’m not sure if it is this week or Big Bash, but he’s not far away I think.” Victoria batsmen Will Pucovski and Nic Maddinson have also recently taken breaks to deal with mental health issues. Both returned for this week’s drawn game against NSW at the MCG where Pucovski made a gritty 82 and Maddinson an impressive 59. Victoria take on Western Australia at the MCG starting on Saturday, but Maxwell was not named in that squad. This weekend’s matches are part of the last Shield round before the BBL break, where Maxwell is captain of Melbourne Stars. Harris said it will be left to Maxwell to decide when he feels the time is right to return to the game on a full-time basis. “I think those sort of guys need some space,” he said. “I think they’ve got everyone hounding them about what’s going on and what they’re doing. They are adults. Maxi has been really good and all the guys dealing with stuff have been very good and we just put our arm around them and support them.”
