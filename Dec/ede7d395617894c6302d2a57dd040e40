The former Newcastle and West Ham manager Alan Pardew has been appointed as head coach of struggling Eredivisie side ADO Den Haag. The 58-year-old has been out of work since being sacked by West Brom in April 2018, and will now be tasked with keeping the second-bottom Storks in the Dutch top flight. Pardew takes Chris Powell with him as his assistant, although it is understood Powell will also continue his role as a coach with the England national set-up. “In the search for a new challenge I’m glad that I came across ADO Den Haag,” Pardew said in the statement announcing his appointment. “It is a beautiful and warm club, where everything starts with enthusiasm and passion. The team is in a difficult period, but we will do everything we can to turn the tide. We must do that together – with the players, the staff and the fans.” Pardew’s contract is until the end of the current season and he inherits a side with just 13 points from 18 matches, including three wins. He replaces Dirk Heesen, who took charge on a temporary basis following the departure of Alfons Groenendijk earlier this month. De Haag are without a win since 26 October and Pardew’s first game in the dugout will be at home to bottom side RKC Waalwijk on 19 January. As well as spells at West Brom, Newcastle and West Ham, the well-travelled Pardew has also managed Reading, Charlton, Southampton and Crystal Palace.
