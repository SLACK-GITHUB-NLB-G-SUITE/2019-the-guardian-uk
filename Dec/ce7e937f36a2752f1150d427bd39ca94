Tyson Fury has accepted Anthony Joshua’s offer to be his sparring partner if it helps his fellow Brit beat Deontay Wilder. Joshua has been left frustrated in his attempts to lure WBC heavyweight champion Wilder into the ring as he bids to unify the division. Joshua, who now holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO belts following his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr, feels he has a better chance of landing a blockbuster unification showdown with Fury than with Wilder. Fury faces a rematch with the American on 22 February, having drawn their first encounter, and Joshua told Sky Sports News: “I think honestly he might beat Wilder next time. I think Fury would fight me quicker than Wilder would, so, if that’s the case, I want him to win. Imagine that fight on British soil. If Tyson needs me, I’ll go out and spar with him to get him ready for Wilder.” And @Tyson_Fury has responded😲 https://t.co/I20mWZmwx7 pic.twitter.com/nJh1mNwi2O In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Fury said he would be happy to spar with Joshua. “I’ve just seen the video of Joshua saying he’d love to come and help me in camp and that I’d fight him quicker than Wilder, that’s for sure,” Fury said. “When I beat Wilder I will fight you AJ, no problem. “I would love to have you in camp, really really love to have in camp work out for this fight and give Deontay Wilder a proper beating. I hope you mean it, because I’d love to have you in training camp with me.” Joshua, 30, remains desperate for a mega-fight with Wilder which would see both men attempt to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis. “It still puzzles me as to why it’s so difficult to pin this man down,” Joshua added. “This is the man I need to pin down to get the last ring and conquer this division. When he’s ready, as I am, I would love to be here talking about Deontay Wilder and the keys to victory. “It’s not about me, it’s about the sport and the legacy. If he wants to create his legacy and he wants to be a future hall of famer, he needs to come and see us. You’ve got the two lords of the rings here. The last one to unify, undisputed, the division. I’ve got four, he’s got one. I just need one more.” In the meantime Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev is the IBF’s next mandatory challenger for Joshua, while the WBO has ordered the Londoner to fight Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk. “Pulev is a very tough athlete,” said Joshua. “He knows what he’s doing and anyone fighting for the championship is a dangerous fighter. My mindset? Seek and destroy. “Usyk is a great cruiserweight has moved up to be in with the big boys. He will be in my sights for around March or April, and he’s a very credible opponent. I want fighters like him on my record. I’ve been studying him already.” And as for a potential third meeting with Ruiz Jr, the Mexican who stunned the boxing world by beating Joshua in June? “One trillion per cent,” he said. “I always said I’d fight him in Tijuana, with his uncle as referee. Me and Andy will soon see each other in the ring again.”
