You say the Advanced Passenger Train had been canned “partly because of the motion sickness it allegedly induced” (End of era for Virgin: Why track record is mixed for Branson’s red trains, 7 December). Pendolino trains do induce motion sickness, as I can testify. It’s one of the reasons (not to mention the price) I choose to travel via the slightly slower Chiltern line, which is more efficient as I’m not prevented by nausea from working on the train.Margaret JacobiBirmingham • I went to vote then came home to read my Guardian. The superlative collection on the letters page (12 December) left me weeping – and praying that all the thought-waves encapsulated there could somehow echo way beyond the confines of the Guardian chamber and save the country: hopeless, I know, but this naive girl has to dream.Alexandra ShepherdAberdeen • Your Birdwatch column referring to The 12 Days of Christmas (11 December) brought back memories of our first Christmas in our old chapel home in Northamptonshire. My son and I went into the garden on 25 December and disturbed a partridge on the wall who flew to the end of the garden and landed in our pear tree!Gwen MathewsBulwick, Northamptonshire • Bah! Humbug! What about There’s No Santa Clause on The Midnight Stage by the terribly exciting Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band or Lou Reed’s No Christmas in February (Letters, 9 December)?Nik WoodLondon • 12 December: no Brexit or election natter on BBC TV and radio all day. Bliss! We ought to do this more often.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire • Lisa Hallgarten for poet laureate (Letters, 12 December).David WittMalmesbury, Wiltshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
