The UK finance director of Domino’s Pizza has drowned while on holiday with his family in Mauritius. The company said David Bauernfeind, 51, died in a snorkelling accident on the Indian Ocean island on Boxing Day. According to local reports, a British tourist, believed to be Bauernfeind, was found by a sailor off the coast of the island. He was taken back to shore and a postmortem found he had drowned. “We are all deeply shocked and saddened by this tragic news,” said David Wild, the company’s chief executive. “On behalf of our board, our colleagues and our franchisees, we send our heartfelt sympathies to David’s wife, Nicolette, and daughter, Ornella, as well as his wider family and friends.” Bauernfeind became the fourth person in four years to head the finance department at the pizza company when he was appointed in October 2018. He was previously the chief financial officer of Connect Group, the newspaper distribution company formerly owned by WH Smith, and also worked for 15 years at the technology firm Xchanging. The Mauritius newspaper L’Express reported that the body of the British tourist was found at 11.45am local time (0745 GMT) on Thursday off the coast of Belle Mare, on the east of the island. The body was taken to Victoria hospital, further inland. The cause of death was asphyxia due to drowning. “David was hugely liked and deeply respected for his dedication and sharp intellect amongst Domino’s colleagues. He was a force for good within the business and will be greatly missed,” Wild said.
