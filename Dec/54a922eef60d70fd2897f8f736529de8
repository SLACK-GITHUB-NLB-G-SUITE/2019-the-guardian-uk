Re the letters from Kay Murphy (27 November) and Estelle Smart (29 November), the Hexham Courant reported on a hustings event last week. When asked about the use of the local food bank, the Conservative candidate is quoted as saying: “You will not improve the long-term capability of handling finances without better financial education from primary school upwards. We must get better at handling money.” What a pity that the increasing number of people who have to rely on food banks just can’t manage the money that they haven’t got.Bridget CuthbertsonHexham, Northumberland • Reading your article (George the Poet on why he had to say no to an MBE, 30 November), I was reminded of the historian RH Tawney, who said of peerages: “Cruel boys tie tin cans to the tails of dogs; but even a mad dog does not tie a can to its own tail.”Judy TurnerMalvern, Worcestershire • If Nigel Farage is such a good friend of Donald Trump, he should know that Trump is a teetotaller, and so his sexist comments would not come “after a night out with a drink” (The verdict: Friends in high places a hindrance for Farage, 2 December).Joe LockerSurbiton, London • It was Rhett Butler who said “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn” (Letters, 30 November). Scarlett O’Hara said “I’ll think about it tomorrow”, a mantra obviously adopted by the climate deniers.Kathy ArundaleAltrincham, Greater Manchester • Thank you to Richard Walker for pointing out that it should be attender, not attendee (Letters, 30 November). I’ve been an annoyee about this point for ages.Susan SaundersTeddington, London • Keep the colourful Eyewitness centre spread photos coming, I need them to wrap my Christmas presents.Chris JonesBewdley, Worcestershire
