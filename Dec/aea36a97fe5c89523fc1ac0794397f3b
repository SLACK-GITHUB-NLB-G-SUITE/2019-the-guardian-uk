Stunning outdoor ice rinks can be found in town squares, city centres, ski resorts and, in the far north – where thick ice is reliable – on natural lakes. Tell us about a winter break, ski holiday or Christmas trip that involved skating. Include details of the rink’s setting – the buildings, cafes, bars are all part of the jollity and there may be some interesting historical details worth describing. Outdoor rinks in the UK tend to close early in the new year, whereas in mainland Europe they often stay open will into March, so while UK tips are welcome our shortlist will be more oriented towards the continent. Please don’t send us a tip on an unofficial rink … so no temporarily frozen rivers or canals please, for obvious reasons. Let us know details of locations, websites and prices. Please ensure your tip stays within around 100 words. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words.
