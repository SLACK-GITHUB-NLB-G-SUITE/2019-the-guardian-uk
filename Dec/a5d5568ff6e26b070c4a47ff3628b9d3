A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the death of two women outside a property in West Sussex. Police said they were called to an address in Crawley Down shortly before 10.20am on Sunday morning, where they also found a seriously injured man inside. DCI Alex Geldart, of the Sussex and Surrey major crime team, who is leading the investigation, said: “At this time we believe this to be an isolated incident, with no ongoing risk to members of the public. This is a fast-moving investigation which will see significant police resources deployed to the scene for the foreseeable future. We are grateful for the support and patience of the local community while we conduct our inquiries.” She added: “My thoughts are very much with the friends and family of the two women who have sadly lost their lives.” Pictures taken at the scene on Hazel Way showed white sheets covering what were believed to be two bodies. A neighbour told PA Media there were seven police cars and two ambulances parked in the street and a helicopter overhead. “All I know is that I was coming home from Crawley at around 11.30am and I was passed by the ambulance crews and most of the police cars,” he said. Police appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them. They said they would not be providing any further information at this stage. Three forensics tents were pitched in the street, while residents said 10 police cars had initially been dispatched to the scene to deal with the incident. Investigators in white suits could be seen combing the area for evidence. A police cordon remained in place around the houses close to where the bodies were found.
