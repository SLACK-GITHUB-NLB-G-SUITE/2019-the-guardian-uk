1) Artem Bahmet, remember the name. Why? Because the unranked Ukrainian lost all 48 points in a 6-0, 6-0 defeat by Krittin Koaykul in a qualifier at the ITF World Tennis Tour M15 event in Doha. The lesser-spotted golden set. Look how bad he is? Then look again. Tennis may just have found its own Maurice Flitcroft. 2) South African spin bowler Tabraiz Shamsi is not the only sportsperson to perform an on-pitch magic trick. Here’s Venezuela forward César Martínez making the ball levitate after scoring for Zamora in 2015. No, we don’t know how he did it either. And who can forget the little magician Santi Cazorla appearing from thin air when he returned to Villarreal in 2018. 3) The Women’s World Floorball Championships are under way in Switzerland. Floorball is a fast-paced indoor version of field hockey or ice hockey with a bit less sliding. Sweden are the holders, and this is how they won it last time out, in 2017. And here’s a display of freestyle floorball trickery. 4) Tiémoué Bakayoko has worn No 14 for Monaco, Milan and Chelsea, but switched to No 6 on his return to Monaco this season. Not that he remembered when his (old) number came up at the weekend. 5) Every angle of Steven Adams’s NFL-style pass that helped Oklahoma City Thunder tie their NBA game and set up an overtime win against Minnesota Timberwolves 6) Don’t look down. Difference in weather between two sides of the mountain pic.twitter.com/ngB1wAtTTQ 1) Tim Paine takes us behinds the scenes in the Aussie dressing room immediately after the win over Pakistan. Absolute mess! 2) If Damon Hill appearing in Vic and Bob comedy sketches is what you want, then (humbly) we’d say this is the one you want. 3) How about this for a golf trick shot?
