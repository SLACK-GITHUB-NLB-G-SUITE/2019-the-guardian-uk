Swansea are in talks to sign Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster on loan for the remainder of the season. Several other Championship clubs are also interested in the 19-year-old but Swansea hope that the lure of working with Steve Cooper again will sway the forward in joining them on 1 January. Cooper and Brewster have worked together before at England level, the two of them winning the Under-17 World Cup together in 2017. Brewster finished as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. Brewster has made only two appearances for the Liverpool first team so far this season, both in the Carabao Cup, against MK Dons and Arsenal, and other attack-minded youngsters, such as Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott, appear to be closer to playing for Jürgen Klopp’s side at the moment. Brewster, who joined Liverpool aged 14 from Chelsea’s youth set-up in 2014, signed a five-year contract with Liverpool in the summer of 2018 but has yet to experience regular first-team football and a loan move to a Championship club seems the logical next step.
