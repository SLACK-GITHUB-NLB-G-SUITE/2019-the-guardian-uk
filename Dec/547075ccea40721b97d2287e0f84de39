Julian Wilson has booked his spot in the Australia team for the 2020 Tokyo Games, when surfing will make its Olympics debut. Wilson was eliminated in the last 16 of the Pipe Masters in Hawaii on Thursday (Friday AEDT), but countryman Jack Freestone’s defeat in the quarter-finals means Wilson will join Owen Wright in Australia’s team for next year’s Olympics in Japan. Queenslander Wilson is currently 11th in the rankings, three places above Freestone, who needed to win the event at Pipeline to secure an Olympics berth. Aussies Wilson and Soli Bailey suffered losses to Yago Dora and John John Florence respectively in the last 16 at Oahu, with Freestone beating New Zealander Ricardo Christie to reach the quarter-finals. Freestone was then beaten 12.94 points to 9.26 by legendary American surfer Kelly Slater in the last eight, ending both his Olympics dream and his chance to win the prestigious Triple Crown of Surfing. Slater, however, was later defeated in a semi-final heat by Brazil’s Italo Ferreira 14.77 to 2.57, finishing the season without enough points to make the two-man team the United States will send to Japan. The two spots in the men’s team go to Florence and Kolohe Andino, while Carissa Moore and Caroline Marks have already qualified for Team USA’s first women’s squad. Andino had his hopes of being crowned 2019 world champion dashed after his defeat to France’s Michel Bourez in the last 16.
