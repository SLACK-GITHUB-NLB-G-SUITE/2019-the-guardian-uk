In mid-November, I sent my wife’s iPhone to a company called Quick Fix Mobile which advertises 24 or 48 hour service. The phone needed the battery replacing and I used its courier as directed. The phone only arrived with the company five days days after posting. A week later I was told the technicians were still looking into it. After a further week passed, it emerged that there was a two-week backlog for battery repairs. At this point I decided that I just wanted the phone back. But try as I might, I can’t get through to this firm. Can you please get my phone back, and the £37 I paid? ML, Crowborough, East Sussex We did manage to get your repaired phone back, and a refund of the money, but blimey, it was hard work. Quick Fix Mobile is one of those infuriating companies with no phone number listed on their website. It ignored our first email, and only when sent a second did the firm respond. The company denied it was ignoring you and said that more than 50 emails passed between you. It has repaired your phone for free as a gesture of goodwill.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
