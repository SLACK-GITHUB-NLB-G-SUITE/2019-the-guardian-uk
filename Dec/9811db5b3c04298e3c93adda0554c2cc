New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones was kept out of practice on Wednesday with a high ankle sprain, and coach Pat Shurmur says Eli Manning is “very likely” to start on Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. The injury could sideline Jones for a few weeks, meaning Manning could start for the remainder of the season. The rookie Jones has been the starter since the third game of the season, which the Giants won 32-31 at Tampa Bay. They beat Washington the next week, but have lost eight straight games since. Jones, a first-round pick for the Giants, has completed 61% of his passes (228 of 370) for 2,374 yards and 18 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. Injuries to players such Evan Engram and Golden Tate have meant he has been without some of the team’s top receivers. Manning, the team’s starter since 2004, played the first two games this season, completing 56 of 89 passes for 556 yards and two TDs with two interceptions. There has been speculation that he would retire at the end of this season after losing the starter’s job to Jones.
