Disney is facing criticism for its decision to produce a spin-off film focused on a minor white character from its live-action remake of Aladdin. The project was revealed to the Hollywood Reporter on Friday afternoon, and will see the actor Billy Magnussen reprise his role as the affable, goofy Prince Anders. Jordan Dunn and Michael Kvamme will act as screenwriters. The film is to premiere on Disney’s new streaming service, Disney+. “So... uh... just after the news the actor who played Aladdin can’t get work, Disney announces a spin-off about the token white guy in one scene!” one fan wrote on Twitter. Many fans are confused by the decision. Prince Anders, an original character created for the live-action version, only appeared in a few scenes. Some wonder why, in a film replete with characters of color, the studio is focusing on a white one. Mena Massoud, who played Aladdin in this year’s live-action remake, made news this week after he opened up about struggling to land auditions, even after starring in a film that grossed over $1bn. “I’m kind of tired of staying quiet about it,” Massoud told the Daily Beast. “I want people to know that it’s not always dandelions and roses when you’re doing something like Aladdin. ‘He must have made millions. He must be getting all these offers.’ It’s none of those things. I haven’t had a single audition since Aladdin came out.” The admission sparked conversations about the struggles actors of color face in Hollywood. When asked about Massoud’s admission during a press interview, Will Smith, who played Genie in Aladdin, responded: “The thing about this business, that is not unlike life: it’s hard by design. It’s like the universe, God, whatever you believe designed it to be hard, right? So, if you’re having a hard time, it’s because you’re supposed to.” Disney was not immediately available for comment.
