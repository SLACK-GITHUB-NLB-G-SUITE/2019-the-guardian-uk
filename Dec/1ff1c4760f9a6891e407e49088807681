Harry: This National Poetry Day I performed alongside [poet] Paul Cookson, who at one point had a roomful of primary school children joining in with a poem about bums. By the end of it, they were rolling on the floor unable to breathe because they were laughing so much. Chris: JK! Studios’ Happy Fun Friends sketch is amazing. They’re a Utah sketch group and aside from being very nice people – they’re Mormons so I think it comes with the territory – they’re incredibly funny. Harry: Not an intentional heckle but I did go to high five a woman in the front row during a gig in Macclesfield. But by the time I got there, she had fallen asleep, which her friends found very funny. Chris: I once woke myself up by laughing at a dream, but I can’t remember what it was. I think it involved a heist, Alex Horne and several dogs. Chris: Wishing someone a “happy Christmas period” and worrying they might misconstrue it as a reference to menstruation. Harry: The German word for slug is nacktschnecke, which translates as “naked snail”, and is only topped by the German word for nipple: brustwarze, or “breast-wart”.
