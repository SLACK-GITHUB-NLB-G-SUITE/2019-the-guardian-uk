England Women beat Pakistan by 26 runs to win their Twenty20 International series 3-0 in Kuala Lumpur. Heading into the match with an unassailable 2-0 lead, Katherine Brunt and Nat Sciver were rested as England took the opportunity to look at a few options before the Women’s T20 World Cup. It did not affect the team’s performance as England completed a whitewash win. Captain Heather Knight was top-scorer with 43 as her side scored 170 for three, while Pakistan managed 144 for five in response. Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn, who has impressed having been selected for England for the first time on this tour, shared the five wickets between them. Knight said: “I think it’s been a good tour for us. I think we’ve found some new players, as well. Sarah Glenn has really put her hand up and that’s great for us, it adds to the competition for places and makes us stronger as a group. “I’ve been proud of how we’ve maintained our high standards, especially in the field – which is something we’ve been working hard on. We’re looking forward to the new year and the challenge of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia.”
