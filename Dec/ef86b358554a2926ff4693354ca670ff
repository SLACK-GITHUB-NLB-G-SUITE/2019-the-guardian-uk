The Souvenir, Joanna Hogg’s loosely autobiographical film about a student who embarks on a relationship with a mysterious older man, has emerged as the leading contender at the London critics’ circle film awards, after nominations were announced today. Hogg’s film was nominated in seven categories, including film of the year, British/Irish film of the year, and acting nods for Tom Burke, Honor Swinton Byrne, and Tilda Swinton. Hogg was nominated for screenwriter of the year. Close behind were The Irishman, Martin Scorsese’s mob epic about mafia killer Frank Sheeran, and Sam Mendes’ first world war drama 1917. Both were nominated for film of the year and director of the year. Three of The Irishman’s actors received nominations – Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino – while 1917’s George Mackay was nominated for best British/Irish actor. The Syrian civil war documentary For Sama continued its impressive awards season run, picking up nominations for documentary of the year and breakthrough British/Irish film-maker. The winners of the London critics’ circle film awards will be announced on 30 January.
