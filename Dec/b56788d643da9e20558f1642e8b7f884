Size and fame don’t matter, we want to hear about city museums that have struck you as special in some way. It could be an institution with a huge range of displays or a small place with a niche collection. You may have visited an institution that opens in the evenings, so you can avoid the crowds, or one with particularly good guides at hand. It might have a cafe that you enjoyed visiting, or even a bar. Please don’t send in tips on out-of-town museums for this compilation, or anywhere in the UK – we’re looking for European city break locations this time. If possible, provide addresses and websites mentioned with exact locations. Let us know whether there is a cost involved or whether the museum is free to enter.
