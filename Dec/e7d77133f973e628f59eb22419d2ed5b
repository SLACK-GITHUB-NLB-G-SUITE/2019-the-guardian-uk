How does Sunday start? Slowly, around 11am. I have a coffee at home and then get dressed. I wear a black dress every day. My work involves so many decisions about colour and patterns that having a uniform means I simply don’t have to think. My partner jokes that people must think I only have one outfit. A day out? I’ve lived in London for 15 years, but there are still parts of the city I’m only now discovering. Last Sunday a friend took me to Hampstead for the first time. Do you work? I’ll finish what’s left over from Saturday: contracts and emails. I try to limit it to that, but in the run-up to shows it’s just not possible. Our last show was in Greece at the Temple of Poseidon. I spent a Sunday sorting the sand and the sound. Sundays growing up? They were all about family. My parents were entrepreneurs and worked the rest of the week. We’d be with family friends, playing games and eating Mum’s risottos, leek pies and roast chicken. I’m an only child, but our incredible network meant there were always other kids around. Out to eat? If we’ve got guests from out of town I’ll take them for a proper English tea; last time we chose Claridge’s. Otherwise you’ll find me at a gastropub two minutes from my house. The food is delicious. A special Sunday? The morning after I first kissed my boyfriend, now of 17 years. It was July in Athens, and in that moment we both realised it was the start of something. There was anticipation and excitement. And next week? I’ll be in Delhi. I can’t wait. I made my first trip to India – Mumbai – earlier this year, to see the incredible craftsmanship of the artists we worked with on our latest collection. Such precision and creativity. It certainly beats watching The Crown and checking my calendar – my standard Sunday-night routine. marykatrantzou.com
