Carlo Ancelotti has agreed a deal to take over as Evertonâ€™s manager and may forgo money he is owed by Napoli under the terms of his dismissal in order to speed his appointment at Goodison Park. Ancelotti was sacked by Napoli last week but remains under contract until June 2021. He will hold talks with the Serie A club and decide the best course of action to sever his ties and succeed Marco Silva at Everton. The 60-year-old, who was in London on Tuesday morning, has made it clear that he is only interested in a long-term deal with the club and has sought reassurances that there will be money to spend in the summer. The Italian has spent most of his career coaching teams in the Champions League but is attracted to the challenge of revitalising Everton, who are in a relegation battle but have beaten Chelsea and drawn with Manchester United in their past two matches under the caretaker Duncan Ferguson. Ancelotti has been keen to return to the Premier League, having managed Chelsea and won the Double with them in 2010.
