The former Leeds Rhinos great Rob Burrow has revealed that he has been diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Burrow retired after winning his eighth Super League Grand Final at the end of the 2017 season and is now the club’s reserve team head coach. The 37-year-old father of three spent his entire career at Leeds and made 492 appearances and also won 15 caps for England and five for Great Britain. “Regrettably, I am confirming that I have been diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease,” Burrow said in a statement. “I know I have a big challenge in front of me but knowing that I have the love and support of so many people will give me inspiration and strength. “I am very positive about the situation and intend to battle the condition as I still feel fit and well.” MND is a degenerative condition that affects how nerves in the brain and spinal cord function. There is currently no cure. Scotland rugby union great Doddie Weir, who revealed in June 2017 that he had been diagnosed with MND, is understood to have met with Burrow. Weir was honoured with the Helen Rollason Award, which recognises outstanding achievement in the face of adversity, at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year event on Sunday for his work in raising money into research to combat the disease. The former Liverpool and Bradford defender Stephen Darby has also spoken about living with the disease since he was forced to retire following his diagnosis in September 2018. Leeds have announced that the testimonial for Jamie Jones-Buchanan against Bradford Bulls on Sunday 12 January at Headingley will now be a joint-fundraiser for Jones Buchanan and Burrow.
