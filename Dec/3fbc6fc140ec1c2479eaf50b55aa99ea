The Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, stopped short of calling for the introduction of VAR in Scottish football after their defeat by Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final but did insist that officials need assistance when it comes to borderline decisions. Gerrard praised the performance of his side as they dominated much of the game against Celtic but lost to a Christopher Jullien goal that television pictures suggested was offside. “I think it [VAR] has taken something away from the game, so I’d be a liar if I said I’m 100% in favour of it,” said Gerrard. “But one thing I do know is the officials up here do need some support and help. Because there are too many things, not just for our club but across the board, that they maybe miss and need a bit of support on. “We conceded from a set-piece, which we shouldn’t have given away. Once you concede it, you have to defend it better. There were three Celtic players standing in offside positions but unfortunately we play in a country where there is no VAR. “We still have to defend it better but, that aside, we were outstanding. We created all the best chances.” His opposite number was fully appreciative of the significance of the win. It was Neil Lennon’s first League Cup final triumph as manager and also gave him the particular honour of keeping company with the late Billy McNeill by becoming the second man in Scotland to win all three domestic trophies as player and manager with one club. “It means the world to me,” Lennon said. “The League Cup has been something of a monkey on my back. It owed me one. It’s just nice to tick that box as a manager. You want to do it in spectacular fashion at times but that’s not always possible.”
