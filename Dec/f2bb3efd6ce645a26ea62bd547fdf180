The very public arrest of Carlos Ghosn moments after his private jet landed at Tokyo airport in November 2018 sent shockwaves through the corporate world. It was a steep fall from grace for the titan of the global car industry, the man who revived the fortunes of Japan’s Nissan and Renault of France, forging an alliance with Mitsubishi that created the world’s second-largest car manufacturer. He chaired all three companies simultaneously and was also chief executive of Renault. In Japan, where foreign company bosses are rare, he achieved superstar status for revitalising Nissan – his hero status was such that his life was serialised in one of the country’s famous manga comic books. Born in Brazil in 1954 to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn (pronounced “gone” as in “phone”) also holds French and Lebanese passports. He studied at the prestigious École Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer, where he spent the first 18 years of his career. He was poached by Renault in 1996, where he was nicknamed “Le Cost Killer” for his brutal restructuring programme. He repeated that at Nissan after Renault took a 43.4% stake in 1999, cementing his status as one of the world’s most successful business leaders. Ghosn faces four charges of financial misconduct, including understating his pay and misusing company assets. While awaiting trial, he spent more than 120 days in detention before being released on bail for a second time in late April. His treatment drew international criticism.
