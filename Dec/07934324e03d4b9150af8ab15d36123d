The war of words between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns extended to their wardrobes on Sunday. After Browns coach Freddie Kitchens was spotted wearing a t-shirt that read “Pittsburgh started it”, a reference to the brawl that marred the end of Cleveland’s win over the Steelers last month, Cleveland wide receiver Jarvis Landry rocked a sweatshirt emblazoned with “Revenge” at Heinz Field hours before kickoff in Sunday’s rematch.

A handful wore shirts that screamed “Free Pouncey,” a nod to starting center Maurkice Pouncey, who is serving the second game of a two-game suspension for kicking and punching Browns defensive end Myles Garrett after Garrett ripped off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and smacked him with it. Pittsburgh cornerback Cam Sutton took a cruder approach, sporting a sweatshirt of a child in a Steelers helmet urinating on someone dressed in Browns gear. The Steelers went on to win the game 20-13. “I know that it is going to be a lot of trash talking out there and a lot of guys are going to try and get into your head and do things to try and get you out of character,” Browns defensive back Denzel Ward said before the game. “You just have to think about the betterment of the team and just go out there and win the game, but do not do any stupid penalties or anything toward the other team that could hurt this team.”
