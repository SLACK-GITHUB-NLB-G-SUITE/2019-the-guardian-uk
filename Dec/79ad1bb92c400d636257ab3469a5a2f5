One of our journalists may be in contact before any contributions are published, so please do leave your contact details. Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important. We recognise it may not always be safe or appropriate to record or share your experiences – so please think about this when deciding whether to record and again when deciding whether to send your content to the Guardian.
