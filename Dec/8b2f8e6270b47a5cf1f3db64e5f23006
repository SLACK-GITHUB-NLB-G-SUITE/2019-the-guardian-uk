Four-day Tests could soon feature in the Australian summer, with Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts backing calls for shorter matches. The ICC approved a trial of shortened Tests with 98 overs per day in 2017, with two having been played to this point. Former Australia captain and ex-board member Mark Taylor has been a known proponent of the idea, putting it in the same category as pink-ball matches for the traditional format. Roberts said it’s something CA would seriously consider as part of the next Future Tours program. “I think as we explore possibilities in the next cycle from 2023 to 2031, it’s very important we ask ourselves the right questions about cricket,” Roberts said. “We know having surveyed around 8,000 Australian fans a couple of years ago, the two main things they wanted were an expanded BBL and more innovation in Test cricket in the form of four-day Tests and day-night Tests. “It’s been great to have a couple of day-night Tests this year and we’ve got to look really seriously at the future of four-day Test cricket. And given the average length of Test matches are less than four days, then it’s something to consider really seriously in the next eight-year cycle from 2023.” Under the ICC’s trial, four-day matches can only be played in games that don’t count as World Test Championship fixtures, meaning they are likely set up for clashes with minnows. England played a four-day Test against Ireland earlier this year, while South Africa also hosted Zimbabwe in one in 2017. That means Australia’s first shot at a four-day Test could come against Afghanistan at the start of next summer. The advantage of four-day Tests means extra short-form matches could be scheduled, allowing for more exposure for minnows and extra television products. “Once this international season finishes that’s when we start the planning for the following season,” Roberts said.
