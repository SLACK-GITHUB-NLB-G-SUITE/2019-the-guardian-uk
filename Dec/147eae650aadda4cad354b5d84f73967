Always good to read the small print.Julie OwensCarlisle • It was a delight to read Michael Billington’s final review as your chief theatre critic, a four-star review of Pippi Longstocking (20 December), not because of its finality but because it’s so typically genuine and generous, and showed why his informed enthusiasm will be sorely missed.Robert SandersonRecently retired former manager of the Theatre Royal in Nottingham • Re your article (How much are we really telling Alexa?, G2, 17 December), are the military also listening in?
