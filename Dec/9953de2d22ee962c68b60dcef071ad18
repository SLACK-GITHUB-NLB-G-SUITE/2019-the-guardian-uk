Donald Trump’s re-election campaign will no longer issue press credentials to reporters for Bloomberg News, the agency owned by Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, the president’s campaign manager said on Monday. Following the billionaire former New York mayor’s formal announcement of his presidential bid last month, his news agency said it would no longer critically cover the Democratic presidential candidates. But it said it would go on covering Trump. In a statement on Monday, the Trump 2020 chief Brad Parscale said: “Bloomberg News has declared that they won’t investigate their boss or his Democrat competitors, many of whom are current holders of high office, but will continue critical reporting on President Trump. “Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. “We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis. This will remain the policy of the Trump campaign until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.” Bloomberg News’ editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, pushed back. “The accusation of bias couldn’t be further from the truth,” he said. “We have covered Donald Trump fairly [and] in an unbiased way since he became a candidate and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.”
