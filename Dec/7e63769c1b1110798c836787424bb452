Could someone please challenge Boris Johnson about the environmental implications of his trade policies? How can the commitment by the Tories to “get Brexit done” and focus on trade with countries beyond the EU squarewith the party’s pledge to prioritise the environment? Surely concentrating on trade deals and partnerships far away from our nearest neighbours must entail countless more air miles and far longer ocean journeys, with inevitable increased fuel costs and greater marine pollution? Yet another good reason for not turning our backs on our EU partners and for giving the public a chance to have a vote solely on Brexit, rather than deliberately confusing it with a host of other issues in this general election.Joyce QuinLabour, House of Lords • On Thursday evening we attended a climate hustings in Newton Abbot. All candidates for the two constituencies covered – Central Devon and Newton Abbot – were invited and both sets of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green party candidates took part. Neither of the Conservative candidates – the current MPs – appeared and were empty chaired. One refused several invitations and the other withdrew after initially accepting. The message from this is the Conservatives have nothing to say about climate change and are willing to treat their constituents with contempt.Colin CorkertonNewton Abbot, Devon • We wonder whether the “small earthquake” in Somerset (Report, theguardian.com, 6 December) might be the effect of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s unsuccessful attempts to blast his way out of the bunker that Tory central command has locked him up in pending the election.Meic and Valmai GoodyearLewes, East Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
