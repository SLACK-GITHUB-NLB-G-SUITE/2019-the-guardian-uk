Brendan Rodgers has committed his long-term future to Leicester by signing of a new contract to 2025. Rodgers, who was among the managers of interest to Arsenal in their search to replace Unai Emery, has taken Leicester to second in the Premier League since joining from Celtic in February. “When I made the decision to come to Leicester City, it was because I was excited about the direction the club was taking and how I could apply my experience to the journey,” Rodgers said after signing the new deal. “I came here with a purpose to add something to that and to help the club build for the future … I’ve inherited an outstanding team of staff that are dedicated to progress and improvement and we have a group of players that are a joy to work with every day.”
