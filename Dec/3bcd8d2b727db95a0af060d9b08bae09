As George Monbiot observes, the Independent Press Standards Organisation is “not fit for purpose”, and its complaints process “seems designed to deter” (Why do I have to break an embargo in order to expose press lies about Labour?, 10 December). Based on blueprints drawn up by two Conservative peers, overseen by a secretive committee of newspaper executives, and tasked with enforcing a code written by newspaper editors, the Ipso system is ineffective and riddled with pro-industry biases. While we at Hacked Off work mostly with individuals who have been personally affected by newspaper misconduct, Monbiot’s article highlights how the absence of independent and effective newspaper regulation in the UK can have wider societal effects, in particular on “the course of our politics”. Introducing the Leveson system of independent self-regulation is critical to restoring trust in the press and protecting the integrity of our democracy, and should be a priority for any incoming government.Nathan SparkesPolicy manager, Hacked Off • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
