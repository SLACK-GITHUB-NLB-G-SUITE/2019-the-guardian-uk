The historic unlawfull killing conclusions after the longest jury inquest in legal history led Hillsborough families to rightly expect accountability of those responsible. Their anger and disappointment at the conduct of the criminal trial is widely felt among all those affected by state-related failings and disasters, leaving these families to question how they will ever be able to obtain justice (Once again, the law has failed the victims of Hillsborough, 6 December). Across our work on state-related deaths, we see a stark inequality in funding and access to resources where powerful state or corporate interests are at stake. A culture of denial, delay and victim blaming is all too common, and bereaved families are left to fight at great personal cost to uncover the truth and accountability for their loved ones’ deaths. This cannot continue. The lasting legacy of Hillsborough must be the public authority accountability bill (Hillsborough law), enforcing a duty of candour and equality of arms. This could help a move from defensiveness to transparency and change the legal landscape following contentious deaths, making it fairer, just and more equal. This is what we should expect in a democratic society.
