Ole Gunnar Solskjær has aimed a dig at Manchester City before Saturday’s derby by stating that at least it now occurs every season, unlike when he was a player. Solskjær signed as a striker for Manchester United in summer 1996 with City outside of the top flight. They would not gain promotion to it until the 1999-2000 season. United’s manager was asked how the derby had changed since he was a player. “At least we play every year now,” he said. “[It] took many years before I played a Manchester derby myself [in 2001]. Man City are a better team now than when I was playing [and] football has changed quite a lot. “Then a few more proper tackles were allowed, without every little angle, everything being scrutinised. Now it’s more of a technical, tactical game than physical/mental. A derby should be played as a derby; we don’t play basketball and we’re ready if that happens.” Anthony Martial should be available after injury but Solskjær said Paul Pogba would not be back. “We hope to have Anthony definitely for part of the game,” he said. “Not sure if he’s able to start.” United are sixth with 21 points, 11 behind City, having beaten Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford scored both goals to take his Premier League tally to nine from 15 games, and he has 12 strikes in his past 13 appearances in all competitions. “He’s consistently now scoring – it’s not like four in one and two or three without,” Solskjær said. “It’s not just in spurts but he’s consistently getting chances and into better positions and on Wednesday night he was unbelievable and I hope to see that again.”
