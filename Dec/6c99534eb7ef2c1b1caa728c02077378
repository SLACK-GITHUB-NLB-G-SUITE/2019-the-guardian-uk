The first trailer for Marvel’s standalone Black Widow movie starring Scarlett Johansson has been released online. Johansson has already played the character, aka Natasha Romanoff, in a string of previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including Captain Marvel, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Romanoff is a former KGB assassin and current agent of SHIELD, Marvel’s fictional counter-terrorism organisation. Johansson is also acting as executive producer on the film, which is directed by Cate Shortland (Berlin Syndrome). At Comic-Con in July Johansson described the film: “Where we find Natasha in her life at this point is very specific …. She really is in a dark place where she’s got no one to call and nowhere to go. She’s really grappling with her own self … In that moment, you actually have to face yourself.” Black Widow is due for release on 30 April in Australia, and 1 May in the UK and US.
