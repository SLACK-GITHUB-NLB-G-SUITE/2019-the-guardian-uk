Lou Sanders is the best. Always funny – in front of 12 people in the basement of a pub or running off stage at the Apollo to get her Vote Labia bags to show an audience of 3,000. It’s not a sketch as such but in Edinburgh this year I saw a seagull crossing the road at the traffic lights. It was about 2 o’clock in the morning and the street was completely empty. I laughed for 10 minutes. Five stars. My dad showed us Bottom when we were far too little and I was obsessed. I used to watch the gas man episode on repeat. My mum. She’s the strongest, tiniest, funniest, most direct person I know. I was once saying good night to her and she pretended to be dead. I got really upset. She couldn’t stop laughing. Pigs in blankets during a breakup. We had to interrupt the crying to get them out of the oven. I really got the giggles at my friend’s dad’s funeral. Everyone was on their phone for the entire service. The priest was furious. There was a huge queue of people waiting to be blessed, so by the end he was just aggressively tapping people on the head, shouting: “We’re going to be late for the crem!” Annie McGrath curates the exhibition Art Is the Best Medicine, Fiumano Clase, WC1, to Friday 20 December.
