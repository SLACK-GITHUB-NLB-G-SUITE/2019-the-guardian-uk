For our second list of the best 100 female footballers in the world we have assembled a voting panel of 93 judges from 44 countries, led by the new US women’s national head coach Vlatko Andonovski and legends such as Sun Wen, Lotta Schelin, Aya Miyama and Anja Mittag. They are backed up by a selection of coaches, journalists and broadcasters, as well as the current Reign FC and Wales midfielder Jess Fishlock and Arsenal’s FA WSL-winning manager Joe Montemurro. The former internationals have thousands of international caps between them while the managers have won titles in England, USA and even a World Cup. Our 93 judges are drawn from around the world as follows: Africa 8, Asia 14, Europe 44, North and Central America 14, South America 12. The countdown begins on Tuesday 3 December with Nos 100-71. On Wednesday we will reveal Nos 70-41, on Thursday Nos 40-11 before the top 10 on Friday completes this year’s list. The Top 100 rules are explained beneath the list of judges.

creator of JWSports in Africa Suzanne Wrack Guardian women’s football writer • Our judges were sent a longlist of 450 footballers drawn from leagues on every continent and asked one simple question: who have been the best female players in the world in 2019? • We asked our judges to choose 40 names each, and rank their selection in order from 1-40, No 1 being their choice of the best female player in the world this year. • The No 1 choice of each judge was awarded 40pts, No 2 given 39pts, down to 1pt for their No 40 choice. All the votes were added together to give a raw score. • To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. • A player needed to receive votes from at least three judges to qualify for the list. • If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. • We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating in this project. • To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records are anonymised.
