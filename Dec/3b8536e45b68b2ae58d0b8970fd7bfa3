Spicy-sweet gingerbread biscuits are a Christmas classic. You should know by now that I like to mix things up, though, so this week I’m taking all the best parts of gingerbread and putting them into smooth, rich and delicate squares of fudge. They make the perfect Christmas gift, too. The fudge will keep for up to a week, stored in an airtight container at room temperature; or up to three weeks stored in the fridge. Prep 5 minChill OvernightCook 15 minMakes 64 pieces 1 x 397g can condensed milk500g white chocolate chips½ tsp vanilla bean paste or extract4 tbsp treacle2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp ground nutmeg ½ tsp ground mixed spice¼ tsp ground cloves Line a 20cm square baking tin with baking paper or clingfilm, leaving a slight overhang. Put the condensed milk and white chocolate in a large saucepan over a low-medium heat. Stir continuously, until the white chocolate has melted, then remove from the heat. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan, return to the heat and stir until smooth. Pour the mix into the prepared tin, cover with parchment or foil and pop in the fridge to set overnight. The next day, lift the fudge out of the tin and cut into bitesized squares.
