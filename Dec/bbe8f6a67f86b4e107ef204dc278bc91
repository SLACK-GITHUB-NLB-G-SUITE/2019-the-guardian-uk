This is a user-friendly adaptation of a cocktail on the list at City Social, which uses rather less widely accessible ingredients. It’s very Christmassy, easy to make and easier still to drink. Serves 1 70ml champagne – we use Moët & Chandon Imperial 25ml Pimm’s No120ml lager – we use Peroni 2 tsp cinnamon syrup – we use Monin1 orange slice, to garnish Pour everything in a mixing glass, stir gently twice (over-mixing will make the champagne and lager lose their bubbles), pour into a champagne flute, garnish and serve. • Catalin Ciont, bar manager, City Social, London EC2
