Chris Cantrill: Cancel all your plans and seek out the undisputed queen of character comedy, Anna Mann. Amy Gledhill: We got tickets to watch our spirit guides Vic and Bob last year recording Big Night Out and I haven’t washed since.

Chris: Probably my Insane Clown Posse T-shirt. Although it wasn’t funny when I bought it because I believed with every strand of my being that I was a disenfranchised Juggalo. Amy: I once had a dream that I was sharing a noodle box with Cat Deeley on the bus to my old school and then spookily enough … pretty much exactly a year on … I wrote this answer. Chris: Minus £2,376.82 – the real punchline to the Edinburgh comedy festival. Amy: Pimhole. Chris: We own the copyright but we are open to negotiations.
