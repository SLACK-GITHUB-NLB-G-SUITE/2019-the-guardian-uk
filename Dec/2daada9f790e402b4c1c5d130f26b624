Police are investigating the sudden death of a teaching assistant who was found dead at a house in south Wales. The body of the 31-year-old man, who has not been named, was found at a property in the Brackla area of Bridgend on Sunday morning. He worked at Ysgol Bryn Castell, which educates children with special needs. The school was closed for all pupils on Monday. There were reports the man had been struck with a chair in an incident involving a pupil last week. But a spokesperson for South Wales police said: “Officers in Bridgend are continuing to investigate the sudden death of a 31-year-old man who was found dead at a property in the Brackla area on Sunday morning. “Following the results of a postmortem carried out today by a Home Office pathologist officers there is no evidence to suggest an assault or injury. An inquest into the death will be held in due course. We request that the family is allowed privacy at this sad time.” Headteacher Helen Ridout posted a notice on the school’s website on Sunday reading: “Apologies, due to unforeseen circumstances, YBC is closed for all pupils on Monday 2 December 2019.” A council spokeswoman said: “Bridgend county borough council is aware of the death of a member of staff from Ysgol Bryn Castell over the weekend. Our thoughts are with the family of the member of staff at this difficult time. “Ysgol Bryn Castell school is currently closed and we’re unable to provide any further information.” A report in January 2019 by Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, rated the school as good. It described Ysgol Bryn Castell as a maintained special school for pupils aged seven to 19 with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties and a range of other needs including autistic spectrum disorder. At the time of the report, the school had 147 pupils.
