I am really sorry that Janice Gupta Gwilliam has resigned from her local Trussell Trust food bank (Letters, 14 December). I have been a volunteer in the north-west for around three years and, being in an area where universal credit has been rolled out, I have seen a huge rise in the number of people being referred to us. Following the re-election on Thursday of the government that has caused poverty and misery all over the country, I and many other volunteers know we are going to be needed more than ever. We need to, first of all, look after the people who come to us in despair. But also we need to hold our MPs to account. The Trussell Trust is non-political on the face of it, and probably should remain so. However, it commissioned an independent study last year called State of Hunger in which much of the blame for poverty is laid firmly at the door of the government. Please, Janice, think again. You are needed now more than ever.Trish CockayneLymm, Cheshire • As a food bank volunteer, I’d ask Janice Gupta Gwilliam to reconsider. The Trussell Trust is campaigning for an end to the five-week wait for universal credit. It also lobbies the government on behalf of food banks and their clients. By donating food and welcoming clients, communities show solidarity with fellow citizens whose lives are in crisis. The practical and emotional support that Janice and her fellow volunteers provide is complemented by the Trussell Trust speaking truth to power.Jeff SkinnerExeter • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
