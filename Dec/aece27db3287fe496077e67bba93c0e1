Freddie Ljungberg oversees his fifth game as Arsenal’s interim head coach and the scalp of Manchester City would present a compelling argument for him to be offered the role on a longer basis. He has a number of injury concerns though, with Granit Xhaka and Kieran Tierney among those missing out, and must hope Nicolas Pépé is fit to start after what may have been a breakthrough performance in Monday’s win at West Ham. City, bruised by their defeat in the Manchester derby, are vulnerable but Ljungberg may need Arsenal to hit a level they have barely reached this season.
