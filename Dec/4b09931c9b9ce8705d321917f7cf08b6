Silver Ferns shooting great Maria Folau has retired from all netball, ending her 150-cap career with a low-key farewell. A Netball New Zealand press release confirmed the 32-year-old had hung up her bib, having played her final Tests in the recent Constellation Cup series loss to Australia. Known for deadly shooting radar, particularly from distance, Folau became a regular fixture for the Silver Ferns and was a key figure when they pipped the Diamonds in the final of this year’s World Cup in Liverpool. That gold medal added to three world championship silvers and two Commonwealth Games golds. A hugely popular figure throughout her Test career, which began as an 18-year-old, Folau chose to withdraw from the limelight over the past two years because of the public furore surrounding her husband, former Wallabies rugby star Israel Folau. Supportive of her husband’s ardent religious beliefs and by his side throughout a legal battle with his former employers Rugby Australia, she became a source of some antagonism. She has given one interview to media this year – a brief television chat after the World Cup final. Even the press release on Tuesday didn’t feature any comment from the player. Silver Ferns coach Noeline Taurua said Folau will be remembered as one of New Zealand’s greatest players. “There is something special about watching Maria seamlessly land those long-range goals from any point in the shooting circle without a furrowed brow,” Taurua said. “You cannot consistently shoot like that, unless you are dedicated and committed to your craft. She will be long remembered for what she has brought to the game, and we will dearly miss her.” She finishes as the second most-capped Silver Fern in history behind Laura Langman.
