The reindeer is the emblematic Christmas animal and, while not exactly magical, it is among the best adapted to snowy conditions. For a start, a reindeer’s feet have four toes with dewclaws that spread out to distribute its weight like snowshoes, and are equipped with sharp hooves for digging in snow. A reindeer’s nose warms the air on its way to the lungs, cooling it again before it is exhaled. As well as retaining heat, this helps prevent water from being lost as vapour. This is why reindeer breath does not steam like human and horse breath. A reindeer’s thick double-layered coat is so efficient that it is more likely to overheat than get too cold, especially when running. When this happens, reindeer pant like dogs to cool down, bypassing the nasal heat exchanger. Snowfields may be featureless to human eyes, but reindeer are sensitive to ultraviolet light, an evolutionary development that only occurred after the animals moved to Arctic regions. Snow reflects ultraviolet, so this ultravision allows reindeer to spot anything lying on it, in particular lichen, which they eat, and traces of urine showing where other reindeer have passed. But while reindeer thrive in Christmas-card weather, they are increasingly challenged by climate change and the freeze-thaw conditions that produce poor grazing.
