I read the article on adoption (More children left in care as adoptions decline by a third, 6 December) with great interest. As a retired family panel magistrate, I have a sound working knowledge of the adoption process, having made care orders and approved adoptions. My daughter and her partner have applied to become adopters through the local authority. Throughout the initial process they been given the negative aspects of being adopters, with great emphasis on trauma and the problems of adopting older children. Of course there may be problems with a child who has been in care or has had poor initial parenting, but there are positive aspects that seem to be ignored. The process seems designed to present a one-sided approach, testing the resolve of potential adopters. It is no wonder that the number of potential adopters is falling. Social workers need to review their approach to ensure presentations are fair and balanced, presenting the positive and negative aspects of adoption.Name and address supplied
