Sir Michael Howard was a key founder member and lifelong supporter of the Council on Christian Approaches to Defence and Disarmament. Recognising that the churches, like the country, were bitterly divided between those who supported and those who opposed nuclear weapons, the CCADD created a forum for discussion at the highest level. Bringing together senior officials from the Ministry of Defence such as Sir Michael Quinlan, and leading quakers such as Sydney Bailey, together with academics, service personnel and members of peace groups, it did much to raise the level of debate. In addition to seminars, an annual international conference drew in similar figures from other Nato countries. CCADD continues the same role in todayâ€™s rather different but no less testing international context.
