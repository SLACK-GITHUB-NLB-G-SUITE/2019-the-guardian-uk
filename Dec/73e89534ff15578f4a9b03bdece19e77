A police chief in Alabama has apologised for an officer’s social media post which appeared to ridicule homeless people and was shared widely over the Christmas holidays. The Facebook post showed two officers from the city of Mobile holding what the post called a “homeless quilt” made of cardboard signs that apparently had been confiscated from panhandlers around the city, according to media outlet al.com. “Wanna wish everybody in the 4th precinct a Merry Christmas, especially our captain. Hope you enjoy our homeless quilt. Sincerely Panhandler patrol,” the post read. The city’s police chief, Lawrence Battiste, apologised for the post, calling it an “insensitive gesture”. “Although we do not condone panhandling and must enforce the city ordinances that limit panhandling, it is never our intent or desire as a police department to make light of those who find themselves in a homeless state,” Battiste said. Both officers are recent graduates of the Mobile Police Academy and the picture appears to have been taken inside a police department office, al.com reported. It was unclear if there would be an investigation or if the officers would face reprimand. Mobile has a ban on street begging. It stipulates that asking for money is only allowed outside of a downtown area popular with visitors. Panhandling in the restricted zone can result in a fine of up to $500, community service and up to six months in jail.
