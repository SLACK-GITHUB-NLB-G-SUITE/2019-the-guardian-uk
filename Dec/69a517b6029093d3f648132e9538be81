A refreshing little number that will do the trick nicely for New Year’s Eve. If you don’t want to make the sherbet, use a basic sugar syrup infused with grapefruit instead. Serves 1 For the grapefruit sherbet½ large pink grapefruit, zest grated and juiced50g caster sugar For the drink25ml blanco tequila140g lime sorbet5ml Velvet Falernum or orgeat syrup5ml grapefruit sherbet – see above40ml prosecco or cavaSalt, to garnish First make the sherbet. Put the grapefruit zest in a bowl with the sugar, stir to combine, then leave to infuse for half an hour. Add the grapefruit juice (you need 50ml, so add extra juice as necessary), stir to dissolve the sugar, then strain into a sterilised jar. The sherbet is now ready to use, and will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks. For the drink, put everything bar the salt in a blender and whizz until silky smooth. Pour into deep coupes and garnish with a liberal sprinkling of good-quality salt – we use pink Himalayan. • Liam Davy, Hawksmoor, London E1
