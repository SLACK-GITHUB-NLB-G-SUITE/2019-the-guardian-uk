To most people the article of greatest interest in the Royal Horticultural Society’s Journal will be Captain AW Hill’s description of the work done by the Imperial War Graves Commission in France. Captain Hill is a distinguished botanist and one of the officials of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, so that his position as adviser to the Commission gave the best guarantee that the horticultural work would be well directed. Photographs are reproduced of the burying grounds at Varennes, where the graves were not very far from the line when the photograph was taken in 1917; at Bailleul, where double trenches were sown with annuals bordered by grass; at Saint Sever, where grass is being sown and a rose-bush planted by each cross, while hedgerows will be beautiful with yews, Persian lilac, barberries, roses, &c.; at Forceville, where two-thirds of the grave area is grass and the remainder dwarf annuals; at Étaples, where a fine effect is got by maritime pines buttressing the blown sand, and the prevailing yellow of the soil is made beautiful by planting in blue, mauve, and white; and at Guerin, where the cemetery is in a beautiful apple orchard, and each separate grave is sown with annuals near the cross, the remainder being grass-covered.
