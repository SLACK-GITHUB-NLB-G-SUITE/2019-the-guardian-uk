I’m sure you are, like me, athrob with excitement at the prospect of unbridled munificence in the forthcoming season, with untold riches on offer from all directions. No, I’m not talking about the ruddy general election, but Christmas. I know it’s a time of goodwill to all men, but we must draw the line at that unpleasant migratory visitor, the part-timer drinker and his inexcusable abuse of the English language. In the past week, I, a hardened toper, have heard customers, unused to the etiquette of the taproom, offer the following - “I’ll take a pint of…”; “Give me a pint of…”; “I’ll get a pint of…”; “Gimme a pint of…” and “I’ll do a pint of…” OK, the last two were Americans and a more charitable type might give them more latitude but… The pained expressions of the bar staff faces clearly said: “No, could you please just say, ‘May I have a pint of…?’” Just so. Talking of etiquette reminds me of when I was playing golf in Canada and hooked up with a roadie for a local rock band. Good company, but rather short of temper, he grew increasingly frustrated by the tortoise-like play of the fourball in front. The eruption was worth the wait. “Show some fucking etiquette,” he bellowed down the fairway. A noble sentiment, but perhaps something of an own goal. On other matters sporting, rugby club Saracens have been handed a walloping fine and points deduction for financial irregularities. Their captain, Brad Barritt, was asked how the team would approach the rest of the season. “An old team-mate used to say, ‘How do you eat an elephant?’ The answer is, one piece at a time.” Blimey, these pachyderms in the room get everywhere. I only await one of the Christmas part-timers saying “I’ll do a trunk” and my Christmas will be complete. • Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist
