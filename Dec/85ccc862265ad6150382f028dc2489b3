Three members of the same family have died at a holiday resort on the Costa del Sol on Christmas Eve, the hotel’s owners have said. Unconfirmed reports on Tuesday evening suggested they were a father and his son and daughter. “Management at Club La Costa World resort would like to offer its heartfelt condolences to the family affected by the loss of three family members on 24 December 2019,” the resort’s managers said on Tuesday. “The guests were found unresponsive in one of the resort’s pools. First response teams and emergency services attended and administered first aid. “The management are assisting the authorities fully with their investigation into the deaths. We would like to thank our first response team and the emergency services for their quick and appropriate responses and our staff for the continuing support of the family at this difficult time.” According to the Daily Mirror, the nine-year-old daughter got into difficulties in the pool and her father and brother both jumped in to help her. The children’s mother reportedly raised the alarm. The resort is on the Spanish coast, about two miles to the south of Fuengirola and about 20 miles from Málaga. The destination is popular with British holidaymakers. Tanya Aamer, 23, who is from Birmingham and was staying at the resort, told the PA news agency she saw bodies covered in white sheets by the side of the pool. “The atmosphere as I was walking past is indescribable,” Aamer added. “Obviously we’ve never been in that situation before so we kind just began walking slowly in a slight state of confusion as to what we’re witnessing and eventually when we got to the bottom it was just silent, no talking or anything.” The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not yet responded to a request for comment.
