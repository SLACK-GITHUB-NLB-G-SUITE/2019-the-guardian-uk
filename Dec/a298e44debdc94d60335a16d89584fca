Mitchell Trubisky threw three touchdown passes and added another on the ground to lead the Chicago Bears to a 31-24 victory over the visiting Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night. Allen Robinson had two touchdown receptions, and Anthony Miller added one as the Bears (7-6) won for the fourth time in their past five games. Trubisky completed 23 of 31 passes for 244 yards and added 63 more on 10 rushes, though he did throw an interception. David Montgomery had a game-high 86 yards on 20 rushes before leaving with an apparent leg injury.

Dallas (6-7) still hold a half-game lead over the Philadelphia Eagles (5-7) in the NFC East. Chicago scored 24 consecutive points after Dallas began the game with a 17-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Ezekiel Elliottâ€™s two-yard run.
