Manchester City have the sizeable boost of Sergio Agüero and John Stones back in contention for the busy festive period after injuries. The champions entertain Leicester on Saturday in the first of five games in 15 days and Agüero and Stones, who each had thigh problems, should be available. “Sergio and John have trained,” Guardiola said. “They have two sessions. There are a lot of games to play. Yes, [it’s important] to have Agüero and all the other players back.” Agüero is City’s top scorer in the league with nine goals while Stones’s return means the manager will have a second frontline centre-back at his disposal, alongside Nicolás Otamendi. City face Wolves next Friday, Sheffield United two days later and Everton on New Year’s Day, before Port Vale’s visit on 4 January in the third round of the FA Cup. City are in third place with 35 points, four off Leicester and 14 behind the leaders, Liverpool. “The distance we have now can change in a few weeks,” Guardiola said. Guardiola is an admirer of Leicester. “They play so good on the counterattack,” he said. “They play so good in their positional game. They control all parts of the game. It is a fantastic team.”
