Next year will be the last year the UK remains a member of the EU. While we don’t know the details of the future relationship yet, British citizens will cease to be EU citizens with freedom of movement and other rights from December next year. We have already been speaking to British citizens living in Europe about their concerns as to what it might mean for them. If you live in the UK, what are the top things you would like to do in your last year as an EU citizen that you won’t be able to do otherwise? Work in a Paris restaurant? Apply for Erasmus? Take a trip on Interail? Move country? Apply for EU funding? Let us know your ideas from the trivial to the serious. You can get in touch by filling in the form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses and leave contact details if you can as one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
