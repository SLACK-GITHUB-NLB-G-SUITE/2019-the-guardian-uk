Cypriot police have recovered the ashes of a Swedish teenager after a man who said he accidentally stole the urn telephoned the family in Sweden, offering a tearful apology, and gave directions for its retrieval, the youth’s mother has said. Kinga Bednarz, whose son died in an accident several months ago, told the Associated Press she was “relieved and thankful” after the ordeal, saying her conversation with the alleged thief was an “emotional moment”. She said the man, who did not identify himself, insisted he had meant no harm to her or her family. The urn, inscribed with “Dennis 2000-2019”, was in one of three bags stolen last week from a rental car the family was using while on vacation on the east Mediterranean island. The bags were taken after thieves smashed the passenger side window. It is unclear whether the thief’s remorse extended to him returning about €200 (£170) in cash that the bags also contained. Bednarz, who is originally from Poland but has lived in Sweden for 13 years, said the man told her where the urn could be found. She notified police in Cyprus who tracked it down near a highway exit on the island’s southern coast. The family had parked at Governor’s Beach intending to scatter the ashes into the sea. Bednarz, who flew back to Sweden on Saturday, said she and her husband would return to Cyprus on Tuesday to collect the urn. The theft came to light after Bednarz asked local media to issue an appeal for information. Police have arrested three Cypriot nationals in connection with the theft: two men aged 33 and 43, and a 34-year-old woman. Police said they received a tipoff implicating the woman and the 33-year-old man, while the other man was suspected of helping them evade arrest.
