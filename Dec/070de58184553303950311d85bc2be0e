Peel 1 kg of sweet potatoes and roughly chop them. Put them into a medium to large saucepan with 1 litre of vegetable stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Thickly slice 250g of king oyster or large chestnut mushrooms. Melt 50g of butter in a shallow pan then add the mushrooms and sauté for a couple of minutes until golden on the underside. Turn with kitchen tongs and continue cooking until golden underneath, then season with 1 tsp of thyme leaves, and salt and black pepper. Transfer the sweet potatoes and their stock to a blender, or process with a stick blender, and reduce to a smooth, thick soup. Pour into bowls, then divide the mushrooms between them and serve. Enough for 4. Use a good, rich vegetable stock. If you can make your own – browning the vegetables first if you get the chance – then do so. If not be sure to use a good-quality commercial stock. If the soup is too thick, as is often the case with potato-based soups, then thin it down with a little more stock, beefing up the seasoning as you go. I like to finish the soup with a fine grating of horseradish or of salted ricotta. Failing that, a handful of fried onions, cooked until crisp and deep walnut brown. If mushrooms don’t work for you, fry a few slices of salami or mortadella cut into matchsticks. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
