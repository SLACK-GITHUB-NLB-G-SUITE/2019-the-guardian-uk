All the votes were added together to give a raw score. • To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score.• A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for the list. • If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. • The individual voting breakdown will be published when the full list has been revealed. • We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating in this project. • To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of scores. • Voters are identified only by their category and a number chosen at random. The judges’ numbers bear no relation whatsoever to the alphabetical list of judges’ names presented above.
