A German multi-millionaire is looking for friends to live with him on his NZ$8.5m estate, describing his property, which features a winery, horse stables and sea views, as “paradise”. Karl Reipen has been posting advertisements in local newspapers looking for 10 people to share in his communal-living dream. His property, Awakino estate, is located on the west coast of the North Island and was last valued at NZ$8.5m (US$5.6m). “They could live in houses by two persons and share a beautiful winery for social meetings and dining. If you are interested to live a life with a group of interesting people it can be a new life for you,” the advertisement says. “You can enjoy walking, fishing, shopping, kayaking, bird watching, swimming or looking at the nice animals.” Reipen says adults aged up to 70 can apply, and are also welcome to bring their own horses to the property. According to the local newspaper, the Taranaki Daily News, Reipen made his fortune selling canned iced coffee, and has substantial business and property interests in New Zealand, as well as internationally. His Awakino property was purchased prior to the Ardern government’s ban on foreign home buyers, but still required the sign-off of the Overseas Investment office, which consented to the sale as they said the businessman had the means and ability to transform the land, and care for it. In the advertisement, Reipen states that he has a background in “international business” but has always enjoyed working on farms in Germany. Building up Awakino had taken ten years of hard work, he says. “Now where everything is finished I would like to share the ‘paradise’ with nice people.” The property is located 90 minutes from any large towns or cities, and is wedged between the Tasman sea and the Awakino river.
