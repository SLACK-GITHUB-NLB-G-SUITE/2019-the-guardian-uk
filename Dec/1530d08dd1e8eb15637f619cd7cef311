Twenty-five witnesses are to be called in the prosecution of a former serviceman accused of two murders on Bloody Sunday. The case of Soldier F, who also faces five attempted murder charges in relation to the shootings in Derry on 30 January 1972, was heard before a district judge in Derry magistrates court. The veteran was not present for the short hearing on Wednesday. The ex-paratrooper’s barrister, Mark Mulholland QC, is to challenge any decision to send his client for trial. He confirmed that 25 witnesses were being lined up as part of the prosecution but said some of those may not necessarily be called. After the case Ciarán Shiels, the solicitor for the McKinney family and four wounded victims, said: “We have indicated to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) that we intend to challenge the anonymity order that has been granted to the soldier. “The position of the families is that there is a significant departure from the principles of open justice, that this defendant is being treated more favourably than other people charged with homicide and indeed murder.” The case was adjourned until 17 January.
