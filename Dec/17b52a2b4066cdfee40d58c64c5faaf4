With all the preparations and feasting that happens at this time of year, making an elaborate dessert might seem an impossible task. This no-bake recipe should be manageable, even if you’re short on time: there’s a simple base of biscuit crumbs and butter, and a filling that is cooked on the hob and then chilled. Perfect to free up more time for last-minute present wrapping. Prep 30 minRest 1 hrCook 20 minServes 10 For the biscuit base225g digestive biscuits50g melted butter For the orange cream400g orange juice50g lemon juiceZest of 1 orange, pared with a peeler2 whole star anise3 tbsp cornflour200g granulated sugar3 large egg yolks and 1 whole egg200g butter, cold, cut into cubes Start with the orange cream. Simmer the citrus juices, orange zest and star anise in a covered saucepan, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse for one hour. To make the base, blitz the biscuits to crumbs in a food processor, then stir through the melted butter. Press the mix into the base and sides of a 23cm cake or tart tin, then leave in the fridge to chill. Once the spices have infused, remove the star anise and zest, then add the cornflour and sugar. Stir over a medium heat, until the mixture starts to boil and thicken, then simmer for two minutes. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl, then pour in the orange mixture in a slow, thin stream, stirring quickly as you go. Return the lot to the pan and stir over a low-medium heat, until it starts to thicken again. Stir through the cold butter until melted, then pour on to the biscuit base and leave to chill in the fridge until set.
