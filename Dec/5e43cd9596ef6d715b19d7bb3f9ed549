Ronnie O’Sullivan caused a stir over his reluctance to shake hands before his Scottish Open match against James Cahill before comfortably progressing to the third round. O’Sullivan attempted to fist bump both his opponent and the referee, explaining his actions later when he said: “I’ll admit I’m a bit OCD with germs.” “I don’t open door handles, I always have tissues on door handles, I am a bit OCD like that,'” he told Eurosport after he dispatched 23-year-old Cahill. “I have got a bit of a germ thing. It’s easier to do that and I don’t get any germs.” O’Sullivan suffered a shock defeat by Cahill during last season’s World Championship, but took just over 30 minutes to secure a dominant whitewash. Misses from Cahill smoothed a path for O’Sullivan to take the first two frames, with the third following despite the five-time World Champion missing a black off the spot. The match was put to bed when O’Sullivan neatly claimed the fourth frame with a break of 86, averaging at 12 seconds a shot throughout the performance. “It didn’t feel like 12 seconds, it felt like 21 seconds,” he told Eurosport after the victory. “I felt like I was playing slower tonight, I came out and tried to play a little bit more conservative because I have been a bit too attacking I think. I just tried to rein it in a bit, so it meant I had to take a bit more time on my shots.”
