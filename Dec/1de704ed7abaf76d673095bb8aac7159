Richarlison is close to signing a new five-year contract with Everton despite interest from several suitors including Manchester United. Marcel Brands, Everton’s director of football, announced last week that a contract extension had been agreed in principle with the Brazil international and his representatives. The deal could be signed before Wednesday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield. The 22-year-old has just under four years remaining on the contract he signed when joining Everton from Watford for £40m in 2018, so the new deal is in effect a 12-month extension on improved terms. But given the interest in his services, and the poor results that have left manager Marco Silva under severe pressure, the agreement will come as a welcome breakthrough for Everton. Silva was instrumental in bringing the forward from Vicarage Road and remains close to the player. He believes a new deal for Richarlison offers the stability that Everton have lacked in recent years. The Everton manager said of interest in the Brazilian: “I believe it is not just Manchester United. I believe it is some more. As a club we have to keep our best players. Unfortunately we did not keep one of them in the summer [Idrissa Gana Gueye] but to keep growing and going in the right way we want our most important players, our best players, and we should keep all of them. Then we can keep growing. We don’t see other clubs who want to grow selling their best players. That is what we should do.”
