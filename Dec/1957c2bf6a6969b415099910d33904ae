Our political team are on hand to answer your questions about the election result and we will be posting their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30 and 1.30pm on Friday. Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will be answering your questions on Friday. She has been covering politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian she worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post’s political correspondent. She regularly contributes political commentary for the BBC, Sky News and national radio stations.
