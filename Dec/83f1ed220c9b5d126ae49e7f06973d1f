At least two dozen people died and 13 others were injured after a bus plunged into a ravine in Indonesia, police said. The bus carrying dozens of passengers careered into a 150-metre ravine in South Sumatra province just before midnight on Monday and ended up in a river, local police spokesman Dolly Gumara said. “It crashed into the concrete road barrier before plunging into the ravine. Some people are still trapped inside the bus,” Gumara said, adding no other vehicle was involved. Search and rescue teams have been deployed to look for victims, Gumara said, adding injured survivors were taken to hospital. The accident happened in a remote and steep area near the town of Pagar Alam, hampering the efforts to rescue the victims. The regional bus left Bengkulu province for Pagar Alam with only 27 passengers but some survivors told police there were around 50 people on board when the accident happened. “Some passengers were probably added along the way so there’s a possibility some more people are still missing in the river,” Gumara said. Traffic accidents are common in Indonesia, where vehicles are often old and poorly maintained and road rules regularly flouted. In September, at least 21 people died when a bus plunged into a ravine in West Java’s Sukabumi region.
