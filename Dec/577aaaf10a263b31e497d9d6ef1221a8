If the result of Thursday’s ballot goes the way Guardian readers will be fearing, it might be accounted for by this observation, in my grandmother’s copy of Little Dorrit, “He had a certain air of being a handsome man – which he was not; and a certain air of being a well-bred man – which he was not. It was mere swagger and challenge; but in this particular, as in many others, blustering assertion goes for proof, half over the world.”Alan PleydellTrowbridge, Wiltshire • I could vote for Tony Blair’s New Labour in 1997 knowing him to be less than perfect even then, and I did. I am sure others who feel the same about Jeremy Corbyn and Labour in 2019 can do the same now. It’s not and it wasn’t about one man, beard or otherwise, or even the party’s policies, great or not, but about ejecting the Tories from office and allowing the chance of a more hopeful future to develop.Keith FlettLondon • The most likely outcome of this election will be Brexit-supporting parties receiving a minority of votes while gaining a majority of seats. What price the will of the people then?Roy BoffySutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Although a Tory member who voted for Brexit and Boris Johnson in the leadership election, I shall be voting in Kensington today for the best candidate on offer – Labour’s Emma Dent Coad.Dominic ShelmerdineLondon • There is a moral hazard that Labour will lose the election because Corbyn is serious, honest, boring and principled while the Conservatives will win because Johnson is a bit of fun, the buffoon you wouldn’t mind having at a dinner party, and you can’t help liking him. A vote costs nothing yet is a potent thing. Use it, my friends – if you’re not in you can’t win.Alison HackettDun Laoghaire, Co Dublin, Ireland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
