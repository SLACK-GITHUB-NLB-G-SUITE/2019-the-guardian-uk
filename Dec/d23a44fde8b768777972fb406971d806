Caroline Davies (Can Tories hold on in seat where hope lies in a tin mine?, 5 December) rightly refers to the “iconic” song lyrics that appeared on the mine wall when South Crofty shut down: “Cornish lads are fishermen / Cornish lads are miners too / But when the fish and tin are gone / What are the Cornish boys to do?” In case anyone thought this was in any way an “old” or trad’ song, I and other proud Cornishmen sing it loud as the alternative Kernow anthem to Trelawney. It was written by the much-loved Roger Bryant who lives in Falmouth and is known throughout the folk world. Protest songs are alive and well in this troubled land of ours.Geoff Lakeman Buckland Monachorum, Devon • President Trump cancelled his press conference and flew home in a huff (Trump leaves Nato talks after ridicule from allies, 5 December), but surely those naughty world leaders who were overheard joking about him were just indulging in locker-room banter?Malcolm RiversIsleworth, Middlesex • Could one wish for a higher accolade than to be characterised as “very, very nasty” by Trump?David Cragg-JamesStonegrave, North Yorkshire • Never mind Dilyn the puppy (Letters, 4 December) – what’s happened to Larry the cat?
