Marriage Story, the divorce comedy-drama starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, has consolidated its position as strong Oscars frontrunner by picking up four wins at the Gothams, awards designed to reward independent film-making. Marriage Story won in all four categories it was nominated: best feature, best actor for Driver, best screenplay for writer-director Noah Baumbach, and the audience award. Johansson, however, was not nominated for best actress: the winner in that category was Awkwafina, the lead in China-set comedy drama The Farewell. American Factory, the first film project backed by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground production company, won best documentary. The Gothams are not always a reliable indicator of future awards-season success. In 2018, for example, rodeo drama The Rider defeated period comedy The Favourite, which would go on to earn multiple Oscar nominations, while best actress Oscar winner Olivia Colman was not nominated. However, it can indicate which films have momentum; past best feature winners include Moonlight in 2016, Spotlight in 2015 and Birdman in 2014, all of which went on to win the best picture Oscar.
