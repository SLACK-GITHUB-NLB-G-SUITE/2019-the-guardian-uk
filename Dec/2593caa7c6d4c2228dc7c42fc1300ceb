The Featherstone Rovers Ladies and England international rugby league forward Natalie Harrowell has died, aged 29. Harrowell won three caps for her country and was a key member of the Featherstone side that reached the 2017 Women’s Super League grand final, where they were beaten by Bradford. A statement from Rovers said: “Natalie, 29, was one of the longest-serving players in the team, and a leader both on and off the field, winning the club’s Woman of Steel award in 2019. “Natalie remained a devoted Hull FC supporter, but as a player she was Featherstone through and through, turning down many opportunities to play at other clubs. She was very passionate about women’s rugby league and growing the sport, especially getting more young girls involved having recently taken on a development role at Wakefield Trinity. Our thoughts and condolences are with Natalie’s young daughter Olivia and the rest of her family at this sad time.” FEATHERSTONE Rovers are left devastated by the tragic death of women’s player Natalie Harrowell, aged 29.Our thoughts and condolences are with Natalie’s family at this sad time pic.twitter.com/aFoTgE4QU7 Everyone at Hull FC is devastated to learn of the passing of Featherstone Rovers player and Black & White fan Natalie Harrowell.The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Natalie's family and friends. https://t.co/fPuU2uhIBi The RFL chief executive Ralph Rimmer added: “This is tragic news, and I know all involved in rugby league will join me in sending their deepest sympathy to Natalie’s family, friends and teammates.”
