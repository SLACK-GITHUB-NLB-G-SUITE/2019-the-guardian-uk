There are a few stages to this warming, festive cocktail, but there’s nothing remotely complicated about any of them. It’ll help blow away any post-Christmas party cobwebs instantly. Serves 1 For the ginger butter100g butter1 tbsp ginger juice For the hibiscus tea1 tbsp dried hibiscus flowers300ml boiling water For the drink50ml cider brandy or calvados5ml lemon juice20ml honey water – just mix equal parts honey and water30g ginger butter (see method)150ml hibiscus tea (see method)1 cinnamon stick and 1 long lemon twist, to garnish First make the flavoured butter. Beat the softened butter until it’s creamy, then gradually beat in the fresh ginger juice. Roll into a log in wet greaseproof paper, chill until firm, then re-wrap in clingfilm and chill again – the butter will now keep in the fridge for four to five days, or for up to three months in the freezer. To make the drink, put the hibiscus flowers in a jug, add the boiled water, infuse for four minutes, then strain into a tea pot. Put everything else in a tea cup or hot toddy glass, slowly pour on the hot tea, garnish and serve at once. • Luca Rapetti, bar manager, The Baptist Bar, L’Oscar
