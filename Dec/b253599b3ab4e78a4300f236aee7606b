England have yet to see the back of the illness that has blighted their tour of South Africa, with Dom Sibley the latest player to be struck down. The opening batsman becomes the 11th player to suffer sickness or flu-like symptoms since the squad landed in Johannesburg a fortnight ago, in addition to five members of the backroom team. England have tried their best to contain the bug during and before their first Test defeat in Centurion, placing individuals in isolation and arranging separate travel, but have been unable to stop its progress through the touring party. Chris Woakes, Jack Leach and Ollie Pope were all ruled out of contention for the series opener but have all improved sufficiently to be removed from quarantine. The captain, Joe Root, and Jos Buttler, both of whom fell ill during the match, are also feeling better. Sibley will travel to Cape Town with the rest of the squad and England must now be concerned that the remaining unaffected players are vulnerable. The second Test begins at Newlands on January 3.
