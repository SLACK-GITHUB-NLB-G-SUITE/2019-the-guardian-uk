As 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories. To do this, we’d like to hear from our readers to find out what you want to read in the Guardian next year. From the climate crisis to Brexit, help us set the priorities on our pages. Which issues should we be spotlighting, and which causes have we missed? Which voices need greater platforms, and which areas should we spend more time reporting on? Are there any topics you have particularly enjoyed reading about in the last year, and would like to see us continue to explore? For inspiration you can see what readers said last year. You can share your thoughts with us in the encrypted form below. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian. We’ll be featuring a selection in a forthcoming Guardian article, and will let you know if your response is one we would like to use. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
