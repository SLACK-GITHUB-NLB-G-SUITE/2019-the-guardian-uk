“If you’re a kid from Tunbridge Wells … where’s the music for you?” asks Sports Team frontman Alex Rice (G2, 27 December). At the much-loved Forum in Tunbridge Wells, of course – a converted public lavatory that was voted Britain’s best small venue by the NME in 2012. It has booked a distinguished list before they were famous, including Adele, Biffy Clyro, Coldplay, Ellie Goulding, Green Day, the Libertines, Mumford & Sons, Muse, Monster Truck, Daniel Russell, Oasis, Royal Blood, the Vaccines, We Are Scientists and Wolf Alice, over the last 25 years, and is still regularly packed to the door!Dariel FrancisTunbridge Wells, Kent • I enjoyed Peter Bradshaw’s review of Long Day’s Journey Into Night (G2, 27 December), but the film looked very different to me: rain more relentless than Blade Runner, paranoia more pointless than even David Lynch would dare, more leaky roofs than Tarkovsky at his dampest, and a 59-minute, single-take, 3D shot that was as technically brilliant as it was pointless. All told, a very long journey indeed.Brendan KellyDublin • One day, hopefully soon, you will write about the Women’s Institute without including the cliche “jam and Jerusalem” (WI sheds jam and Jerusalem image to woo younger women, 30 December). Could you make it a new year’s resolution?Janet MansfieldAspatria, Cumbria • The Boulevardier is one of my favourite pieces of light music. Composer, English; subject, French dandy. Presents a pretty pronunciation problem for pedants (Letters, 27 December).Steve MooreLeumeah, New South Wales, Australia • I realise I must now be officially old, as I found the King William’s College quiz in G2 on Christmas Eve was easier than the other quizzes.Rod LipscombeFaversham, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
