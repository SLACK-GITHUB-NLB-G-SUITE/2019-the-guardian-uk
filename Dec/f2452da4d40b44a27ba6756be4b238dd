Online and pop-up bookseller The Book People has gone into administration only a week before Christmas, putting almost 400 jobs at risk. The Godalming-based retailer, which was founded in 1988 by two book enthusiasts, Ted Smart and Seni Glaister, appointed advisers from PricewaterhouseCoopers as administrators on Tuesday. The administrators said there would be no immediate job losses and that Christmas orders already placed by customers would be fulfilled. The business makes 70% of its sales online, delivered from its warehouse in Bangor, Wales, and is thought to have suffered from heavy competition from Amazon. It also sells direct to schools and businesses, with pop-up shops in workplaces. It recently launched The Big Book Boost programme, which aimed to donate more than a million books to schools by 2022. Toby Underwood, joint administrator and a partner at PwC, said The Book People would continue to trade and no immediate redundancies were envisaged as a rapid sale of the business was explored. “The intention is to fulfil and deliver all customer orders received and accepted,” Underwood said. “I appreciate the obvious concerns that staff in particular will have as we move towards Christmas. While the administrators have funding to meet the payroll for December, the longer-term prospects for the business, staff, customers and suppliers will clearly be dependent upon whether a sale can be secured.” The business, which has been owned by the private equity firm Endless since 2014, made sales of £71.5m in 2017, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Profits tumbled to £1.1m from £6.2m a year before. The company had more than £33m of debts at the time. James Woolley, a partner at Endless, told Sky News, which first revealed The Book People’s troubles: “The well-documented challenges in the retail environment compounded by the strength of global online booksellers, has severely impacted operating cashflows over recent years.”
