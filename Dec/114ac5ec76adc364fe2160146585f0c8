An 18-year-old man has been charged with murder after the body of a 15-year-old boy was found in a country lane in Cheshire. The body of Alex Rodda was discovered on Friday morning in a lane in Ashley, near the Greater Manchester town of Hale. Matthew Mason, of Ollerton, near Knutsford in Cheshire, was arrested in Forton, Newport, a few hours later. He has now been charged with murder and possession of a bladed article in a public place. Mason has been remanded in custody and is to appear at Crewe magistrates court on Monday. In a joint statement, Alex’s family said: “Alex was a very loving, caring, kind, loyal and, most of all, trusting young boy. He loved life and made friends wherever he went. He will be sorely missed.” DCI Simon Blackwell, of Cheshire constabulary’s major crime directorate, said: “Our thoughts are with Alex’s family at this extremely difficult time. “They are currently being supported by specialist officers and we request for their privacy to be respected.”
