The NFL has suspended indefinitely Seahawks wide receiver Josh Gordon for violating league policies on performance enhancers and substances of abuse, leaving the career of one of the most gifted receivers in the game in balance. Gordon was reinstated by the NFL in August after he was handed an indefinite suspension in December 2018, missing the final three games of last season for violations of the leagueâ€™s substance abuse policy. A 2012 second-round draft pick by the Cleveland Browns, Gordon was also suspended for the first two games of the 2013 season for a substance abuse policy violation but still caught 87 passes for nine touchdowns and a league-leading 1,646 yards and was voted to the All-Pro team. He also missed the entirety of the 2015 and 2016 seasons, and has spoken of his struggles with addiction. The 28-year-old has been in and out of the league since his return in 2017, was released by New England earlier this season and signed with Seattle in November.
