In May this year, my husband bought me a pair of Sony in-ear headphones from one of the John Lewis stores in London. I soon discovered that they did not hold their charge, and then a week ago they stopped charging at all. We live near Tunbridge Wells, so took them back to this store. We could not find the receipt, but we had our credit card statement, showing the purchase, and all of the packaging with the barcodes and John Lewis labelling. However, the manager was very dismissive and said John Lewis does not accept statements as proof of purchase. I have quoted them the Gov.uk website on accepting returns and giving refunds which says proof could be a sales receipt or other evidence, such as a bank statement or packaging. But it won’t budge. Does it believe it is above the law?LH, Tunbridge Wells John Lewis is another company where we used to receive very few complaints but now, sadly, we get more. At least it moved quickly to put matters right. It has said you are correct and a credit card or bank statement can be used to verify a purchase. It apologised, offered a full refund, and is investigating how you were misinformed … on three different occasions. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
