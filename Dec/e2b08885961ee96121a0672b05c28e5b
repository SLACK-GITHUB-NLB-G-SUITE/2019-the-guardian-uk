Starters on Christmas Day need to be unfussy. Foods with a sour or bitter note are a great way to kickstart a meal: radicchio and radish pair here in pink and red technicolour, and are tempered by the sweetness of miso and honey. I will be using some dairy-free cheese for the vegans at the table – Kinda Co makes my favourite. Prep 20 minCook 20 minServes 4 300g radishes with their tops, larger ones halved6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 tbsp white miso1 tbsp honeyJuice and zest of 1 lemon1 red chilli, finely choppedFlaky sea salt and black pepper2 radicchio, each cut into 6 wedges To serve100g manchego (optional)1 handful parsley, leaves picked Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/gas 5 and put the radishes on a large oven tray in a single layer. Whisk the oil, miso, honey, lemon juice and zest, and the chopped chilli in a small bowl, then pour half of the dressing over the radishes with some salt and pepper, and toss everything together. Roast for 15 minutes, until the radishes are beginning to turn golden, then remove and turn the oven to a high grill setting. Mix the radicchio wedges with a little of the remaining miso dressing, then put under the grill for four to five minutes, until everything is slightly charred and tender. Serve on a large platter with the few remaining spoonfuls of dressing, shavings of manchego, the parsley leaves and some salt and pepper. I’d serve a light, lush, white bordeaux or other oaked sauvignon-semillon blend with this – try The Lane Gathering Sauvignon-Semillon 2016 (£20.95 Corney & Barrow, 13%) from the Adelaide Hills.
