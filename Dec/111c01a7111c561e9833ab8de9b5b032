Lisa Nandy (Labour faces a ‘hard road’ back to its heartlands, says Nandy, 21 December) claims the People’s Vote campaign gave the message that “you’re not people – you’re the wrong people…” She is being selective in her interpretation. I voted to remain in 2016 but have had to listen to endless repetitions by politicians and Brexiters of phrases such as “the will of the people”, “the people have spoken” etc, so I have also been denied my identity as one of “the people” and doubly so as a resident of Scotland, where we voted 62% to remain and have had our voice completely ignored and disregarded for the last three and a half years. The 2016 referendum was won by a slim margin following a leave campaign characterised by lying, cheating, outside interference, data manipulation and dark money. The People’s Vote campaign at least sought to resolve the divisions in the country by trying to secure another vote on the exit deal versus remain. Democracy is not a one-off event. Opinions have changed and facts have emerged since the referendum, and in the last general election the majority voted for parties supporting remain or a second referendum.Diana CairnsEdinburgh • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
