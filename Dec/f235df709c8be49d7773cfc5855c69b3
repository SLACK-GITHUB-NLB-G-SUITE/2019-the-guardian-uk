Mena Massoud, the Egyptian-Canadian actor who played Aladdin in the recent Disney live-action remake, has said he hasn’t had a single audition since its release. Massoud told the Daily Beast: “I’m kind of tired of staying quiet about it … I want people to know that it’s not always dandelions and roses when you’re doing something like Aladdin. ‘He must have made millions. He must be getting all these offers.’ It’s none of those things. I haven’t had a single audition since Aladdin came out.” Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie and co-starring Will Smith, was released in May and has just passed $1bn at the global box office. Massoud added: “It’s like, I’m sitting here being like, OK, Aladdin just hit $1 billion. Can I at least get an audition? I’m not expecting you to be like, here’s Batman! But can I just get in the room? Can you just give me a chance? So it’s not always what you think.” The actor ascribed the problem to his lack of experience in the industry, as well as the negative effects of starring in a family blockbuster. “I feel like I’m going to be overlooked and underestimated for a long time because I am a young actor. I’ve been doing this for 10 years, but to a lot of people, Aladdin’s the first thing they’ve seen me in. So I think I’m going to be viewed that way for a long time. I’m going to have to work at chipping away at that.” However, Massoud has been given a major role in the Hulu TV series, Reprisal, which he secured before Aladdin was released.
