Now that Labour is seeking not just a new leader but also a new direction, might it not be helpful for the party to sponsor and organise an Irish-style citizens’ assembly that would consider issues of vital importance, such as state ownership, inequality, electoral reform and public services? With a majority of randomly selected party members, but also a number of people from other parties or none, the assembly would provide a window for an exchange of ideas across party lines. Proceedings could be livestreamed. The assembly could issue recommendations that would feed into party conference decision-making and be made available to the public. Given the closed, cultish way so much policy appears to be decided, a procedure of this kind might let the public feel more engaged in the political process.Bernard BesserglikPantin, France • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
