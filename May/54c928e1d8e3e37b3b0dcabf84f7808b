This is the drink that keeps the feria dancing in Jerez, Spain, every spring – this year’s event kicks off today. It’s utterly scrumptious and showcases sherry at its heart. To turn this into a batch cocktail, follow the proportions of one part fino to two parts lemonade in a two-litre jug – though you’ll probably need to make another jug very quickly, because this stuff vanishes like music in the night. Serves 1 Ice cubes8-10 fresh mint leaves60ml fino sherry – Tio Pepe works a charm120ml lemonade, such as 7 Up or Sprite1 slice lemon, to garnish (optional) Fill a highball or collins glass with ice cubes and fresh mint, pour in the fino and top up with lemonade.
