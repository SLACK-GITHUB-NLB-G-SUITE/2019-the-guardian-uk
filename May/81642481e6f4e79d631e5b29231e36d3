The earliest family holidays Franck Bohbot remembers were in Alicante, in the south of Spain. The first thing he and his parents did was go to a big water park. “It was so much fun,” he recollects. “You’re surrounded by kids and teenagers you don’t know, with your family, and you’re all having fun at the same time. I have a big relationship with water parks – they bring up a lot of memories.” Originally from Paris, in 2013 the photographer moved to New York and five months ago to Los Angeles. Now 38, with two young daughters of his own, he is revisiting water parks in his nostalgic, dreamy series Forever Young. In it he documents the beaches, arcades and water parks of Seignosse in south-western France on the Bay of Biscay, where Bohbot and his family go every summer. “This part of France is wilder,” he says. “You have more waves, people can actually surf.” Inspired by the subdued work of the Italian photographer Luigi Ghirri, Bohbot turned his camera to his immediate surroundings. “I wanted to do this project because in the end it’s kind of an ordinary place: I like to see the work of photographers and artists that sublimates the places they have in front of them.” So he spent two days shooting the local water park. “From that day I remember this feeling of youth: when you just want to have fun, and you don’t think about anything else other than impressing your friends by going on the slide. The first time you go it can be a bit scary, but you want to achieve something: I really feel like the kids were proud of what they were doing, laughing with each other. There was real friendship there – and good vibrations.”
