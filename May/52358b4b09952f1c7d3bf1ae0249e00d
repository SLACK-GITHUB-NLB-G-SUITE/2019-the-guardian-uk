A man believed to be Joseph McCann, the suspect in three rapes in south-east England, has been taken into custody after a stand-off with police, according to reports. Late on Sunday night, the suspect was encircled by police, who had tracked him down to an isolated rural area in the market town of Congleton. According to the BBC and Sky News, the man was hiding in a tree on a country lane as police helicopters monitored the scene from above. A reporter for Sky said police had taken a man believed to be McCann into custody just before 3am. Cheshire police could not be reached for comment. Earlier, the Cheshire constabulary said trained negotiators talked to the man and a source with knowledge of the manhunt said: “He’s surrounded by officers, he won’t be going anywhere.” The BBC reported the suspect was in a tree on Smithy Lane just outside the town. McCann, 34, was being hunted on suspicion of the abduction and rape of three women in London and Watford last month. McCann was named last week by police in connection with the abduction and rape of two women who were plucked off the street in north London on the same day, 25 April. It subsequently emerged that he was also a suspect in the abduction and rape of a third woman who was attacked at knifepoint in Watford, Hertfordshire, on 21 April. A reward of £20,000 had been offered for McCann’s capture.
