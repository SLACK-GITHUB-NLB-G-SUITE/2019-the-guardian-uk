The education secretary is right that exams are “inherently stressful” – but for students taking a modern foreign language (MFL), the stress is disproportionate. They will have to sit excessively difficult exams and accept that their grade may well end up lower than their performance deserves. In a recent BBC survey, 76% of English schools reported that the perception of languages as “difficult” was the main reason behind the drop in pupils studying for MFL exams. Where’s the incentive to choose a language if you’re systematically made to feel rubbish at it? National bodies ranging from the British Academy to the all-party parliamentary group on modern languages have called for action to address the languages crisis. Meanwhile Ofqual is killing off the subject in schools and universities by ignoring the evidence. Exams that are in some cases more difficult than first-year university language exams; severe and unreliable grading; and assessment statistics that take inadequate account of native speaker participation – these have long been critical in driving demoralised learners and teachers out of the subject. French A-level entries in England have plummeted from 15,000 to 8,000 in a decade, German entries are now under 3,000, and university languages departments are struggling or closed. Having wrongly decided in November that all’s well with modern foreign language A-levels, Ofqual is now consulting about GCSEs – vital to the pipeline for A-levels, degrees and teacher training. This time, Ofqual must listen. We, the undersigned university teachers, call on Ofqual to urgently adjust grade boundaries and implement proper quality control for MFL exams. No rescue mission can otherwise stop learners voting with their feet.Prof Katrin Kohl Professor of German, University of OxfordProf Claire Gorrara Professor of French studies, Cardiff University, and chair of the University Council of Modern LanguagesRenata Albuquerque Widening participation manager (languages & community), Soas University of LondonProf Seán Allan Head of the School of Modern Languages, University of St AndrewsDr Inma Alvarez Doctorate in education programme leader, The Open UniversityBeatriz Arias Neira Language tutor in Spanish, University of BristolDr Rocio Baños-Piñero Associate professor in translation, UCLDr. Catarina Barceló Fouto Lecturer in Portuguese studies, King’s College LondonDr Ulrike Bavendiek Senior lecturer, University of LiverpoolDr Judith Beniston Associate professor in German, UCLDr Rosa Bercero Spanish instructor, University of OxfordProf Henk de Berg Professor of German, University of SheffieldDr Jaine Beswick Associate professor of linguistics, University of SouthamptonProf Stephanie Bird Professor of German studies, UCLDr Federico Bonaddio Reader in modern Spanish studies, King’s College LondonProf Guido Bonsaver Professor of Italian cultural history, University of OxfordDr Carole J.A.
