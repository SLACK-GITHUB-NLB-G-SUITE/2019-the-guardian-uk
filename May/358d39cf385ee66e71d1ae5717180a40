We met and became friends at uni, fell in love, got engaged, became lovers, and were married in our early 20s. We once read that sex had three facets: recreational, procreational and relational. We have explored all three; each supports the other two, and all have been the basis for our great love for each other. We have never felt the need for any enhancements or stimulants (apart from the occasional escape to the garden shed). For us, sex and making love are intrinsically linked. Three wonderful children, all in their 20s, have resulted from the procreational part of our sex life. We can still recall the enormity of making love with the very conscious intention of creating children. We know how fortunate we have been. We have been married for 30 years, and youthful quantity has given way to a mature quality. With the house to ourselves a lot of the time, we can enjoy making love with complete ease and at length during the daytime, an enhanced recreational aspect impossible when the children were at home. Sometimes things don’t quite work (tiredness, stress, the menopause, long-term medication) but this doesn’t bother either of us, and very soon we again experience something overwhelmingly wonderful. We thoroughly enjoy being naked together, snuggling after making love, chatting and drifting in and out of sleep. Thus our relationship supports our sex life and vice versa, and we look forward to the next 30 years together. We feel blessed.
