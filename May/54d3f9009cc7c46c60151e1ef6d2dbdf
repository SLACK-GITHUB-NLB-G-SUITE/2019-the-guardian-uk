Details of the new series of Black Mirror have been announced – and Fleabag fans will be thrilled. The fifth outing of Charlie Brooker’s award-winning dystopia show will star Andrew Scott, the priest and love interest from the second and final series of Fleabag. The trailer, released today, shows Scott playing a character incensed by a society that is perilously hooked on technology, who ends up going on a rampage that culminates in a shootout with police. Miley Cyrus will star as a purple-wigged pop star of the future in an episode that appears to be about fandom and the Alexa of tomorrow – a doll who also wears a purple wig, and who is described as ‘a poison’ infiltrating a young woman’s home. Avengers: Endgame star Anthony Mackie will appear in the third of the new episodes, about a man deeply unsatisfied with his domestic setup and seeking an outlet in tech. It will be the first full series of Black Mirror since 2017, though the standalone choose-your-own-adventure episode, Bandersnatch – in which viewers had to make decisions for the lead character about everything from which cereal to eat to whether to bludgeon his father to death – was the surprise TV hit of Christmas 2018. It was hailed by the Guardian’s TV critic, Lucy Mangan, as ‘a gamechanger’ and the birth of a new genre, but failed to win the 2019 Bafta award for Best Single Drama. Black Mirror will return on Netflix on 5 June.
