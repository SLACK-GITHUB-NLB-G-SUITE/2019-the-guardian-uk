Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has extended his contract at the French champions for another year until June 2021, despite a disappointing second half of the season. The German coach replaced Unai Emery on a two-year deal last summer and helped PSG successfully defend their league title this season. PSG made a brilliant start under Tuchel, the former Borussia Dortmund coach, by winning their first 14 league games. But the season deteriorated as the club went out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the third straight year and also failed to retain the two domestic cups. PSG lost at home in the League Cup quarter-finals to Guingamp, who were then relegated to the second division, and lost the French Cup final to Rennes on penalties despite leading 2-0 early on. Friday’s 3-1 loss away to Reims was PSG’s fifth defeat in the league. “I’m delighted to extend my contract and commitment to Paris Saint-Germain,” said Tuchel. “I’d like to thank the chairman [Nasser Al-Khelaifi] and the whole club for their trust in me and my staff. “This only reinforces my ambition to bring this team to the very top through hard work. I’m also very touched by the backing of our supporters, and I’m sure that the best is yet to come for our club.”
