The Champions League semi-finals left large swathes of Europe glued to their TV sets this week but there was plenty of interest across the Atlantic, particularly among America’s athletes. 👏🏾‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ AMAZING NIGHT FOR THE REDS. WOW‼️‼️ #YNWA❤️ https://t.co/n9tuwtaj8z One NBA superstar had a particular investment in Liverpool’s victory over Barcelona: LeBron James is a minority owner of the Anfield club. “AMAZING NIGHT FOR THE REDS. WOW,” wrote the LA Lakers All-Star, complete with a liberal helping of exclamation marks. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr took time out of the NBA champions’ playoff campaign to congratulate Liverpool: “YOU’LL NEVER WALK ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!,” he tweeted. Spurs also have a strong following among NFL and NBA players. NBA hall of famer Steve Nash is a lifelong Tottenham fan, something he inherited from his father. “It’s in my blood,” Nash said in an interview with the Tottenham website. “My dad grew up across the park from White Hart Lane, my granddad was also a Spurs fan and when you are born into that, it’s just a way of life.” .@SteveNash was in tears at full-time of Tottenham's win pic.twitter.com/ifEZEbinYR On Wednesday, Nash was working as a pundit for TNT’s coverage of Spurs’ victory over Ajax. Studio cameras captured him in tears at the final whistle as he said: “I’m too old to be crying over football.” These last two games have been UNBELIEVABLE.#ChampionsLeague Tottenham’s new stadium will host NFL games from next season, and the club have forged links with the league over the last few years. Harry Kane has developed friendships with NFL players such as Tom Brady and JJ Watt. On Thursday, Watt – a three-time defensive player of the year – tweeted his approval of the semi-finals. “These last two games have been UNBELIEVABLE,” he wrote.
