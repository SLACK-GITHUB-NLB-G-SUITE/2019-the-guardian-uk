Sarah Ditum’s article on Ian McEwan’s Machines Like Me (Looking to the future, Review, 20 April) covers a range of fiction that took a different approach to sci-fi, including works by Ursula K Le Guin and Margaret Atwood. Arguably the most salient treatment of emotional entanglements with non-human persons is Marge Piercy’s Body of Glass (1993), with tales of two parallel relationships, one with a golem in 16th-century Prague, the other with a robot in the 21st-century USA.Dr Felicia Hughes-FreelandChichester, West Sussex • Re odd subtitles (Letters, 1 May), I am reminded of the story of the French version of Sam Peckinpah’s Cross of Iron. After a lengthy battle sequence with no dialogue, someone sticks their head over the parapet and sees a column of armoured vehicles. “Tanks!” he cries. The subtitles rendered this as “Merci!”Paul DormerGuildford, Surrey • My father worked in Devonport dockyard, was in the merchant navy and became a draughtsman for the MoD (navy).
