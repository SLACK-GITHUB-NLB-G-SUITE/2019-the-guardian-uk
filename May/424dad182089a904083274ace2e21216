Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. The satnav in my car is out of date. I often find myself in areas where there are no maps and even leaving a shopping centre can result in a confusing trip home. Can I update it? Or should I just use Google Maps on my phone? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
