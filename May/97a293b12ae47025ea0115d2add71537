Uncapped Sussex batsman Phil Salt has been added to the England squad for Sunday’s Twenty20 international against Pakistan following Dawid Malan’s withdrawal. Malan suffered a muscular injury in his groin while batting during Friday’s nervy four-wicket victory over Ireland and has been ruled out of the trip to Cardiff. 22-year-old Salt replaces him in the 13-man group, joining county team-mates Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan. The batsman has just four half-centuries in his 35 short-form outings, but a career strike-rate of 151.50 hints at his talent. Salt was born in Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl, brought up for a time in Barbados and spent part of his winter turning out for Islamabad United in the Pakistan Super League. He has made one major hundred this season, striking 137 not out against Kent in the One-Day Cup. With Ben Duckett already waiting in the wings to replace Malan in the England line-up, Salt will likely act as cover but at least has a chance to experience the international set-up. He joins an ever wider cast of players from outside England’s provisional World Cup squad to be called upon in recent weeks. Just seven of those who travel to Sophia Gardens were named in last month’s preliminary 15, with a host of others rested or rotated, and Alex Hales dropped from the squad. Sunday’s T20 game is awkwardly crammed in to England’s buildup for a 50-over tournament, but Eoin Morgan’s side at least go into the game with a win under their belts. It might have been a different story in Malahide after England slipped to 66 for five in pursuit of Ireland’s 198. Debutant Ben Foakes saved the day, scoring a nerveless 61 not out in a match-winning stand with Tom Curran. Foakes was named man of the match, just as he had been on his Test bow in Galle last year. The Surrey wicketkeeper will have the chance to complete a rare hat-trick when he lines up at Sophia Gardens.
