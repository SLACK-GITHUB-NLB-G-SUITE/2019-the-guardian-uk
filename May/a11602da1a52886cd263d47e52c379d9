The Boston Red Sox manager, Alex Cora, will not be with his team on Thursday when they visit the White House to celebrate their victory in last year’s World Series. El Nuevo Dia said Cora has declined the invitation because Puerto Rico, where he was born, continues to struggle to recover from Hurricane Maria, which hit the island in September 2017. Last year, Cora criticized Donald Trump for his tweets downplaying the number of Puerto Ricans who died as a result of the natural disaster. Trump has also blamed the slow recovery on elected officials in Puerto Rico, taking particular aim at San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz by calling her “crazed and incompetent.” “Although the government of the United States has helped, there is still a long way to go, that is our reality,” Cora said in a statement to El Nuevo Dia. “I have continually used my voice so that we Puerto Ricans are not forgotten and my absence is not different. Therefore, at this moment, I do not feel comfortable celebrating in the White House.” Eleven Red Sox players already have said they will not visit the White House and meet Trump. They include Mookie Betts, David Price and pitcher Hector Velazquez, who told MassLive last month that the president “has said a lot of stuff about Mexico. I’d rather not offend” people in Mexico by going to the White House.
