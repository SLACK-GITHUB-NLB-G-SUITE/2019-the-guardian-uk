Russia’s Ilnur Zakarin powered to victory in the 13th stage of the Giro d’Italia, the first mountain test for the overall contenders, while favourites Primoz Roglic and Vincenzo Nibali finished together on Friday. A member of the day’s breakaway, Katusha’s Zakarin went solo in the final climb to beat Spain’s Mikel Nieve by 35 seconds and another Spaniard, Mikel Landa, by 1min 20sec, with Jan Polanc of Slovenia retaining the overall leader’s pink jersey. Roglic and Nibali crossed the line 2min 57sec off the pace after allowing several riders to come back into the reckoning. “The last climb was really hard, I did not have a lot of strength left,” said Zakarin, who now has ambitions for the general classification. “Now I can aim at a top five.” It was another bad day for Simon Yates as the Briton finished five minutes behind Zakarin after he had already lost considerable ground in last Sunday’s individual time-trial. Mitchelton Scott’s Yates cracked after Landa attacked early in the last climb, a 20.3km-climb up to Lake Serru, the Movistar rider benefiting from the help of several teammates. Another top contender, Colombian Miguel Ángel López, dropped out in the last ascent after suffering mechanical problems and reached the finish 4min 19sec down on Zakarin. Overall, Polanc leads Roglic by 2min 25sec, with Zakarin third, 2min 56sec off the pace. Dutchman Bauke Mollema is fourth, 3min 6sec behind Polanc, with double champion Nibali 4min 9sec down on the leader. Saturday’s 14th stage is a gruelling 131km mountain trek from Saint Vincent to Courmayeur featuring five categorised climbs.
