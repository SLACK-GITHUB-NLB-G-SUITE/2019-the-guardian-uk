The penultimate episode of Game of Thrones, The Bells, blew up, torched and incinerated all previous predictions of how the season will end. There’s just one episode to go – and a lot of mess to clear up – before we finally say goodbye to one of the biggest TV shows of all time. Out of all the plot holes and contentious character developments, there’s one major question left unanswered: who will sit on the Iron Throne? (Assuming it’s still standing.)
