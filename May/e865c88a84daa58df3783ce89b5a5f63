Robert Downey Jr reportedly earned roughly $75m for the 2018 blockbuster film Avengers: Infinity War, which grossed more than $2bn. Now he is expected to profit handsomely again for his current release, Avengers: Endgame. According to the Hollywood Reporter, “multiple knowledgable sources” say that Downey’s fee for Infinity War was “at least” $75m (£57.4m). Downey’s contract with Marvel is known to include substantial profit participation, or “back end” – commonly thought to be around 2.5% of his film’s profits. This amount is added to his base salary, estimated at a comparatively modest $10m. Downey is believed to have negotiated this unusual contract after the surprise success of his first Marvel film, Iron Man, released in 2008. Prior to Iron Man 2, Downey was signed to a six-film deal, raising his basic salary to $10m for each film but retaining the incentives. His appearances in Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming seem to be separate from the six-film deal, resulting in bigger salaries for each (including a rumoured $15m for three days’ work on Homecoming). However, the Hollywood Reporter’s figures are disputed by some. Business publication Verdict estimated that Downey’s earnings from Infinity War were around $20m, with a similar amount for Endgame. Downey Jr received $50m for the first Avengers movie, in 2012.
