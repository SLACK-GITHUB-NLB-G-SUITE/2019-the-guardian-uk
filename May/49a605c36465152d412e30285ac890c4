The St George Illawarra Dragons player Jack de Belin will face two new rape charges over the alleged assault of a teenager in Wollongong. The 27-year-old was charged with aggravated sexual assault after the alleged attack on a 19-year-old woman in a unit in the early hours of 9 December 2018. Police allege he had sexual intercourse with the woman without her consent, in circumstances of aggravation and in the company of his friend Callan Sinclair. De Belin pleaded not guilty to the rape in February but the New South Wales police confirmed he will be charged with two additional counts of aggravated sexual assault in company when he faces court on Wednesday. AAP understands the charges relate to the same victim during the same encounter on 9 December. The sexual assault offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail.
