Ahoy! Bobbing about in boats on a canal or river holiday often means a laid-back, leisurely break. There’s time to take in the scenery, watch the wildlife and keep your eye out for towns and attractions to visit, plus restaurants and watering holes to savour. We’d love to hear about your favourites. So, take the plunge and let us know the how and why of what you enjoyed while out on the the water. We’re looking for trips in and around Europe, so save your waterworld UK stories for another occasion, please. *Foghorn alert: no cruises this time, thank you!
