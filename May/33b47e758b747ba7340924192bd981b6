Reading the Seymour Nurse obituary (10 May) brought back many happy memories of how, as a Burnley schoolboy, I was privileged to watch Lancashire League cricket when the likes of Seymour Nurse, Wes Hall, Conrad Hunte, Collie Smith, Lance Gibbs and Charlie Griffith were all club professionals. These great West Indians brought such a high standard to league cricket and were the reason for my life-long love of the game.Chris HoldsworthBurnley, Lancashire • Derek Hall (Letters, 9 May) asks why concessionary bus passes only allow the purchase of single fares.
