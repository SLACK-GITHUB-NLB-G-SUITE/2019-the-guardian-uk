Immediate redemption awaits Too Darn Hot (3.35), who lost his unbeaten record but ran to a high level in the Dante, when asked to make up a lot of ground. Returning to a mile should help and he can land the Irish 2,000 Guineas at The Curragh, provided he can pick his way through a 14-strong field. On the face of it the Newmarket Guineas worked out well for Magna Grecia, when he was one of three to race against the stands’ rail. He might lack Too Darn Hot’s turn of foot. It will be interesting to see whether Phoenix Of Spain can build on what he did last year, when he was runner-up to both Too Darn Hot and Magna Grecia; he did look the type to do better again at three. 1.55 Goodwood Having joined Charlie Appleby for this year, The four-year-old Vintager achieved a career best when a close third in a Newmarket handicap last time, conceding lumps of weight to the first two. He is well up to scoring at Listed race level. 2.15 Haydock Excuses are available for Lucky Deal’s flop in the Chester Cup. He had previously looked progressive on a sound surface in marathon races. 2.30 Goodwood The only defeat in Flashcard’s career was when he was a running-on second in a valuable Irish sales race. He is fairly treated for this handicap debut. 2.50 Haydock Mark Johnston, who has won the Silver Bowl twice in the past six years, has another obvious chance with the progressive Oasis Prince, a winner over course and distance last time. 3.05 York Pilaster has probably achieved the most of the fillies in this Group Three but the unexposed potential lies with Enbihaar, having only her fifth start. She still looked raw in victory at Goodwood three weeks ago but is on the upgrade and this return to a longer trip will help. 3.25 Haydock On the pick of last year’s form Hello Youmzain would be a threat to Calyx but he disappointed last month. John Gosden’s favourite appears to have much more to offer. 3.45 York Five times a winner last year, Eeh Bah Gum can go in again, to judge from his fourth-place finish over this course and distance at the Dante meeting. That race, won by a more fancied stablemate, did not work out perfectly for him and he may come on again from what was only his second start of the year. 4.00 Haydock Charles Hill’s Battaash has not been wholly reliable but has won first time out in all three seasons, including in this race last year. A wind operation over the winter may have helped and he can turn around the French form with Mabs Cross.
