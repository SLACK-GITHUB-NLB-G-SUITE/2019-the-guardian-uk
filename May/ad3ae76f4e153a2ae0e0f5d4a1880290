Two Sicilian women have photobombed Italy’s anti-LGBT and far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, with a same-sex kiss. During an election rally in Caltanissetta, Gaia Parisi and Matilde Rizzo, approached Salvini, leader of the League party and deputy prime minister, for a selfie. But while Salvini was preparing to smile for the photo, the trap was set by the pair, who kissed in front of the camera. The kiss was a clear protest against Salvini, who recently endorsed the anti-LGBT, anti-feminist, and anti-abortion World Congress of Families (WCF), held in Verona in March. Salvini said his government would defend the rights of children to have “a mother and a father”. He added: “So long as I am minister, wombs for rent do not exist in practice – they are crimes.” In an interview with the Italian news website Giornalettismo, the women explained the idea of challenging Salvini with a same-sex kiss came from the minister’s decision to endorse the Verona congress.

Its three-day conference in Verona had the backing of the far-right League, a partner in Italy’s coalition government, and attracted Italian neo-fascist groups. It is not the first time Salvini has been trolled during a speech. Last February, a 15-year-old from Sardinia approached the minister, who enjoys posing for selfies with his supporters. As soon as the teenage boy found himself next to Salvini, he recorded a video-selfie querying the minister over allegations that the League stole €49m (£42m) from the Italian state. Salvini walked away.
