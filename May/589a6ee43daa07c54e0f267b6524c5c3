Prep 45 minCook 30 minServes 8 100g prunes, pitted200g unsalted butter, softened225g dark brown sugar2 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract100g 70% dark chocolate, melted100g buckwheat flour50g cocoa powder50g cornflour1 tsp gluten-free baking powder 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda Heat the oven to 170C (160C fan)/325F/gas 3½, and grease and line a 23cm springform cake tin. Put the prunes in a small bowl, pour over 100ml boiling water and leave to soak for 30 minutes. Put the butter, sugar and soaked prunes (including their liquid) into a food processor and blitz smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and blitz again until evenly combined (the mixture might look as if it has split, but this is normal). Pour in the melted chocolate and blitz once more until combined. Add the remaining dry ingredients and blitz for about 30 seconds, until the batter is smooth. Tip the batter into the prepared tin and smooth over the top with a spatula. Bake for 30 minutes, until set on top and just starting to brown: a metal skewer inserted into the centre of the cake should not come out clean. Simply leave to cool in the tin. This is just as good eaten warm for dessert with a dollop of creme fraiche and some berries as it is served by itself at room temperature. It will keep in an airtight tin for five days.

Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a handheld electric whisk until light, fluffy and almost doubled in size. Add the water and whisk again, until the mixture has loosened slightly. Stir in the dry ingredients until evenly combined, then fold in the whipped egg whites. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown on top and a metal skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a wire rack. To make the icing, mix the lemon juice and icing sugar in a small bowl. Once the cake is cool, drizzle with the icing and finish with a sprinkling of poppy seeds. It will keep in an airtight tin for up to three days.

Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl, and beat with a hand-held electric whisk until light, fluffy and almost doubled in size. Add the mashed banana and whisk again briefly, until evenly combined. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, baking powder, spices and salt. Gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter, until the mixture is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown on top and springy to the touch, or a metal skewer inserted into the centre of the loaf comes out clean. Tip the loaf out on to a wire rack to cool. Once cool, slice and enjoy as it is, or lightly toast and spread with butter. This will keep well in an airtight tin for up to three days, or it freezes well in slices.
