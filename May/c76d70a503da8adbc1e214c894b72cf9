The Observer Magazine issue of 18 April 1965 was a guide to London, introduced with a feature by Paul Mandel, an American. The thrust of the piece (‘A Love Letter to London’) is that its natives take it too much for granted and should get out and enjoy it more. London on foot, argues Mandel, is unlike any other city. He takes a one-mile stroll from Bloomsbury to his office near Fleet Street. ‘I walked past the oldest library in London, an office where Dickens once worked, and a gatehouse built in 1518… down Chancery Lane past the Public Records Office with its Domesday Book, its poignant note from Catherine Howard, and its confession by Guido Fawkes; past the Law Courts, where I watched a policeman stop traffic for the self-consciously stately passage of a bowler-hatted judge…’ He argues that what the urban theorist Jane Jacobs said had been lost in the dying cities of America – proper civic neighbourliness – is to be found in London, but warns: ‘Mind you, they are trying to wreck it… In Little Venice the spectre of a superhighway, stark against the sky like some vast paralysed snake, looms behind the canal and the placid houses.’ (Presumably he means the Westway.) As with many foreign visitors, Mandel bemoans the class silos that the British are stuck in. ‘How many of you have eaten a cockle or a winkle or a whelk? How many of you have gone to Billingsgate at 5am? There, in a Victorian shed, is all the noise and drive and delight of unrefined commerce.’ In retrospect, Mandel’s article reads as a broader lament for a fallen world in which people have lost interest in their immediate environment. ‘There are the miles to be made on the M1; the Costa Brava trip to fit in; the Spurs to cheer; the dim flickering of a cathode ray tube to stare at and study as if they were signals from another world.’
