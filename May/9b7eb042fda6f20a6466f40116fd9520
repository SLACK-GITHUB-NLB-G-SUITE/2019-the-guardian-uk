There was heartbreak for Plymouth on the final day in League One – relegated on goal difference after Stephen Humphrys netted a late winner for Southend against Sunderland. That strike lifted Southend away from danger and sparked scenes of joy at Roots Hall, while consigning Plymouth to League Two next season. It was a rollercoaster day at the foot of the table, ending with three teams on 50 points. AFC Wimbledon clung on for a point at Bradford, which meant that Argyle’s 3-2 win over Scunthorpe was not enough. Scunthorpe also return to League Two, while results elsewhere meant Walsall, who drew 0-0 at Shrewsbury, would have dropped whatever the outcome. Doncaster sealed the final play-off place with a 2-0 win over Coventry. Peterborough beat Burton 3-1, but finished seventh, a point behind Rovers. Luton beat Oxford 3-1 to seal the title, finishing three points clear of Barnsley, who lost 2-1 at Bristol Rovers. Charlton finished third via a 4-0 home win over Rotherham and Portsmouth fourth after a 1-1 draw against Accrington. Sunderland’s defeat confirmed them in fifth.
