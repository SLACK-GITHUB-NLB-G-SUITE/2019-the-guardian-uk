When Donald Trump makes his state visit to the UK next month he will bring his own version of a royal court, in the form of all his adult children and their spouses, according to US news reports. Neither Buckingham Palace nor the White House has confirmed the guest list for the state banquet dinner on 3 June, but ABC News reported the US president would be accompanied by his wife, Melania, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner – who both work in the White House – as well as his other daughter, Tiffany, his sons Donald Jr and Eric, and Eric’s wife, Lara. The New York Times’ White House correspondent, Maggie Haberman, tweeted that Trump’s visit would include his children who work in the White House and his other adult children. Donald Jr and Eric are executive vice-presidents of Trump’s property business, the Trump Organization. Donald Jr has been subpoenaed by the Senate to testify about his meeting with Russian representatives at the height of the presidential campaign in June 2016, to talk about supplying damaging information about his father’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. If they do join their father on the visit, the duo are likely to meet princes William and Harry. During the three-day visit Trump will meet Theresa May, if she is still in office, in what is likely to be an uncomfortable session. He has been a persistent critic of the prime minister, and an enthusiastic supporter of the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, and a hard UK exit from the European Union. The president is also expected to attend a ceremony at Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day before heading to Normandy, France, on 6 June for more commemorations.
