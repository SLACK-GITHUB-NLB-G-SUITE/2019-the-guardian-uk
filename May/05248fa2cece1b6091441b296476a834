I used Expedia to book a flight with Finnair. At the end of the payment page I noted a £21 “airline card fee” had been charged. I contacted Expedia and, after a six-week wait, it said it would refund the charge and raise it with the airline. I just wonder how much money is being collected from people who don’t notice, don’t realise it’s illegal, or don’t ask for it back? DM, London No wonder you’re wondering, because eight months previously you wrote to me to report the same experience. On that occasion you’d booked a BA flight via Expedia and been charged a £17.50 “airline card fee”. BA told me the charge had not been applied by them and Expedia also denied all knowledge, although it agreed to refund the sum. Since January 2018, traders and banks in the EU have been banned from adding surcharges to credit card payments, although corporate cards are exempted from the rule. You paid by a personal Mastercard. Again, Expedia insisted that it did not add the fee, although it agreed to refund it while it investigated. Finnair also denied that it charges a levy. Only later did it discover that your card had been wrongly classed as corporate. “We are investigating how it occurred and if this might have occurred elsewhere, but at the moment it seems that this was a fairly isolated case,” it said. It’s a worry that this has happened twice with your card, so I suggest you contact your bank to see if they can shed light on why. The rest of us should learn from your vigilance and check the details of transactions with care.
