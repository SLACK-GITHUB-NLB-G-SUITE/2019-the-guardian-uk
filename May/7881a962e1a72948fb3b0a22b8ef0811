Back in December I purchased a Samsung smart TV from the Currys website. It arrived promptly and I was happy with it. However, a few days later a JVC TV was also delivered to me. It was clearly meant for someone else. I contacted Currys and after some time they arranged for the item to be collected, but then, bizarrely, issued me a refund for the Samsung that I ordered and was keeping. Once again I contacted Currys, but try as I might, I cannot get this resolved due to issues with its payment system, poor customer service and incompetence. It has even sent me a slightly threatening letter asking me to call it but when I try to pay using my American Express card (the card used for the original online payment) it won’t accept it. I have wasted a lot of time and effort attempting to solve a mistake that is Currys’. Can you end this crazy situation?MD, London Aargh, you have to love Currys’ post-purchase customer service. While it has never set the bar particularly high, your letter was something of a new low given that you were trying to do the right thing and give the store your money. Happily a call to head office got the matter quickly resolved. Your payment has now been taken via your Amex and they have reduced it by £50 to say sorry for all the hassle.
