Great rides, a lovely setting, imaginative play areas, friendly staff … there are lots of ingredients that go into making a really good theme park. Whether it was high-tech or homespun, educational or adrenalin-pumping, we want to hear about it. We’d rather hear about smaller, less well-known parks – places perhaps with a historical resonance and a connection to their natural surroundings. But fun is paramount of course. Please include exact locations, and any tips on buying tickets, nearby accommodation, ways to reduce costs and websites. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including website and prices if any) in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.  If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here.
