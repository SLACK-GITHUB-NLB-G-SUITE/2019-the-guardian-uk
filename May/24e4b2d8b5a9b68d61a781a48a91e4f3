Waratahs and Wallabies hooker Tolu Latu has been stood down by his Super Rugby club until a court appearance for alleged drink driving. Latu will also be subject to a Rugby Australia code of conduct process, pending the outcome of his court appearance on 6 June. “I’m disappointed with my actions, because I recognise the seriousness of this situation,” Latu said. “I want to apologise to my teammates and New South Wales Rugby Union. I also want to apologise to the rugby community, I know that my actions do not reflect well on the game. “I take full responsibility for what has happened, and I will accept any potential sanctions from my court case. I also recognise I should have spoken to the coach earlier.” Reports in The Daily Telegraph on Saturday alleged Latu was found asleep behind the wheel of a car with a blood alcohol level of 0.135 last Thursday. Waratahs coach Daryl Gibson said on he wasn’t aware of the incident until the media outlet contacted him at “lunchtime” on Saturday, just hours before they were due to play the Queensland Reds in Brisbane. Latu came on midway through the second half and had a hand in several key moments as the visitors prevailed 40-32. On Monday he met with Rugby Australia’s Integrity Unit and the Rugby Union Players’ Association. “Tolu’s actions are a serious breach of the standards we set for the players, coaches and staff both on and off the field,” NSW Rugby Union CEO Andrew Hore said on Tuesday. “He is regretful of his actions and has taken full responsibility and NSW Waratahs will provide him with the necessary support and further education. “We expressed our disappointment in the manner which we were notified of this issue as we expect our players to be open and honest with our wider team.”
