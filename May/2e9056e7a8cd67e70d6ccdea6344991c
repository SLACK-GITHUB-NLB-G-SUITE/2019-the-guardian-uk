French police have arrested three people over an explosion in the heart of the city of Lyon last week that injured 13 people. According to Paris prosecutors, the suspected bomber is a 24-year-old Algerian citizen, who was arrested along with his mother and another Algerian friend. Police have also questioned the main suspect’s sister. The suspected bomber is an IT student previously unknown to police, Lyon’s mayor Gérard Collomb said. An investigation over “attempted murders linked to a terrorist organisation” was opened on Friday and police had been hunting for a man seen cycling near the scene of the crime wearing a green top, Bermuda shorts while carrying a dark rucksack. Police circulated photos of the suspect on Twitter, leading to several calls with information. The explosive device, filled with screws and ball bearings, was placed in front of a bakery near the corner of two crowded pedestrian streets in the historic centre of Lyon. Investigators recovered small screws, ball bearings and batteries along with a printed circuit and a remote-controlled trigger device. Fortunately officials later said the charge was relatively weak. Sources close to the investigation suspected the explosive was acetone peroxide, or Apex, a volatile compound used in a series of deadly Paris attacks on 13 November 2015. Thirteen people were wounded in the blast in Lyon – eight women, four men and a 10-year-old girl – of whom 11 needed hospital treatment. Although none of their injuries is believed to be life-threatening, authorities said some needed surgery to remove shrapnel. France has been on high alert following a wave of deadly jihadist terror attacks since 2015 which have killed more than 250 people. Islamic State has been behind many of the attacks in the country but no one has claimed responsibility for the Lyon blast.
