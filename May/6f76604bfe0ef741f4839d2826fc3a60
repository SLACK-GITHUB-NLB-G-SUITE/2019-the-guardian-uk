Theresa May backs the building of a new Holocaust centre outside parliament (May joins former PMs to back Holocaust memorial, 7 May) on the very day the Guardian’s front-page headline is about the “‘urgent threat’ from loss of Earth’s natural life”. Do politicians not get it? This threat is not only about the loss of rainforest. It’s also about the loss of green space where we live. Londoners are suffering from illegal levels of pollution, yet still another memorial bites into our precious green space. There are plenty of other alternative hard landscape locations in London where memorials could be built. Victoria Tower Gardens is a special area. It’s a quiet refuge near Parliament Square. It could be a beacon about climate change. Where is the imagination?
