The Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater has been banned from driving for 20 months and ordered to do 70 hours’ community service after admitting to drink-driving. Drinkwater, 29, was two and a half times over the legal limit when he crashed his Range Rover through a wall at about 12.30am on 8 April in Mere, Cheshire. Two female passengers were in the £125,000 car, which sustained £50,000-worth of damage. The former England midfielder got a graze on his forehead and gave a reading of 87 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes/100ml. He admitted to drink-driving at a hearing at Stockport magistrates court on Monday.
