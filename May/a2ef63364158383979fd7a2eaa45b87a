Huddersfield’s goalkeeper Jonas Lössl has signed a pre-contract agreement to join Everton on 1 July. Lössl, who made 31 Premier League appearances as Huddersfield were relegated from the top flight last season, has agreed a three-year deal and will move on a free transfer when his contract expires on 30 June. The Dane has one cap for his country and will act as back-up for Jordan Pickford although Maarten Stekelenburg remains under contract at Everton until 2020. Marco Silva, the manager, is keen to increase competition among his goalkeepers, with the 19-year-old João Virginia also impressing at academy level since his arrival from Arsenal. Lössl, 30, initially joined Huddersfield on loan from Mainz in 2017 before making the deal permanent last summer. He started his career with the Danish club FC Midtjylland and also spent two seasons in France with Guingamp.
