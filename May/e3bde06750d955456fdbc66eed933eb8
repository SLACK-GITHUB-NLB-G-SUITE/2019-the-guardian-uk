Southampton’s Nathan Redmond is the surprise name in Gareth Southgate’s initial England squad for the Nations League finals. The manager named a 27-man group in advance of June’s inaugural finals in Portugal, although he will need to cut the number to 23 by 27 May. Redmond, overlooked since winning his one England cap in March 2017, recently won the Player of the Year double at Southampton. The England captain Harry Kane has been selected by Southgate despite an ankle ligament injury which has kept him out since 9 April, and another Tottenham player, Harry Winks, has got the nod after groin surgery. There is no place for Ruben Loftus-Cheek after he sustained a nasty-looking ankle injury playing in a friendly for Chelsea on Wednesday but his fellow midfielders Declan Rice and James Ward-Prowse are involved again. Jesse Lingard and Joe Gomez return to the squad, while Luke Shaw and James Tarkowski are left out. Southgate said of Redmond: “I think he finished the season really well. I think the new manager [Ralph Hasenhüttl] has had a positive effect: a lot of pace, playing the high press and he has started to score more regularly.” The manager said Winks deserved a call-up and addressed Kane’s fitness: “That’s one of the unknowns. He’s working to be fit for the [Champions League] final. We are keeping that door open. We are going to look post-Champions League final. There is the physical aspect and emotional aspect of that final that we have to look at.” Southgate said changes could be made to the squad after 27 May on injury grounds.
