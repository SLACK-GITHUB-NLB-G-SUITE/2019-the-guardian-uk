Ashleigh Barty has received no French Open favours despite entering as the tournament’s eighth seed after being lumped in a stacked top quarter of the draw. The Queenslander will play American Jessica Pegula in the first round but faces the prospect of a round of 16 date with Serena Williams, with top seed Naomi Osaka a likely quarter-final opponent. Australian No 2 Ajla Tomljanovic has been handed a first round meeting with defending champion and third seed Simona Halep, while the unseeded Nick Kyrgios will play Britain’s Cameron Norrie. Barty, who withdrew from this week’s Strasbourg International to fully recover from an arm injury, will start a heavy favourite against Pegula before a second-round encounter with either Danielle Collins or Tatjana Maria. Bianca Andreescu, who is 22nd seed, or former world No 9 Andrea Petkovic shape as potential third round opponents. Williams knocked Barty out in a tight second round Roland Garros loss last year but has had minimal time on clay as she chases a record-equalling 24th grand slam title. Osaka has won the last two majors and completes a stacked top quarter of the draw.

Unseeded Kyrgios dodged a first-round meeting with a big gun, although Norrie is no slouch and riding a purple patch that has seen him move to a career-high 44. Australia’s top male Alex De Minaur will carry the 21st seed and favourite tag next to his name when he meets American Bradley Kahn, while exciting wildcard Alexei Popyrin plays fellow young gun Ugo Humbert. Kyrgios and John Millman are joined by Bernard Tomic – who plays American Taylor Fritz – in a top quarter headed by Novak Djokovic, who is aiming for a fourth-straight major victory for the second time and will play Hubert Hurkacz in the first round. A second round meeting with Sam Querrey is likely while Gilles Simon, Denis Shapovalov, Borna Coric and Fabio Fognini are all potential stumbling blocks before the quarter-finals. Meanwhile Brisbane favourite Millman has his work cut out against fifth seed Alexander Zverev – a potential third round clash Kyrgios the prize if both Australians survive. The in-form Jordan Thompson has an intriguing match-up with 18-year-old whiz and 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime while Matt Ebden plays wildcard Gregoire Barrere.
