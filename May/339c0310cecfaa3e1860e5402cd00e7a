Greg, 25I met Jessy at New York University and we really connected because we’re from the Cantonese region in China. We both love food and after class we’d go out to a restaurant and eat a stupid amount. We lost contact after university but then we bumped into each other on our way to work. I’d been living alone in a tiny studio that cost an obscene amount of money. As the New York rental market is so expensive, some people “flex” – a one-bed apartment is converted into a two‑bed by using the living room as a bedroom. I decided that I needed to flex some time ago, and when I reconnected with Jessy, I knew she was the one. We don’t really have to put up with each other much, as our schedules are so different. But I am so happy to flex with someone I know and like. Jessy, 27Greg’s not messy, which is a big plus for me. And I can complain to him when things go south in my life. He’s a good listener – although he doesn’t offer much advice, he always listens. Our flex is a bit makeshift: my bedroom was the living room and there’s a gap on top of my door. I’ve used a piece of cardboard to cover the gap to try and block out sound and smells from the kitchen. We share but still have our own space. This is very important for me as, at the end of the day I’m often tired and I don’t want much interaction. He’s very accepting of that. I’ve lived in a flex before and it can be hard – but it’s not with Greg. If I’ve had a bad day I can come home and vent to him: he’s like a hole in a tree I can scream into. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
