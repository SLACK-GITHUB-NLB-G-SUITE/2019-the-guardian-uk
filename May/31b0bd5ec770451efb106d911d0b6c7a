Johanna Konta came back from a set down to beat Sloane Stephens for arguably the best win of her career in the second round at the Italian Open. However, she must return to the court later on Thursday to face Venus Williams. After her match was delayed after a washout on Wednesday, the British No 1 took to the court and, despite opening a 4-0 lead, lost the first set 7-6 after a tiebreak in which she made too many errors at crucial times. She fought back to win the second set 6-4 after a more consistent display, showing improvements in her clay court technique. She then thumped Stephens in the third set, beating her 6-1 to see out a two-set victory. Konta’s only previous victory over a top-10 player on clay came against Roberta Vinci at the same venue three years ago. With play backed up following the rain on Wednesday, she is due to play a second match on Thursday, this time against Williams. Naomi Osaka comfortably beat Dominika Cibulkova 6-3, 6-3 in the first of her two matches on Thursday. Osaka is also due to play Mihaela Buzarnescu or Julia Görges for a spot in the quarterfinals. If she wins, she will retain her No 1 ranking.
