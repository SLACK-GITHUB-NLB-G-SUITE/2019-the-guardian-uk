Justin Gimelstob, who entered a no contest plea to a felony battery charge last week, says he is resigning his post as one of the three board representatives elected by the Association of Tennis Professionals player council. Last Halloween he attacked a former friend, Randall Kaplan, hitting him repeatedly in the head. Gimelstob says Kaplan insulted his father, who had recently died. He was sentenced to three years’ probation, 60 days’ community service and ordered to undergo anger-management sessions after his no contest plea. On Wednesday, Gimelstob told the New York Times his place on the council was no longer tenable. “I’m stepping down because my job is to work on the sport’s behalf and the players’ behalf, and in my situation I’ve become too much of a distraction and a liability,” Gimelstob told the Times. “I take responsibility for that, and I take responsibility for the mistakes I made Halloween night.” Gimelstob has also worked as a coach and commentator on the Tennis Channel. But it is his work on the ATP council that has had the biggest impact on the game. Several players, including Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka, said Gimelstob should step down after his no contest plea last week. “I don’t see how, with everything that has gone on, how it’s possible for him to remain in a position of authority or management at the ATP right now,” Murray told the Daily Telegraph. The American was close with Novak Djokovic and both men were opponents of Chris Kermode, the ATP chief executive who was unseated during the Indian Wells tournament in March. Kermode’s contract will not be renewed when it expires in November. Kermode’s future had divided many players on the ATP tour.
