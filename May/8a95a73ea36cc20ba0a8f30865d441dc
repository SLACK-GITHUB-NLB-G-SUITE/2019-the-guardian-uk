Ireland’s Rugby World Cup hopes have suffered a blow with the news that the flanker Sean O’Brien will miss the tournament in Japan with a hip injury, his club Leinster said on Sunday. Leinster announced on Sunday that O’Brien, who missed their Pro14 final victory over Glasgow, will undergo surgery and faces six months out. Dan Leavy, O’Brien’s back-row colleague for club and country, was ruled out of the tournament with a serious knee injury last month. O’Brien featured in Ireland’s last two World Cup campaigns and was likely to be one of the back-row options for the tournament in Leavy’s absence – despite struggling for form in this year’s disappointing Six Nations campaign. The 30-year-old will also miss the start of next season with his new club, London Irish. Ireland have at least been boosted by the return of another Leinster flanker, with Josh van der Flier making a quicker comeback from injury than expected, and featuring in the 18-15 win at Celtic Park. James Lowe hailed Leinster’s collective effort as they bounced back from losing the Champions Cup final to Saracens in Newcastle two weeks ago. “We were so desperate to come away with a trophy,” Lowe said. “It’s like Liverpool. If they don’t win a trophy they will see it as a bad team even though they’re such a good team. We learned a lot from Newcastle. We got stuck in fourth gear then, but the fact we were able close out and score tries against Glasgow was awesome.” Glasgow’s centre Peter Horne said the “gutting” defeat “just feels like another one that got away.” “We were right in the game, even at the death, but didn’t play quite as well as we have the last month. It’s just disappointing,” he added. “We only lost by three, even though we weren’t at our best and that shows we’re a different side to where we were 12 months ago. “In big games we’ve maybe flopped a wee bit in the past. Even though we weren’t playing well, we showed a bit of steel and made it difficult for them.”
