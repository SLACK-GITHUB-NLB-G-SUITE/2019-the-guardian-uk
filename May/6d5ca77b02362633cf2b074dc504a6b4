A British man has been rearrested by police investigating the deaths of a woman and her one-year-old daughter in Canada. Robert Leeming was taken back into custody after the bodies of Jasmine Lovett, 25, and her daughter Aliyah Sanderson were found in woodland west of Calgary on Monday. The mother and daughter’s family said their lives had been “devastated and our hearts are heavy” following the discovery. Leeming, who has lived in Canada for six years, earlier denied any involvement and said he was “traumatised” after becoming a prime murder suspect. The 34-year-old said he had been romantically involved with Lovett, who had been living with her daughter as a tenant at his home in the Cranston district of Calgary. The mother and daughter were last seen alive in Cranston on the evening of Tuesday, 16 April. Activity on Lovett’s bank accounts stopped on 18 April. Leeming was arrested a week later and released after being questioned. At the time police said the man they arrested remained the main suspect in the mother and daughter’s disappearance, which detectives were treating as homicide. Calgary police said on Monday: “At approximately 4am today we located the bodies of a woman and child, believed to be that of Jasmine Lovett and Aliyah Sanderson, in Kananaskis. “A suspect has been taken into custody and charges are pending. The suspect cannot be named by police until charges are officially laid by the Justice of the Peace. “However, police can confirm the suspect is the same man who was taken into custody two weeks ago.”
