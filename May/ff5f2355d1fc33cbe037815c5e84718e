Bolton Wanderers will start next season in League One with a 12-point deduction after going into administration, the EFL has announced. The club said they would enter administration last week after the collapse of a proposed takeover by Laurence Bassini, and the adjournment of a winding-up order at a court hearing. Wanderers, who owe more than £1m to HMRC, confirmed on Monday that they have now appointed administrators. Bolton will begin next season 12 points adrift in the third tier – and in danger of dropping into the fourth tier for only the second season in their history. “The EFL can confirm that it has been formally notified that administrators have been appointed in respect of Bolton Wanderers Football Club,” a statement said. “As a result, the club is now subject to a 12-point deduction and the sporting sanction will take effect next season in League One. The EFL will now commence discussions with the administrators with the aim of achieving a long-term future for the club.” Champions: Manchester CityChampions League: Liverpool, Chelsea, TottenhamEuropa League*: Arsenal, Man UtdRelegated: Cardiff, Fulham, Huddersfield *Arsenal will qualify for CL if they win EL final; Watford will qualify for EL if they win FA Cup, otherwise Wolves will take final place Champions: Norwich CityPromoted: Sheffield UnitedPlay-offs: Leeds, West Brom, Aston Villa, DerbyRelegated: Rotherham, Bolton, Ipswich Champions: Luton TownPromoted: BarnsleyPlay-offs: Charlton, Portsmouth, Sunderland, DoncasterRelegated: Plymouth, Walsall, Scunthorpe, Bradford City Champions: Lincoln CityPromoted: Bury, MK DonsPlay-off final: Forest Green or Tranmere v NewportRelegated: Notts County, YeovilPromoted from National League: Leyton Orient, Salford City Champions: CelticEuropa League: Rangers, plus Kilmarnock or AberdeenRelegated: DundeePlay-offs: Dundee Utd, Inverness, St Mirren/Hamilton  The club’s chairman, Ken Anderson, claimed last week he had been left with no choice other than to place the club in administration, after the former Watford owner Bassini failed to provide proof of funding. Paul Appleton and Asher Miller of David Rubin and Partners have now been announced as joint administrators in a statement on the club website. “The decision was finally made for the appointments which it is hoped will ensure the continued existence of the club,” the statement said. “It has got to the stage where [we] could not sit back and allow the club to go into liquidation. Decisive action had to be taken.” “This has obviously been a long-running situation and it is vitally important that we quickly establish the position of both the football club and the holding company,” Appleton said. “Everybody at the club, as well as the supporters, need a sense of clarity and that is what I will be seeking to provide as quickly as possible.” Wanderers faced a winding-up petition on 3 April over an unpaid tax bill but the case has now been adjourned twice. It is the sixth time in the last 18 months that Bolton have faced a winding-up order. The cash-strapped club were unable to fulfil their final home league game of the season against Brentford after the players went on strike in protest at unpaid wages. Brentford were awarded three points on the basis of a 1-0 win, with the EFL opening disciplinary proceedings against Bolton afterwards.
