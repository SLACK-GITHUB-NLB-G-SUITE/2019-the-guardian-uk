Debbie Harry, who became an icon as the frontwoman of Blondie, has announced her first autobiography. Face It will recount Blondie’s rise in New York, when the band drew together the three great music styles of the city in the late 1970s – punk, disco and rap – into their own brand of supremely successful pop. A mix of Harry-penned essays and interviews with journalist Sylvie Simmons, Face It will also feature unseen photos alongside art from fans. “I didn’t want to [write it], but I did,” said Harry. “There are many more stories for me to tell, some funny, some scary, some warm, some chill to the bone, and if Face It appeals to people then I will get to telling more of the anecdotal bits of the story of Blondie – like the time I met Rita Hayworth and Penny Singleton backstage at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles … I have led a very full life and couldn’t possibly cover everything in just one volume.” She added: “I’m prepared for the best and the worst comments, much like when I have released an album or done a big show. I don’t have a thick skin, but I do have a pretty good sense of humour.” Blondie released the album Pollinator in 2017 and are preparing to tour with Elvis Costello across North America this summer. Harper Collins will publish Face It on 1 October.
