Alastair Campbell’s expulsion from Labour is a disgrace and confirms the decline of the party, under Jeremy Corbyn, towards a narrow-based, leftist elite party that cannot tolerate dissent. I recall when, as director of the London Labour party and agent for Frank Dobson in the 2000 mayoral election, thousands of Labour members openly campaigned and voted for Ken Livingstone, against the party’s official candidate. There was some pressure for discipline against them, but I firmly resisted this and at no time was there any desire from the party leadership to pursue it. Far better to heal divisions, learn from the experience and move forwards to a united, broad-based party in which all who want to see a Labour victory will feel comfortable. What a far cry from this latest act of dogmatic spite. Hardly a “gentler” style of politics!David WilkinsonSwaby, Lincolnshire • The expulsion of Alastair Campbell is for me, a Labour member for more than 40 years, a Spartacus moment. I also voted Lib Dem and urge all other members of the party who did the same to take one pace forward.John RunecklesLondon • Having been a Labour member for more than 30 years, and chair of a local branch, I voted Liberal Democrat in the EU elections. I’m waiting for my expulsion letter.Glyn ReedHaconby, Lincolnshire • Alastair Campbell’s dismissal is my last straw. Today I have cancelled my Labour membership of 55 years, since I too committed the same offence and thus I must share his punishment. May I add that I am no relation.Mary CampbellWest Byfleet, Surrey • I voted Green.
