Yaz doesn’t want to work in a nail bar for the rest of her life, wishing to get away from “shit jobs in shit towns”. Nate is a flash 32-year-old coming towards the end of his football career. His younger teammate Josh’s dreams of stardom are possibly over before they’ve even begun. Lose Yourself, Katherine Chandler’s striking new play, is about a night out in Cardiff where the desires of all three collide. The production is infected by the characters’ hedonism, always at risk of wheeling out of control. Directed by Patricia Logue, it starts slowly, with an easy swagger. On Carla Goodman’s stage of squares and steps, and bathed in Andy Pike’s occasionally encroaching lighting, scenes are aggressively punctuated and then begin to blur with the burning nausea of too many tequila shots. Performed as three interwoven monologues – with Aaron Anthony’s Nate, Tim Preston’s Josh and, in particular, Gabrielle Creevy’s Yaz all excellent – individual moments are recounted from singular perspectives. Language affords power. For Yaz, it is fearlessly emancipatory. In Nate’s mouth, the bantz are toxic. Josh recounts his horrors with the detachment of pornography. Confounding expectations at every turn, Lose Yourself toys with its own cliches. We know what is going to happen, yet when it does it is still a gut punch – and a shameful indictment of the fact that sexual violence was ever allowed to become a cliche. The monologue has of late been much used in Welsh theatre (particularly Welsh-language theatre), with mixed results. But as testament to Chandler’s writing, here it carries a startling and devastating potency. At the Sherman, Cardiff, until 25 May.
