I had to send my laptop to the Dell repair centre in Germany. Dell sent me a prepaid postage label and instructed me to take it to a UPS drop-off point. I did so, but UPS could not provide a receipt so I did not risk sending it. Dell has since confirmed in emails that not all UPS access points provide proof of drop-off but that parcels can be tracked online. Tracking a parcel once it is under way is not a substitute for a receipt. Dell then offered to send a UPS courier to collect the parcel but UPS told me the courier could not issue a receipt, either. Dell refuses to pay for an alternative courier and says UPS will be liable if the parcel is lost, but how do I know they would accept responsibility if I can’t show evidence that I gave it to them?JZ, London Both Dell and UPS told me that, contrary to the information you were given, UPS does provide electronic receipts when requested, and paper receipts in certain circumstances. “We are investigating why this individual was provided with incorrect information and we are looking into how UPS can prevent future confusion for our customers,” it says. This would be more reassuring if we had not been here before. A year ago, ML of Southampton reported that he had been refused a receipt at two different UPS access points and told to wait for online tracking updates as proof of drop off. Despite an email from UPS confirming that receipts are no longer issued, UPS insisted to the Observer that ML was wrongly advised and that it would investigate.
