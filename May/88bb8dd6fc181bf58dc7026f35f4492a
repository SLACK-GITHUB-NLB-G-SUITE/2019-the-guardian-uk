Souffles have an unfair reputation for being the stuff of kitchen nightmares when they are, in fact, pretty simple. The basic recipe for a sweet souffle is essentially a custard into which you fold a foam of whisked egg whites and then bake: it’s a step up from beans on toast, but hardly something to be pulling your hair out over. They make a fantastic dinner party dessert, being quick to prepare, and come with a hint of spectacle – the countdown as they start to sink once you take them out of the oven. If you’re using fresh passion fruit, run the pulp through a food processor with the blunt, plastic blade attached, then pass it through a sieve to separate the juice from the seeds. I tend to use the passion fruit puree for cocktails, and freeze the rest in ice cube trays for next time. Prep 10 minCook 15 minMakes 4 2 tbsp cornflour100g caster sugar160ml passion fruit juice4 medium eggs Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/ 425F/gas 7. Put the cornflour and half the sugar in a small saucepan set over a medium heat. Gradually stir in the passion fruit juice a little at a time and heat for a few minutes, until it thickens. Separate the eggs, putting the whites in a large, clean bowl. Quickly beat the egg yolks into the passion fruit mix, stir over a medium heat for another minute, then set aside to cool. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then sprinkle over the remaining sugar and whisk again, until stiff peaks form. Stir a third of the whites into the passion fruit mix to loosen it, then fold in another third, followed by the last third, making sure to retain as much air as possible. Transfer to four deep-sided ramekins, and bake for 12 minutes, until risen. Serve immediately.
