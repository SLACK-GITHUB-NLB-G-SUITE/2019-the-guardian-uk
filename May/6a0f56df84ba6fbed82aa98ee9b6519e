In 1996 Bibi Andersson published her autobiography Ett Ögonblick (A Moment), in which she reminisced about Ingmar Bergman and the other men in her life. However, but the last third of the book is taken up with her involvement in the humanitarian aid project Open Road – Sarajevo. There are some gripping accounts of her trips to wartorn Bosnia and her work with theatre groups there. I recently translated this book, as a labour of love, and found that it presented a fascinating picture.
