No surprises at the 4NCL, then. Guildford maintained their stranglehold on the Four Nations Chess League by winning all 11 matches in the current season and taking their record unbeaten run to 75 wins and two draws spread over more than six years. The Surrey club win many matches by 7-1 or more, and even single defeats are rare. This season its players lost just one game out of 88, when the former British champion Jonathan Hawkins scored for Cheddleton against Laurent Fressinet. Guildford’s backbone is a mix of English and French Olympiad grandmasters whose long experience gives them an edge in team strategy, as was demonstrated in last weekend’s final round. The ambitious challenger was Chess.com Manx Liberty, which has benefited from the Isle of Man’s chess boom and whose nucleus of Romanian GMs played for Trier before that team fell out with the Bundesliga and made the drastic decision to switch leagues and countries. Manx’s formidable wildcard for the final May Day weekend rounds was Richard Rapport, the Hungarian No 1 and world No 25, who is already a byword for imaginative attacking play. Rapport’s sharp style might have caused problems to his expected opponent Michael Adams, but Guildford switched their first and second boards so that Rapport met Matthew Sadler, co-author of an acclaimed book on AlphaZero. Sadler parked the bus, kept the position closed, and even launched counterplay on the a file which soon persuaded the elite GM to halve out. The match score reached 2-2 with four draws, but then went to 6-2 as Guildford’s higher rated players ground out the points. Luke McShane, gold medallist for England at the World Teams, was the last to finish in a 102-move marathon. Later this year Chess.com and the Isle of Man will host the 100-player Fide Open which will revive the tradition of the old interzonal tournaments and will qualify its winner for the 2020 candidates. Will there also be funds to strengthen the Manx team further in a bid to break Guildford’s monopoly? The answer will probably only be known in the autumn when the 4NCL publishes its 2019-20 season player registrations. The final weekend was also Hou Yifan’s Guildford debut. Since starting her Rhodes Scholarship education course at St Hilda’s, Oxford, the world No 1 woman’s only previous competitive game was a draw in the annual match against Cambridge. Her opponent then, Matthew Wadsworth, scored his first GM norm in the 4NCL season. Hou declined her invitation to next month’s eight-player women’s candidates in Kazan, Russia, where she would have been favourite to qualify for a world title match with a much boosted prize fund against her compatriot and world No 2, Ju Wenjun. She made two quick draws at the 4NCL, and her single win was with a well-tested technique used by strong players of probing in an even position until the weaker opponent blunders. The mistake duly came, and Hou pounced with a winning sacrifice. Gawain Jones, who recently took over from Adams as the England No 1, was absent from Guildford’s team because of a clash with the Stockholm elite GM tournament which ended on Thursday. The 31-year-old Yorkshireman was in fine form and scored a career best result, an unbeaten 5/7 for outright first, half a point ahead of the top seeded Indian No 2, Pentala Harikrishna. Cheddleton and White Rose are consistently in the 4NCL top half and they finished third and fourth behind Guildford and Manx. At the other end of the table, the newly promoted all-Scottish Alba team were relegated, last of 16. One of Alba’s replacements in 2019-20 will be Dublin-based Gonzaga, the first all-Ireland based team to play in the 4NCL. Gonzaga squeaked into the fourth and final promotion place, and the prognosis for their championship debut is pessimistic. Alba and Gonzaga have the same basic problem. Their teams are expert level with a sprinkling of international masters, but this is inadequate for consistent survival in the top division. Their situation would be far more hopeful, and would also boost the 4NCL as a truly national league, if Alba and Gonzaga could recruit more of the best GMs and IMs from their countries. As it is, the Fide-rated No 1 players for both Scotland and Ireland already compete in the 4NCL top division-but both represent a rival team, Barbican. For her 4NCL debut, Hou Yifan chose a quiet opening where White has a space advantage against Black’s bishop pair. The game was more or less level for a while, with White probing and switching her formation while Black tried to defend actively within the limitations of his cramped position. Hou avoided the tempting but unclear 22 Nd5?! and was rewarded for her patient strategy when Black chose the passive 23…Bf8?! rather than 23…Qg5!? The squeeze intensified with the rook lift 27 Re3 and then 28 a5 fixing the Q-side, and Black caved in with the blunder 28…Nc6?? (Rbc8 or Qe7 were only slightly worse) after which 29 Nf5! was immediately winning because of 29...exf5 30 exf5 Qc7 31 Bxg7! Bxg7 32 f6 and Black gets mated. 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 Nc6 5 Bb5 Bd7 6 Qd3 Nf6 7 c4 e6 8 Nc3 Be7 9 O-O a6 10 Bxc6 Bxc6 11 Nd4 O-O 12 b3 Qa5 13 Bb2 Rfd8 14 Rfe1 Be8 15 a4 Nd7 16 Rad1 Rac8 17 Qg3 Qg5 18 Qh3 Ne5 19 Ba3 Nc6 20 Nde2 Qa5 21 Nf4 Qb6 22 Nce2 Qa5 23 Bb2 Bf8?! 24 Qg3 Ne5 25 Bc3 Qc7 26 Nd4 Qe7 27 Re3 Rb8 28 a5 Nc6?? 29 Nf5! exf5 30 exf5 1-0 3618 1...Kd4! and Jones resigned because of 2 Rxe6 fxe6 3 a6 c3 4 a7 c2 5 a8=Q c1=Q+ 6 Kf3 Qh1+ and Qxa8.
