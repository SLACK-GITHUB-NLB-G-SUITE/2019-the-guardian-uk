Manchester City’s good-tempered collective post-treble party will finally end in a comedown when Leroy Sané is bundled out of the door. But to where? Not sure. Pulitzer, please! BREAKING NEWS: Eden Hazard is for the off from Chelsea! BREAKING NEWS: Paul Pogba is for the off from Manchester United! Talking of whom, Manchester United would like to replace Pogba’s creativity with João Felix of Benfica, and are prepared to stump up the player’s £105m release clause. But Real Madrid are in the marketplace too, so that is probably that. United are also interested in Kalidou Koulibaly, but Napoli won’t sell the defender for £95m. Virgil van Dijk seems very cheap these days, doesn’t he. Gabriel Batistuta could be the next manager of Middlesbrough. And to think it seemed mind-bendingly trippy when they signed Fabrizio Ravanelli in 1996. And Arsenal need a new goalkeeper. It’s not been the same since Pat Jennings/David Seaman/Jens Lehmann left. (Delete according to age.) Valencia’s Norberto Murara is their chosen man.
