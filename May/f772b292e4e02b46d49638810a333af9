Just before the EU referendum, a letter from Franklin Medhurst was published in the Guardian (Don’t abandon the Europe we fought for, 16 June 2016). This letter went viral, and a copy has been pinned to the front of my fridge ever since. It was retweeted by Jo Cox shortly before she was murdered. Sadly, Franklin Medhurst died last year at the age of 98. His obituary, written by his daughter, was published online by the Guardian on 22 October 2018. The world has changed, even since Franklin Medhurst wrote his letter. We, the people, are more informed about what is involved in leaving the EU, the current situations around the world, and here at home. I would like to think Labour party leaders, the Labour representatives in talks with the Conservatives just now, and all members of parliament of whatever party, have had a chance to think about Franklin Medhurst’s plea and put country before party.Hilary FoordAshley, Wiltshire • As Jeremy Corbyn attempts to appease both leavers and remainers, I was amused by a quote from the BBC film Leeds United in which a union official was accused of “riding two horses with one arse”.Laura FieldStockport • Is Nigel Farage’s Brexit party primarily targeting female voters?
