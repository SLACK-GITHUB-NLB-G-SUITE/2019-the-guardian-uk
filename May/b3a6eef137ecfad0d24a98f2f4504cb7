How long before the Europhobic tabloid press and the xenophobic Brextremists hold up the recent Uefa Champions League semi-finals results as irrefutable proof that European Goliaths are no match for plucky British Davids and the UK can show Johnny Foreigner what it’s like to be a world leader? However, before wrapping themselves even more tightly in the union flag, I do hope a brief glance at the winning players’ names and origins and those of their respective managers will bring them down to earth and explode the myth of British superiority in all things. Whether the more important message will get through the seemingly impenetrable fog of prejudice and ignorance, that almost half a century of European integration and cooperation has enriched all our lives, is sadly more doubtful.Malcolm BowerEuropean Movement • Two miracles on consecutive evenings.
