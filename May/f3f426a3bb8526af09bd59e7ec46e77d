Emily Atack isn’t your regular standup. Despite selling out a cross-country tour, this is the first time that the former star of sixth-form comedy The Inbetweeners has performed a solo live show. Going from zero to 100 – mimicking blowjobs, talking frankly about her weight and recalling the time she was railroaded into doing ket – would probably frighten the life out of many a new performer. However, Atack is still riding high from her appearance on the latest series of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, which took her from underemployment to starry parties and guest spots on breakfast TV – even if, as she says here, it didn’t get her the job she wanted on Keith Lemon’s Celebrity Juice. Talk Thirty to Me is a more accessible version of the quarter-life crisis genre that has become de rigueur in recent years; think Fleabag with a fixation on Ariana Grande, a prosecco permanently glued to her hand, and a calendar exploding with weddings. At 29, Atack finds that her friends are giving up alcohol because of anxiety. But, she quips, surely they’d feel better after a white wine or two? As for Joe Wicks’ healthy meals, she’d rather stick his head in the microwave. The main theme here – punctuated by tales of her own mistakes and regrets – seems to be that everyone ought to loosen up a little, especially in group WhatsApp chats. Conversely, the second, arguably more enjoyable, part of the show focuses on being a bit kinder to others, and to herself. She gives the example of her I’m a Celebrity pal Anne Hegerty, who showed a more “vulnerable” side on the show (this in turn leads to a peerless Lorraine Kelly impression from Atack, who seems to have inherited the mimicking genes of mum Kate Robbins, of Spitting Image). At times, her crusade against the cruelness of Instagram et al can sound a little trite, but Atack’s passion for honesty is endearing – even if the result is often more motivational speech than comedy show. • Tour ends 23 May.
