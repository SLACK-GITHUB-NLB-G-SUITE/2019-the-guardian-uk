Production on the latest Bond film has been delayed again, after star Daniel Craig injured his ankle while filming an action sequence in Jamaica. According to the Sun, Craig slipped and fell while running, and the subsequent ankle injury resulted in him being flown to the US for treatment. Filming scheduled to take place at Pinewood studios in London has been postponed. This is not Craig’s first injury on a Bond set: in 2006 he had two teeth knocked out while making Casino Royale, lost a fingertip on Quantum of Solace in 2008, and hurt his knee in 2015 during the shoot for Spectre. The setback is the latest of a string of delays to Craig’s fifth – and reportedly final – outing as Bond. In 2018, director Danny Boyle unexpectedly dropped out due to “creative differences” and was replaced by Cary Fukunaga. A comprehensive script overhaul has seen a string of writers work on the project, including veteran Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, Scott Z Burns and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It is not thought that Craig’s injury will affect the film’s opening date. Originally scheduled for release in November 2019, the film is now due to premiere in April 2020.
