When Sir Dragonet walked on to a horsebox for the short trip to Tipperary racecourse on 25 April even the most devoted followers of the Aidan O’Brien stable can have been only dimly aware of his existence. Thirteen days later, the son of Camelot is the second-favourite for the Derby after routing his field in the Chester Vase here on Wednesday in a performance which surely booked him a place in the Classic field at Epsom next month. For the second time in his brief career, after that winning debut, Sir Dragonet was not even the best-fancied runner from the O’Brien yard as he set off at 13-2 for the Group Three Vase, a race which has been contested by two subsequent Derby winners since 2013. Norway, with Ryan Moore taking the reins, was a couple of points shorter at 9-2 but it was clear with two furlongs to run that Sir Dragonet was not only travelling like the winner, but a very easy one too. He cruised towards the lead under Donnacha O’Brien on the turn for home and then quickened right away down the straight to cross the line eight lengths in front of Norway. O’Brien will send several more colts with Epsom pedigrees to trials for the race over the next couple of weeks, but few are likely to put as much distance between themselves and their pursuers. “We thought he was a big baby at home and that’s why he’s not entered in the Derby,” Paul Smith, whose father Derrick is a co-owner of Sir Dragonet, said. “I suppose the lads will look at it now and make a decision in a couple of weeks [whether to pay for a supplementary entry], but he’s got a beautiful Galileo pedigree, by [the 2012 Derby winner] Camelot, so it’s all there. “He obviously comes alive on the track. We needed to educate him with just the one run before and Aidan thought this was the place to come. Donnacha loved him, he said he gave him a lovely feel and is very straightforward and when he asked him, he quickened well.

It’s always a pleasant surprise. You get nervous with the big horses but with these, it’s a fact-finding mission and that’s what the trials are all about.” It is unusual for a horse to win the Derby without having run at two but far from unprecedented, as Ruler Of The World did so in 2013 when his prep race was none other than the Vase. As a result Sir Dragonet is no bigger than 7-1 with William Hill for the Derby in a market headed by Too Darn Hot, who is far from a certain starter, at 9-2. There was also an emphatic success in the Cheshire Oaks, a race that has been contested by the last two winners of the Oaks at Epsom, as Mehdaayih finished four and a half lengths clear of Manuela De Vega. She too would need to be supplemented to line up in the Classic but this was an impressive trial and she is no bigger than 6-1 second-favourite behind O’Brien’s Pink Dogwood.
