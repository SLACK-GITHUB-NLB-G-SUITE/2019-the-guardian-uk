When you shave, preparation is key. That means having a really hot face cloth and soaking the area, or shaving in or just after a shower. The hot water and steam softens the hair and open the follicles for a closer, easier shave. Always use a shaving cream or oil. Use a shaving brush to create a rich lather to raise the hairs when applying and then let it sit on your face for a minute. Shave with the grain for less irritation and make sure you don’t use disposable blades, as they can get blunted easily and cut your skin. Likewise, avoid using a cut-throat razor unless you are very experienced, as they can be dangerous and cut easily. After shaving, rinse with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel. Always make sure to finish off with your signature aftershave lotion to replace moisture and soothe the skin. Laser hair-removal has become more prevalent for men in recent years. It can be a great solution for getting rid of back or chest hair. However, I have seen younger people use it to shape their beards. Since it is permanent, I would caution against this, as it can mean you are unable to grow a different shape of beard later in life. It is also expensive and unpleasant to sit through – it can take up to 14 treatments to have a lasting effect. Thick, manly brows can look great, but a monobrow doesn’t look good on anyone. Pluck random strays after a shower, when your pores are open, but before you moisturise – otherwise the hairs will be slippery. Using good-quality tweezers, pluck the middle between the eyes and any strays under and above the brow, but don’t overpluck. Avoid using fire-based hair removal for nasal and ear hair, as they do at the barber – nasal-hair trimmers will make that job a breeze at home. Stephen Handisides is a male grooming expert.
