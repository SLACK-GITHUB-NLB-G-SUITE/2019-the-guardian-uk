Siakam also missed a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds left in regulation that could have iced the game for the Raptors. Siakam redeemed himself by blocking a potential tying shot by Brook Lopez with 43 seconds to go in the second overtime, leading to a layup for Leonard that put Toronto up 114-110 with just over 30 seconds to play. Leonard made 11 of 25 shots and went 12 for 13 at the free throw line. He had nine rebounds and five assists despite appearing to be bothered by some leg pain. “I’m feeling all right. This is playoff basketball,” Leonard said. “Everybody’s hurting so I’ve just got to keep fighting.” After suggesting Saturday that he might change his lineup, Raptors coach Nick Nurse stuck with his normal starters, but gave Powell 30 minutes, the most he’s played in any game this postseason.
