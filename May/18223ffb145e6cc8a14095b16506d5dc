On 5 May 1916, explorer Ernest Shackleton and four of his men encountered a wave like no other. The crew of Shackleton’s ship Endurance were stranded on Elephant Island in the Antarctic. Shackleton hoped to get help from South Georgia by sailing a small lifeboat across the infamous Drake Passage, reputedly the roughest stretch of sea in the world. The weather was bad. “At midnight I was at the tiller and suddenly noticed a line of clear sky between the south and south-west,” wrote Shackleton. “I called to the other men that the sky was clearing, and then a moment later I realised that what I had seen was not a rift in the clouds but the white crest of an enormous wave.” This wave was a Cape Horn Roller, bigger than any Shackleton had seen in 26 years at sea. There is uninterrupted sea at this latitude, so the fetch, or distance over which the wind produces waves, is extremely long and waves correspondingly high. Shackleton says the boat was “lifted and flung forward like a cork in breaking surf.” Amazingly it survived the seething chaos, though it half-filled with water. After 10 minutes of desperate baling the crew were thoroughly soaked but safe. The lifeboat arrived at South Georgia three days later.
