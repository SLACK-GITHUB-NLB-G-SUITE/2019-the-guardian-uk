A photograph of AFLW star Tayla Harris has been named a finalist for a new women’s sports photo award. The stunning shot of Harris in full flight is one of 15 photos in contention to claim the top gong in the professional section at the inaugural Women in Sport Photo Action Awards. The still image, captured by AFL Media photographer Michael Willson, shows the Carlton forward kicking at goal with her trademark action. Harris took a stand against online trolls after host AFL broadcaster Seven Network initially pulled down the image in response to the post attracting offensive comments. Community outrage ensured the photo was reinstated and went viral as fans splashed it across homemade T-shirts and the women’s league embraced it as an unofficial logo. The WSA photo awards are split into professional and amateur categories, with top-ranked Australian tennis player Ashleigh Barty, Matildas stars Sam Kerr and Lisa Da Vanna and Harris featuring in the professional category. “The images chosen to be #WISPAA finalists portray the finesse and fitness of Australia’s female athletes competing at all levels from club to the elite,” WSA communications director Louise Evans said. “The images chosen to be #WISPAA finalists take you beyond the gender and the sport to the core of the athlete to reveal their power, skill, athleticism and passion. They are beautiful, inspirational, gutsy images.” Award winners will be announced on 30 May.
