This recipe can be made using kangaroo or wallaby shanks; both are equally delicious. Wallaby has a stronger gamey flavour than kangaroo and the best place to get it is the ethical harvesters at Flinders Island Meats. serves 4 4 wallaby shanks1 tbsp plain flourdrizzle of olive oil1/2 onion or 2 shallots, finely diced 2 garlic cloves1 celery stalk1 carrot 400 g tinned tomatoes500 ml kangaroo or beef stock1/4 cup red wine2 tbsp ground bush tomato 1 tsp native thyme, fresh and picked, or half the amount dried and ground2 sprigs of sea rosemary1 tsp ground pepperberries2 large sprigs of fresh saltbush, chopped mashed potato, to servesea parsley, for garnish Note: If not using wallaby or roo, this recipe works for lamb too. Wash and pat-dry the shanks, then coat in flour. Heat a large, heavy-based pot with lid over high heat. Brown the shanks on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add the oil, onion, garlic, celery and carrot to the pot. Cook until soft. Add the tomatoes, stock, wine and all the spices, except the sea parsley. Put the shanks and any meat juices back in the pot, bring to the boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Put the lid on and cook for 1 1/2 – 2 hours, or until the shanks fall from the bone. Serve with mash and a sea parsley garnish. Check our resources guide for some useful places to buy from, ask your local supermarket to stock some, forage for a little (respectfully) and, better yet, grow a little too. Whether it’s a balcony or a backyard, growing herbs and greens is easier than you think.
