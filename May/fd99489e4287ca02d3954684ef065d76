Diana Ross has said she was left “violated” by an airport security check in New Orleans. The soul singer was travelling to the city to perform at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festival, when she complained of an invasive check by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff. In a series of tweets, she wrote: “On one hand I’m treated like royalty in New Orleans and at the airport I was treated like shit. “Its not what was done but how, I am feeling violated – I still feel her hands between my legs, front and back (saying to me it her job,) WOW!! really mixed emotions I always like to see the good things but not feeling good right now.” She added that the security check “was over the top !! Makes me want to cry !!!” A TSA spokesperson responded to Ross’s complaint, saying: “Initial review of CCTV indicates that the officers involved with Ms Ross’s screening correctly followed all protocols, however, TSA leadership will continue to investigate the matter further. We encourage Ms Ross to reach out to TSA so we can work with her directly to address her concerns.” In 1999, Ross was arrested at Heathrow airport and later cautioned without charge, after she was alleged to have assaulted an airport security worker. “I don’t mind being touched, but not in this way – it was far too personal,” she later said. Ross, 75, still frequently performs live, with the latest leg of her Las Vegas concert residency scheduled for June. She recently voiced support for Michael Jackson in the wake of accusations made against him of child sexual abuse, calling him “a magnificent incredible force to me and to many others”.
