The Football Association is quietly confident that the record attendance for a Women’s FA Cup final will be broken when West Ham meet Manchester City on Saturday. As of Wednesday afternoon 52,000 tickets had been sold and distributed for the game at Wembley. Under-16s go free and complimentary tickets have been issued, meaning there will likely be some drop-off, but sources say sales continue to be strong and with fewer complimentary tickets distributed than in previous years, the crowd should break the 45,423 record set when Chelsea beat Arsenal in last year’s final. The expectation of a record crowd comes despite the Premier League refusing West Ham’s request to bring forward their men’s game from a 3pm kick-off against Southampton. Some West Ham fans have said they will leave their dead-rubber Premier League match at half-time to make the 5.30pm start at Wembley. Manchester City are providing free coach travel to fans to help compensate for a limited train service. This year domestic league attendance records in Europe have been shattered. In January 48,212 watched Athletic Bilbao’s 2-0 defeat by Atlético Madrid, and two months later the Spanish record was broken again when 60,739 attended the Wanda Metropolitano for Atlético’s game against Barcelona. In Italy a record 39,000 watched Juventus beat Fiorentina in March. The record crowd for women’s football in England was set in 1920 when 53,000 watched the Dick, Kerr Ladies against St Helens Ladies at Goodison Park. England drew an attendance of 45,619 for a game against Germany at Wembley in 2014.
