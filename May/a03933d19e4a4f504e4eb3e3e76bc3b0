Prosecutors in Chicago have charged the R&B singer R Kelly with 11 new sexual crime counts, including some that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Cook county prosecutors filed the new charges against Kelly on Thursday. Among the new charges are four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, two counts of criminal sexual assault by force, two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against a victim between the ages of 13 to 16. The charges apparently pertain to a single victim. The four aggravated criminal sexual assault counts carry maximum terms of 30 years in prison. Kelly was already facing 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four women years ago, three of whom were minors when the alleged abuse occurred. Kelly’s defense attorney, Steve Greenberg, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He told the Sun-Times that he had received word of new charges from prosecutors but had not seen any filings in the case. He did say he understood that the allegations are “from years ago”.
