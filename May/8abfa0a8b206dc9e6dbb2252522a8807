Most air pollution is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and waste, and this is the focus of the World Health Organization’s global recommendations: Moving from coal and gas power stations and diesel generators to solar, wind and hydropower Prioritise walking, cycling and public transport over cars in urban areas and shift to electric cars Improve the energy efficiency of homes to reduce heating needs and avoid coal and wood burning inside Promoting waste reduction and use incineration only when unavoidable and when emissions controls are in place Reduce the burning of stubble in fields upwind of cities Create green spaces in cities to help remove some pollutants In the UK, the government’s extensive research shows deterring polluting vehicles from city and town centres is by far the quickest, most cost-effective way to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which are at illegal levels in most urban areas. Other policies include: Retrofitting of buses, heavy goods vehicles and black cabs, which is the next most effective option Scrappage schemes for older, polluting vehicles and subsidies for electric vehicles can also help reduce pollution, although ministers have cut the latter Policies such as cutting speed limits on polluted motorway sections, labelling pollution levels clearly on new cars and training people to drive more cleanly all had minimal impact The solution to air pollution is stopping it at source but until that happens, experts including the British Lung Foundation (BLF) suggest the following: Avoid spending long periods of time in places where pollution builds up, such as busy roads If you travel on foot or a bike, using backstreet routes away from congested roads can cut exposure by half. Even on busy streets, cyclists experience less pollution than drivers Some scientists recommend parents use covers on their buggies to protect infants Go to work earlier, before the rush hour has begun and levels of pollution have built up When air pollution is high and if you have lung condition such as asthma, reduce or avoid strenuous outdoor exercise, or do your exercise inside There is very little evidence to recommend the use of face masks, according to the BLF
