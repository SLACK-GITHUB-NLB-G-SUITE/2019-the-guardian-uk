When Andrés Manuel López Obrador put his presidential Boeing up for sale last year and pledged to travel economy class around Mexico, it was part of a budget-slashing populist push to get closer to the people. On Tuesday at lunchtime, as he flew low-cost to the city of Tepic, Mexico’s leftist president was thanked with an in-flight ode from one starstruck passenger. “Obrador is a great presidente and will always be able to count on our support, sí señor!” the singer warbled as her leader – best known as simply Amlo – looked on from his emergency exit window seat. “The people applaud him, they follow and respect him because we don’t want any more corruption,” the passenger, who was named only as Paloma, continued in reference to López Obrador’s pledge to crack down on thieving politicians. The president’s supporters – or “Amlovers”, as some call them – lapped up the midair homage to a politician who continues to fly high in the polls thanks to his vow to lead a historic “transformation” of their profoundly unequal nation. But critics question whether it is safe or efficient for a head of state to commute on low-cost carriers and López Obrador’s decision to travel economy has also exposed him to the wrath of some hostile Mexican voters. Mexico’s budget airlines have reveled in the free publicity, tweeting photographs of their low-cost leader on board. Tuesday’s journey provided less positive headlines, however, after Amlo’s plane was forced to abort its landing at the last minute because of “unexpected weather conditions” causing a 13-minute delay. “It was nothing serious. It’s normal,” López Obrador, 65, told reporters after safely landing in Tepic, where he was received with a second rendition of his inflight serenade.
