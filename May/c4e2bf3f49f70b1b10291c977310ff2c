Scott Parker has been backed by Fulham’s chairman, Shahid Khan, to drive the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt. Parker was on Friday appointed as their permanent manager after a spell in caretaker charge. “Scott was brave to accept a very difficult challenge in February when appointed as our caretaker manager,” said Khan. “Since that time, day by day, whether in training or on match day, we’ve undeniably become a better football club. Scott will now have another challenge to face and that is to return Fulham to the Premier League. I fully believe Scott is more than up to the task. “I appreciate that he’s been clear for many years that his ultimate goal is to excel as a manager, and he will be given every opportunity to succeed at Fulham. I also have no doubt that he knows and loves this club every bit as much as our supporters, and that’s an intangible that everyone can welcome.” Parker, a former England midfielder who played for clubs including Chelsea, Newcastle and Fulham, returned to Craven Cottage as first-team coach last summer and took his first managerial role when Claudio Ranieri was sacked after a short spell. He said he was delighted to take the job full-time and added: “I thank the chairman for entrusting me with this responsibility, as well as the support and encouragement that both he and [vice-chairman] Tony Khan have provided me. “The players, staff and fans have all been fantastic with me since I took temporary charge. We are now all focused on ending this campaign with a positive result on Sunday against Newcastle and look forward to preparations for the new season, which have already begun.”
