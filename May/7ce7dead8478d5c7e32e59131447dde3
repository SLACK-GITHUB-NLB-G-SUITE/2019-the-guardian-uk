Rosamund Sutherland undertook important work on the teaching of algebra in schools. The report that she produced in 1997 as the chair of the Royal Society/Joint Mathematical Council working group was influential in shaping the 1999 national curriculum review in mathematics. I was one of the members of the mathematics team at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) that had the responsibility for writing this curriculum. Ros worked very closely with us and helped shape the final form of the curriculum. She was frequently used as a consultant: she produced a comparative report for QCA on primary maths text books from different countries, emphasising why the books published in England often missed the essential teaching points, and actually caused confusion for pupils and teachers. She was also influential in helping to shape a new class of post-16 qualifications called free-standing mathematics qualifications, aimed at those candidates who had not been very successful in GCSE maths. Ros believed strongly that maths qualifications were important to all, and she gave much thought on how to motivate the less strong and more anxious students.
