James Harden made a big three-pointer in overtime and scored 41 points, and the Houston Rockets outlasted the Golden State Warriors 126-121 on Saturday night to cut the deficit in the Western Conference semifinals to 2-1. A layup by PJ Tucker put Houston up by three with two minutes left and the Warriors missed shots on their next two possessions. That set up the three-pointer by Harden with 49 seconds left that made it 124-118. Kevin Durant made three free throws after that, but Harden added a layup to stretch the lead. Stephen Curry, who dislocated a finger in Game 2, missed a wide-open layup and Harden grabbed the rebound to secure Houstonâ€™s victory.

Game 4 is on Monday night in Houston. Harden led the team despite recovering from injuries to both eyes he sustained in Game 2 when he was hit in the face by Draymond Green. He was feeling better on Saturday, but both eyes remained bloody red in spots.
