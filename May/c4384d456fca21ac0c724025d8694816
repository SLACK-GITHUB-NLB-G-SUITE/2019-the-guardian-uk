This year’s Lockinge Stakes may not be full of top-class horses but it poses as tricky a puzzle for punters as almost any handicap. Remarkably, 13 of the 14 runners at Newbury are rated within 2lb of each other, the only outlier being Billesdon Brook, who has failed to build on her Guineas win. Laurens (3.40), the filly who chased her home that day, has since proved a much more reliable prospect at the highest level and can beat the boys here. Turning over Alpha Centauri was the highlight of her Group One wins last year and though she has been tried at various distances, a mile has brought out the best in her. Le Brivido is talented and a big threat but it is nearly two years since he won a race and he has a bit to prove. 1.50 Newbury A comfortable winner of a handicap at the Guineas meeting from a mark of 98, Moyassar is surely up to winning in Listed class. Red Impression is one to worry about, with the Roger Charlton yard showing signs of coming into form. 2.05 Newmarket Raise You is the obvious one for this Listed prize but the ground will be a lot faster this time than when he won a month ago and there is a slight concern that his yard, which was in form at the time, has cooled off considerably. It may pay to go with Khuzaam, so impressive in a couple of all-weather starts at the end of last year. He still holds a Derby entry. 2.25 Newbury This looks like an easy £56,000 for connections of Crystal Ocean, who belongs in a higher grade. It hardly seems fair that Raymond Tusk, rated a stone below him on official ratings, actually has to give him weight here. 2.40 Newmarket The only defeat in Jash’s form so far was the Middle Park Stakes, in which he was half a length behind Ten Sovereigns. He should be too good for these, for all that Far Above ran very promisingly on his debut. 3.00 Newbury There was abundant promise in the way Sinjaari won his maiden race at Windsor last month and he might prove to be very well treated for this handicap debut. He will need to be, as this is usually a hot contest and Solid Stone looks especially dangerous. 3.15 Newmarket With the stalls against the stands’ rail, those drawn high may have an edge, so a chance is taken on Kamikaze Lord in stall 16. He was keen and failed to stay a mile on his handicap debut at Newmarket’s Craven meeting but sprinting should suit him better and he has the speed to take advantage if the rail is the right place to be.
