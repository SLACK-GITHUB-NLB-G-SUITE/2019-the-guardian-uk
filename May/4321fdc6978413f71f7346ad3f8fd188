Angelique Kerber’s bid to complete a career slam at this year’s French Open fell at the first hurdle, as she lost 6-4, 6-2 to Anastasia Potapova in the first round. Kerber, winner of last year’s Wimbledon as well as the 2016 Australian and US Open titles, saw her preparations for Roland Garros hampered by an ankle injury she suffered at the Madrid Open. Serving to stay in the first set, Kerber led 40-0 but was broken by her 18-year-old opponent, who then raced into a 4-0 lead in the second set, breaking the No 5 seed’s serve twice. Kerber pulled one break back but missed a chance to keep the pressure on the world No 70 in her next service game, putting a forehand wide at deuce. Potapova then raced to three match points on Kerber’s serve. The German saved the first two before another wide forehand sealed her fate. “She really played good. I tried my best,” Kerber said afterwards. “I was able to practise the last few days really good, but it was not really a long clay-court preparation with everything. I was happy to at least go on court, playing a match. Of course it’s not like I hoped for.” Garbiñe Muguruza avoided an upset after losing the first set 7-5 to the USA’s Taylor Townsend. The 2016 champion rallied in style, winning the next two sets for the loss of four games as she won 5-7, 6-2, 6-2.
