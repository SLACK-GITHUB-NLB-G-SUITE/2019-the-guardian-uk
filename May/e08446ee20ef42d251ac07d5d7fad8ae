Stradivarius made a triumphant return to action with a battling display in the Yorkshire Cup. John Gosden’s charge was the undoubted star of the staying division in 2018, winning each of his five starts. The five-year-old landed the inaugural Weatherbys Hamilton Stayers’ Million by following up victory in this Group Two qualifier with triumphs in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, the Goodwood Cup and the Lonsdale Cup – and added the Qipco British Champions Long Distance Cup just for good measure. Making his first appearance since that Champions Day triumph in October and saddled with a 3lb penalty, Stradivarius was the 4-5 favourite in the hands of Frankie Dettori and although he came under pressure early in the home straight, he responded generously to his rider’s urgings. Aidan O’Brien’s Irish challenger Southern France had the benefit of a run already this season and did his best to make a race of it, but with the rail to help, Dettori’s mount got on top close home and passed the post a comfortable three-quarters of a length to the good. Mildenberger fared best of the rest in third, with Dubai Gold Cup runner-up Ispolini a shade disappointing in fourth. “It was brilliant,” said Dettori. “There was the penalty and he was a bit rusty. There wasn’t much of a pace, it was more of a sprint. It took me a while to get to Ryan [Moore, on Southern France], but once we got upsides there was only going to be one winner. He’s a fighter and he’s got me out of trouble so many times. He just put his head down and went. “It started a good pace and slackened in the middle of the race and turned into a three-and-a-half-furlong sprint. There were fitter horses in front, but I’ve got Stradivarius – he’s a joy to have around. He’s going to be a big name in the staying division again. He’s not flash, but you know you’re going to win a fight with him.” Newbury 1.35 Posted 2.10 Embour 2.45 Light Angel 3.20 Carp Kid 3.55 Jubiloso 4.25 High Commissioner 4.55 Ballylemon 5.30 Bristol Missile York 1.50 Iva Go 2.25 Natalie’s Joy 3.00 Stradivarius 3.35 UAE Prince 4.05 Electric Landlady (nb) 4.35 Tenax (nap) 5.05 Skymax Newmarket 2.00 Redemptive 2.35 Mr Tyrrell 3.10 Perfect Illusion 3.45 Reshoun 4.15 Land Of Legends 4.45 Enigmatic 5.15 Major Valentine Aintree 5.35 Stop Talking 6.10 Casablanca Mix 6.40 Solo Saxophone 7.10 Theatre Legend 7.45 Oldgrangewood 8.20 Ready And Able 8.50 Bird On The Wire Hamilton 5.55 Glasvegas 6.25 Kripke 7.00 Granite City Doc 7.30 Theglasgowwarrior 8.05 Epona 8.35 Tommy G 9.05 Highly Focussed
