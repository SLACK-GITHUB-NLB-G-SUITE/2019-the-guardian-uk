The St Louis Blues are marching into the Stanley Cup final for the first time in decades. David Perron had a goal and an assist, Jordan Binnington picked up his franchise-record 12th playoff win and the Blues eliminated the San Jose Sharks with a 5-1 win in Game 6 of the Western Conference final on Tuesday night. Vladimir Tarasenko, Brayden Schenn and Tyler Bozak also scored for St Louis, who will face the Boston Bruins for the championship. “We always believed we could do this,” said Tarasenko, who had a point in every game of the series. “But it’s still an unbelievable feeling.” St Louis won three consecutive games to advance to the franchise’s first Cup final since 1970. That series also pitted the Blues against the Bruins. Game 1 is on Monday night in Boston. Laura Branigan’s “Gloria” blared over the speakers at the Blues’ home arena after the latest victory on an improbable run from last in the NHL on 3 January to one of the final two teams standing. The turnaround came after Craig Berube replaced Mike Yeo as coach in November and Binnington took over as the starting goaltender in January. “We always had the talent,” said Doug Armstrong, the general manager and president of hockey operations for the Blues. “But we were finding ways to lose games instead of winning them. They turned it around and just haven’t stopping going.” Berube gave his team credit for working its way through a coaching change and several months of disappointing play. “We were trying to get on the right track,” Berube said. “Once we got going in January and February, I knew we had a good hockey team. Once you get into the playoffs anything can happen and it did.” The Sharks took a 2-1 lead in the series, but were outscored 12-2 in losing the final three games. “I think the two hardest, heaviest teams are in the final,” San Jose coach Peter DeBoer said. “There wasn’t any room out there. And when there was Binnington made some saves.”
