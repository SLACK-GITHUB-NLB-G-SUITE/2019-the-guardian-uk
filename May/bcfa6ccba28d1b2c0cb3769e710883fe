You report that 40 museums in England have closed in the period between 2005 and 2014 (Survival of museums on cliff edge with councils forced to cut ‘luxury’ services, 8 May). In fact, the figures are far worse. The Mapping Museums research team have systematically collected data on UK museums and we found 173 closures during that period, with a total of 227 since 2005. The highest closure rates are in the north-west and south-west regions, the lowest in the south-east.
