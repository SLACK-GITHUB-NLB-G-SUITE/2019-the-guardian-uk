As a sixth former in Stoke-on-Trent in the early 1960s, I had the good fortune to encounter Brian Walden (Obituary, 13 May) at meetings of the Council for Education in World Citizenship. An inspirational speaker, he was also prepared to engage with students who had little experience of the world. He was always courteous, positive and encouraging. Linda RheadHampton, London • Your report (Judge’s copy of Lady Chatterley, with rude bits marked, barred from export, 14 May) noted that “the book [helped] to redefine British attitudes to sex”. Sad then to see the trope of “the handsome, lusty gamekeeper”. Wouldn’t “tender and mutely empathetic” have been nearer the mark?Clare SmedleyRudyard, Staffordshire • In 1961, in the girls-only grammar school in Alnwick, Northumberland, a group of sixth formers gathered with a secretly obtained brown-paper-backed copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and we learned how to “do sex”. Amazing, but invaluable!Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • Chris Holdsworth’s list of West Indians who played Lancashire League cricket in the early 50s (Letters, 14 May) omits Everton Weekes, perhaps the greatest of them all. He was the club pro for seven seasons at Bacup, where I watched him in awe as a young boy. He scored 9,069 runs for Bacup at an average of 91.61, including 25 centuries. Mick BeebyBristol • Headline: “Guardiola reaches goal by persuading players to discover unexplored potential” (14 May). Please! “Sheikh Mansour wins league by spending £750m on players and hiring best manager in the world” would be closer to the truth.
