Liverpool are planning a friendly at their Marbella training camp this weekend as Jürgen Klopp steps up preparations for the Champions League final against Tottenham. The Liverpool manager wants his players back in match action before the Madrid final on 1 June as it will be a fortnight on Sunday since their last competitive outing against Wolves. Liverpool’s opponents have still to be confirmed, with the end of domestic seasons and international commitments complicating the search, but Klopp’s team will face an under-23s or academy side if a friendly with senior opposition cannot be arranged. Klopp is particularly keen to give Roberto Firmino a run-out as the striker has missed Liverpool’s past three matches with a groin problem, although he returned to training in Spain. Sheyi Ojo, meanwhile, is set to sign a new five-year contract with Liverpool before going out on loan again. The 21-year-old winger has spent this season on loan at Stade de Reims but will not be returning to the French club. Steven Gerrard is an admirer of Ojo from his work at Liverpool’s academy and Rangers are expected to be among the interested clubs.
