An ageing drag queen gets a diagnosis of terminal cancer and makes a new friend in this touching, unexpectedly funny end-of-life drama set in Brighton, with a terrific performance by 83-year-old Derren Nesbitt. It must have taken real guts for him to let the camera in so close, following him naked into the shower and under the harsh lights. Nesbitt plays Jack Collins, who initially looks like retired brickie. But, under a towering beehive wig, Jack becomes Jackie, the main attraction at a drag club, performing mildly offensive un-PC comedy routines that go down a storm with the millennial audience. Jack’s diagnosis comes after he collapses on stage. But the show must go on and, a few nights later, he rescues a young singer, Faith (Jordan Stephens, one half of hip-hop duo Rizzle Kicks), from homophobic attackers. Faith is non-binary, assigned male at birth. Jack is straight; he was once married and has a daughter, but that life is long gone. Nesbitt beautifully unpicks the complexity of this man: the quiver of heartbreak, his regret at hurting the people he loved alongside his dignity at doing what he loves, sticking up two fingers to the haters. Still, there are false emotional beats here and there, and scenes that don’t feel real – such as the hospital consultation where a doctor gives Jack the precise prognosis of six to seven weeks. While some movies are made for the LGBTQ community, Tucked is more interested in building a portrait of kindness and friendship than exploring identity.
