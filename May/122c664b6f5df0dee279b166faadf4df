Nigel Farage has been forced to seek refuge on his campaign bus after being stalked by people carrying milkshakes in Kent, according to reports. The Brexit party leader and his campaign team seemed keen to avoid a repeat of events in Newcastle on Monday, when he was doused in banana and salted caramel milkshake after making a speech. Following a tour of Dartford and Gravesend before Thursday’s EU elections, things took an unfortunate turn for Farage in Rochester, where three young men wearing balaclavas with their hoods up were spotted by a supporter. He was then told to stay on the bus. Its driver, Michael Bolton, told the Kent Live website: “There are a couple of guys standing over there with milkshakes, they were going to throw them over him. But the police are there, we’ve spotted them and now Nigel isn’t getting off the bus.” According to Kent Live, Farage eventually got off the bus but remained cautiously close to the vehicle as he spoke to some of his supporters, despite having strolled along the high street in the other Kent towns. Police liaison officers in Rochester also spoke to two men shouting anti-Farage slogans at the bus while holding iced lattes, according to the Mirror. The former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, who is standing as an independent, and the Ukip MEP candidate Carl Benjamin have also been “milkshaked” by protesters in the run-up to the vote. Speaking to reporters in Kent on Wednesday, Farage said: “It’s a big day tomorrow, a chance to stun the establishment. I don’t know if the opinion polls are right but if they are the Brexit party could win and it could win big. It could change the whole political agenda, I reckon that’s pretty exciting.” Asked by Kent Live whether he had a spare suit with him, Farage did not respond.
