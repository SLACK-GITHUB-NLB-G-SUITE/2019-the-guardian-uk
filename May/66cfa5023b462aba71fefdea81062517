John Terry has emerged as a contender for the managerial vacancy at Middlesbrough. Aston Villa’s assistant head coach is among those competing with a fellow former England centre-half Jonathan Woodgate for a job which Slavisa Jokanovic has also been shortlisted. Although Terry’s immediate priority is helping Dean Smith’s side in Monday’s play-off final against Derby County, he has spoken to Middlesbrough this week and Steve Gibson, Boro’s chairman, is expected to spend the weekend pondering his choice to replace Tony Pulis. An appointment is expected by the end of next week. Jokanovic has previously led Fulham and Watford to promotion from the Championship, is available and has been interviewed in London but Gibson is also giving serious consideration to the credentials of Paul Heckingbottom. The former Barnsley and Leeds manager is in charge at Hibs but could be strongly tempted by the chance to move back south of the border and would almost certainly be prepared to work with a smaller budget than Jokanovic. Boro finished seventh in the Championship this season, missing out on the play-offs by a single point, and Gibson has responded by initiating a significant overhaul which has already seen some backroom staff lose their jobs. The club’s owner must weigh up the benefits of Jokanovic’s experience against the Teesside-born Woodgate’s impressive stint as first-team coach and Terry’s evident potential. Gibson has never been afraid to offer bright young coaches chances and is responsible for giving Bryan Robson, Steve McClaren, Gareth Southgate and Aitor Karanka their first managerial jobs. Michael Reiziger’s name has also been mentioned in connection with the vacancy but the former Netherlands defender and current Ajax reserve team coach is not believed to have spoken to Boro.
