Pondicherry is a very beautiful former French town on India’s east coast, and this is my version of India’s take on French toast – hence the name, Pondicherry toast. Chickpea flour is mixed with yoghurt, coriander, chilli and cumin, then pan-fried to create a delicious giant bread pakora. Many Indians eat this as an after-school or work snack; I like it for Sunday breakfast, with chai, ketchup and Lata Mangeshkar’s syrupy music on in the background. If you’re slicing your own bread, cut it as thinly as shop-bought sliced bread, because that makes for a better ratio of batter to bread. Beware: some “plain” soya yoghurts have sugar in them, so do check the label. I use Sojade’s ‘So Soya!’ Prep 10 minCook 16 minMakes 4 toasts, to serve 2-4 100g chickpea flour (aka gram flour or besan) 120g soya yoghurt2 tbsp lemon juice1 large handful coriander leaves, finely shredded 1 tsp cumin powder 1 green finger chilli, very finely chopped½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder½ tsp salt 4 thin slices breadRapeseed oil, for frying In a bowl, whisk the chickpea flour with the yoghurt until there are no lumps, then add all the other ingredients except the bread and oil, and mix thoroughly. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan until hot. Meanwhile, dunk one slice of bread in the batter, making sure to coat both sides (but don’t give it a bath). Carefully lay the bread in the hot pan and cook for a minute and a half to two minutes, until golden brown on the underside, then flip over with a fish slice and cook for the same time on the other side. Slide or lift the toast on to a serving plate and keep warm while you repeat with the other three slices of bread, making sure you get enough of the herbs and spices in the bottom of the batter bowl on each side. Serve hot with ketchup.
