Australia’s Caleb Ewan claimed a second career stage win on the Giro d’Italia when he prevailed in the eighth stage, a 239km ride from Tortoreto Lido to Pesaro. The Lotto-Soudal rider, a stage winner in 2017, was perfectly positioned after a tight bend 200m from the line and beat the Italian champion Elia Viviani in a short sprint. Germany’s Pascal Ackermann, who leads the points classification, took third place. The home favourite Valerio Conti of UAE Emirates retained the overall leader’s pink jersey. Ewan said: “Determination and the help of the team made me a winner today. We’ve been trying for seven days to get this win. I’m just so happy to win this stage. I wanted to be first in the last corner but it was still a long way away, so it worked better to get out of Ackermann’s wheel. I knew I had a good kick and I went around him.” Britain’s Simon Yates, riding for the Mitchelton-Scott team, finished with the same time as the rest of the peloton – 5hr 43min 32sec. He remains 15th overall, 5min 59sec behind Conti. Sunday’s ninth stage is a 34.8km individual time trial from Riccione to San Marino, featuring a 12.25km climb at the finish.
