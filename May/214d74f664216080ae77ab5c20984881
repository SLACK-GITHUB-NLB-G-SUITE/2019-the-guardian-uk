The diary of Charles Carty during the Falklands War was the cover story of the Observer Magazine of 17 October 1982 (‘The Sergeant-Major’s War’). It covered departure aboard the QE2 from Southampton to the fatal Argentine air strike in Fitzroy Bay. There’s a stark contrast between the opening picture of soldiers sunbathing on the deck of the QE2 and the next page where we see the Sir Galahad on fire after it’s been hit by Argentine fighter-bombers – 48 British soldiers died. When the British army embarked on the QE2, ‘everyone was looking forward to a luxurious trip,’ admitted Carty, who was with the Welsh Guards. ‘As we went aboard she was still being fitted with military bits and pieces. The food we had must have been stocked up for the next cruise: the Army doesn’t feed you like that. We sometimes had prawn cocktail for starters’. But the upbeat mood didn’t last long. ‘I think it hit us halfway out what we were doing. The thought in a lot of people’s minds was that we could have been part of a giant bluff.’ If only. The Welsh Guards tried to put in as much training as possible. ‘The sun deck was used for physical exercise sessions and groups ran circuits around the deck. There were briefings on the Falklands terrain.’ Target practice meant trying to hit plastic bags full of the ship’s rubbish thrown overboard. The explosion on the Sir Galahad on 8 June 1982 ‘sent me flying and the next thing I knew was this young guardsman with part of his boot blown away trying to get up the companionway… Initially it was chaos, but then in the darkness you could hear people taking command and issuing orders. ‘There is no doubt in my mind that the islanders didn’t want the Argies there, but the Falklands is a small place and I think in their hearts they wished we would bugger off as well.’
