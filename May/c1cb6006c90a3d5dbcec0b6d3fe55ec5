Elton John has said he is ashamed of the UK over its voting for and handling of Brexit. While performing on Wednesday in Verona on his last ever world tour, Farewell Yellow Brick Road, he said: “I’m ashamed of my country for what it has done. It’s torn people apart … I am sick to death of politicians, especially British politicians. I am sick to death of Brexit. I am a European. I am not a stupid, colonial, imperialist English idiot.” John has previously expressed his dismay over Brexit. In July 2018, he said: “I don’t think people in Britain were told the truth to start with … They were promised something that was completely ridiculous and wasn’t economically viable.” He said the Brexit process was confusing, like “walking through Hampton Court maze blindfolded, being turned around 16 times and trying to find your way out”. The singer’s profile is currently as high as it has been in years. As well as the world tour, he is preparing to publish his first autobiography in the autumn. Rocketman, a biopic about his rise to fame and struggles with substance misuse, is currently in cinemas. He will perform two UK dates this month, in Hove and Cardiff, before returning in November 2020 for 18 further UK dates. He was forced to cancel Thursday’s concert in Verona under doctor’s orders, after his vocal cords were inflamed due to a cold, but his management expect him to be well enough to perform in Wiesbaden, Germany, on Saturday.
