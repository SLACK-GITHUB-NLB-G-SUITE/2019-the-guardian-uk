Hillary and Chelsea Clinton are to form a film and TV company to produce female-centric content. Bloomberg and the Hollywood Reporter have confirmed that the pair are in talks with studios about “a pipeline of programmes” aimed at influencing culture and society now that Hillary Clinton is out of politics. Last August the former Democratic presidential candidate, secretary of state and first lady signed a deal to executive produce The Women’s Hour, a Steven Spielberg-produced series about the suffrage movement. Former president Barack Obama recently founded a film and TV production company called Higher Ground with his wife, Michelle. The outfit is partnering with Netflix and last month released its initial slate of seven projects, also with the stated ambition of altering society. “Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more,” said Obama, “we believe each of these productions won’t just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all.” The three films and four TV series include a show about recently deceased people who have made significant grassroots change, and one for pre-school children about vegetables around the world. A play about Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 run for the presidency is currently on Broadway, with Laurie Metcalf in the leading role. Clinton’s 2017 biography, What Happened met with positive reviews and considerable sales. Chelsea Clinton briefly worked as a special correspondent for TV network NBC, and more recently has authored five children’s books, including the bestselling She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World.
