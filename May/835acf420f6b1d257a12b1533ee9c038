Tiger Woods has been named in a wrongful death lawsuit involving a former employee at his Florida restaurant, The Woods. The parents of Nicholas Immesberger say their son, who worked as a bartender at The Woods, was regularly served excessive alcohol after he ended his shift, despite the fact that Woods and others at the restaurant knew he was an alcoholic. On the night of 10 December 2018, Immesberger drank after his shift and subsequently crashed his car on the way home. The 24-year-old was killed in the crash; tests showed he was three times over the legal limit for alcohol. Woods’s girlfriend, Erica Herman, who manages the restaurant, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. “Tiger knew, or reasonably should have known, that Immesberger was habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages, and/or was a habitual drunkard,” the lawsuit says. The suit does not specify whether Woods and Herman were present on the night of 10 December but it does say they were “drinking with [Immesberger] at The Woods bar only a few nights before the fatal crash of December 10, 2018.” Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom this month, and is due to play in the US PGA Championship later this week.
