Julian Williams sprung a shocking upset of the previously unbeaten Jarrett Hurd to capture the WBA and IBF junior middleweight titles on Saturday night at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia. Williams, who went off as a 5-1 underdog in Hurd’s backyard, floored the champion in the second round on his way to a unanimous decision after 12 rounds of mostly close-quarters action by scores of 116-111 and 115-112 (twice) on the campus of George Mason University. The wildly entertaining scrap completed a comeback for the 29-year-old from West Philadelphia known as J Rock, who has won five in a row since suffering a fifth-round knockout loss to Jermall Charlo in his only other world title shot in December 2016.

I got so motivated because everybody was doubting me. I turned my Twitter off, I turned my Instagram off. I blocked out all the good stuff, I blocked out all the bad stuff. The boxing world, they make it seem like fighters take a loss and they can’t come back, and I just knew that wasn’t the case. Stop condemning fighters after they take a loss.” Have your moment, @Jrockboxing 👏👏 pic.twitter.com/gxVvQQTXDS After a quiet first round, Williams appeared to hurt Hurd midway through the second with a pair of combinations, then dropped him with about 30 seconds left with a left hook. Hurd, who was making his fourth title defense, rose quickly, but Williams closed on him again as the bell sounded. Williams continued to look in control until the close of the fifth, when Hurd got him to the ropes and landed a damaging combination. Hurd then opened the sixth as if he believed Williams had been hurt, connecting with a very early right hook that set off a ferocious round from both fighters and brought chants from the partisan crowd of 5,105. But by the end of the seventh, Hurd’s corner was attending to a cut over his right eye, and he failed to recapture that energy in the building. “He wasn’t easier to hit than I thought,” Williams said of his opponent. “He was crafty and he had heavy hands. I just stayed poised. I listened to my coach and I just worked.” Williams (27-1-1, 17 KOs) said he would be open to doing the contractually mandated rematch in Philadelphia after going on the road to meet Hurd on Saturday near his hometown of Accokeek, Maryland. Hurd (23-1, 16 KOs), who was coming off a fourth-round knockout of Jason Welborn on the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder undercard in December, was classy in defeat. “J Rock was the better man tonight,” the 28-year-old Hurd said. “He put me down for the first time in my career and he came out with a victory. No nerves had anything to do with it.” He added: “There’s definitely a rematch clause in our contract, and I’m going to go for it. I’m going to come back better than I was tonight.”
