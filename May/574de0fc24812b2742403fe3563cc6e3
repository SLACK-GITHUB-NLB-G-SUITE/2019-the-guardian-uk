Have you reconnected with a friend or partner after many years apart? We want to hear from people who have tried to reconnect with childhood friends as adults, or have rekindled past flames after losing contact for a long time. Perhaps you lost touch with a relative and have since rebuilt that relationship, or found your best friend from school after decades of no contact. After reuniting, have you found that you still have a close connection after so many years, or does the passing of time mean something is lost? If you reconnected with a friend, was it a one-off or have you remained friends? Or have you rekindled young love? Share your stories of rebuilding long-lost relationships. Tell us how and why you chose to reconnect after so many years, and if you have you been able to get the relationship back to what it was. Include as much information as you can about reforming the relationship. One of our reporters may contact you to discuss further and we may feature some of your responses in our reporting.
