Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2018-19 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line … Manchester City had 20 minutes left to find a goal to avoid handing the initiative back to Liverpool in a title race with no room for error. But Leicester were strong and pesky. Pep Guardiola’s team were running out of ideas. Vincent Kompany had a brainwave. Why couldn’t he, a 33-year-old centre-back who had not hit the target with a long-range shot since he was a lithe young thing in his mid-20s, rocket one into the top corner from 30 yards? “No,” hollered his teammates, “don’t shoot!” Bang! And, indeed, boom! Kompany walloped the ball into the one place no one thought he could put it, the one place Kasper Schmeichel couldn’t reach. 1-0.

Andros Townsend did not disagree. “It was the sweetest strike of my career,” he said of the volley he lashed past Ederson from 30 yards after Bernardo Silva headed the ball towards him, thinking the danger had been cleared. The Portuguese was lucky not to suffer whiplash as he turned to watch the ball fly back past him.

With one slinky touch he took it under control as he turned, then he shifted on to a higher plane, making space-time calculations at a speed incomprehensible to those around him before cutting past them with exquisite balance and efficiency. He ghosted between Mark Noble and Declan Rice before they knew what was happening, then he slalomed past Angelo Ogbonna and Fabián Balbuena, before firing into the net from 15 yards just as Ryan Fredericks crunched into him. For most players there had not even been an opportunity to score; Hazard never looked like missing.

This was not one of those times. Aaron Ramsey sprang from the bench and immediately launched an intricate attack through which Arsenal swept from back to front through a series of slick touches. Ramsey crowned the move with a suitably delicious finish, running on to a pull-back by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and flicking the ball into the net, via a post, with a sublime backheel 38 seconds after his arrival on to the pitch. Sign him up! Or don’t, as the case proved for Arsenal. There are different ways to stick the ball in Chelsea’s top corner from 25 yards. At Stamford Bridge in September, Daniel Sturridge measured out the angles and then simply stroked it in for an effortless last-minute equaliser. Then in April, in a match billed as Liverpool’s hardest in the run-in and trailed by reminiscences of Steven Gerrard’s infamous slip, Mohamed Salah took a more blockbusting approach. After collecting the ball wide on the right, he accelerated away from Emerson and lashed a shocking strike straight into the net, leaving the world’s most expensive goalkeeper agog. His celebration – balancing on one leg in yogic calm – invited a question: want to stop talking about that slip now?
