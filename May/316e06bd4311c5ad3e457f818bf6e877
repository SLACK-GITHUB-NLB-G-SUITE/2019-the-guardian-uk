The funeral for the Oscar-nominated director John Singleton will be held in Los Angeles on Monday, his representative has said. Singleton, best known for making the 1991 drama Boyz N The Hood, died on 29 April, almost two weeks after he had a stroke. He was 51. He will be laid to rest in his home city of Los Angeles in a ceremony for family and close friends. The representative said it would be a “very small, intimate goodbye” and would not be open to the press or public. Singleton’s family is planning a larger memorial in a few weeks to celebrate his life. Barack Obama was among those to pay tribute after Singleton’s death, saying he had “opened doors for film-makers of colour to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored”. Boyz N The Hood was based on Singleton’s upbringing and was shot in his old neighbourhood. It starred Cuba Gooding Jr as a rebellious teen whose single mother sends him to live with his father in South Central Los Angeles. Singleton became the first black director to receive an Academy Award nomination, and the youngest to do so, and also received a screenplay nomination. His other films included Poetic Justice, Rosewood and Shaft.
