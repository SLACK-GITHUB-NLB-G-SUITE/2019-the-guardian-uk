I really would like to know what it is about Spiked that makes us “hard right” (In hounding Greta Thunberg the right shows it has no ideas, Journal, 2 May). Is it that we oppose all forms of censorship? Or that we are in favour of democracy? Perhaps it is that we are implacably pro-choice. Or that we frequently call for the abolition of the House of Lords and the monarchy. Is it our numerous op-eds calling for a generous and liberal immigration policy? Or our critique of the racist, Malthusian idea that the world is overpopulated? Maybe it’s our position on the “alt-right”, whom we have described as “pond scum”, or our columns on Trump, the most recent of which branded him a “thoroughly unethical, imperial president”. Is it our longstanding opposition to western intervention overseas? Or our support for Kurdish revolutionaries? Or our cheering of Iranian feminists? Kindly inform me which of these positions is “hard right” so that I can expunge it from my magazine.Brendan O’NeillEditor, Spiked • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
