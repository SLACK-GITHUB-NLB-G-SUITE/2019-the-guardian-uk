Penrith Panthers NRL utility Tyrone May will remain on bail after facing a Sydney court on charges of recording and distributing sexual acts without consent. Police allege May filmed two women without their knowledge while they engaged in sexual acts with him on separate occasions at Coffs Harbour and Kingswood in 2018. Both women were unaware they were being filmed and did not consent to the recording or its distribution, detectives have said. The 22-year-old’s case on Wednesday was adjourned to 17 June in Penrith Local Court by magistrate Geoffrey Hiatt, who formally disqualified himself from the matter “for the sake of fairness to all”. Mr Hiatt revealed his father, John Hiatt, had previously served as the deputy chairman of the Penrith Panthers. John Hiatt resigned as deputy chairman of the club in 2015. He had served on the Panthers board of directors since 2003 and was deputy chairman for six years. May was accompanied by manager Darryl Mather on Wednesday. The player remained silent as he left the Penrith court. It was May’s first appearance since he was charged in March after handing himself in to police following the release of the sex tapes on the internet. May was stood down at the time by Penrith under the NRL’s controversial “no fault” policy for those facing serious criminal charges, but has continued to train with the club. May was widely tipped to be a part of the Panthers’ top 17 this year as utility, forcing the club to adopt a dual hooker system in his absence. He is one of three players stood down by the NRL under its new policy, which is currently being fought in federal court by St George Illawarra star Jack de Belin. An outcome for the De Belin case is expected this week, with the Dragons lock likely to return to the game should the court rule in his favour.
