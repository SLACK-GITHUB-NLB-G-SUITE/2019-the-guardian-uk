The cast of The Three Musketeers tell us they have been friends since primary school, where they used to act out the adventures of Alexandre Dumas’ swashbuckling gang. Writer and director John Nicholson’s production for Le Navet Bete embraces this wide-eyed sense of schooldays adventure. There is a delightful sense of camaraderie but the humour hasn’t matured much. Our clumsy heroes are Dan Bianchi, Nick Bunt, Al Dunn and Matt Freeman. They gallivant up and down Ti Green’s lovely lopsided treehouse with one eye always on the idea of play; bikes become revving horses and toy ducks take flight. It leans into panto; farce laced with dad jokes, dodgy European accents and every word delivered earnestly outwards. They’re pumped so full of enthusiasm, they’re close to bursting. The show frequently feels like a SparkNotes guide as we zip through the touch points of the 17th-century plot. Too much exposition; stakes too low. Impressively, the cast play more than 50 parts between them, with beards and tunics repeatedly whipped on and off. Mishaps are managed with flair; a fluffed line met with a knowing stare. Much of the quick-change success is down to stage manager Abi Cowan who plays almost as many parts as the cast and has a wonderful moment with a leaf blower. It’s all a bit slapdash until a striking scene near the end that veers between a duel and a dance. (Choreography is by Lea Anderson.) So they can fight – they just wait two hours to do it! Le Navet Bete have clearly had a great time making this. It’s a shame it’s more fun to make than to watch. At Exeter Northcott theatre until 5 May. Then touring.
