We are at a crossroads where adopting a definition of Islamophobia has become critical. There is substantial evidence that Muslims are being prevented from enjoying their freedoms and participating more fully in political, economic, social, cultural and other fields of public life, and face increasing bigotry in public spaces and online. It is clear from those who are resisting a definition of Islamophobia for public policy purposes that Islamophobia is poorly understood (Definition of Islamophobia is rejected by government, 16 May). Rather than being viewed as harm being experienced by Muslims in their daily lives, it is perceived as an attack on free speech or the ability to criticise a set of beliefs. It is difficult to understand how defining a form of hatred against a group and bringing it in line with other forms of racism (and legislation) will stifle freedom of speech and undermine counter-terrorism legislation. If free speech and/or counter-terrorism legislation is not unfairly singling out one group or community, there is no reason to believe that the adoption of a definition of Islamophobia will pose a threat to security and/or free speech. As strong supporters of anti-racism and equality laws, we believe that people should be treated according to their individual attributes rather than stereotypes and misperceptions of group attributes. There is strong evidence that Muslim communities are suffering considerable discrimination. Of course, there are different types of racism – faced by Jewish, Muslim and black communities – which have varying attributes. What connects these as racisms is the common experience of discrimination, and the use of cultural pathologies and stereotypes to vilify racialised minorities for decades. We strongly urge ministers and the government to recognise that racism must be an integral part of any definition of Islamophobia.
