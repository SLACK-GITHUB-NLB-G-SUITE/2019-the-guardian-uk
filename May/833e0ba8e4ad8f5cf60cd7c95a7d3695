Will Connolly, the Australian teenager who became known as “egg boy”, says he has donated almost $100,000 to help those affected by the Christchurch mosque attack. The money has come through two GoFundMe pages that were established by other people after Connolly cracked an egg on the head of far-right senator Fraser Anning. The egging came after Fraser said the Christchurch attack highlighted “growing fear over an increasing Muslim presence” in Australian and New Zealand communities. Anning punched 17-year-old Connolly after the incident and Anning’s supporters tackled Connolly to the ground. Connolly was taken away by police and released without charge. The GoFundMe pages had been set up to raise money for legal fees but the teenager promised to donate the money to help those affected by the attack in which 51 people were killed. In an Instagram post on Monday night Connolly wrote: “Finally!!! After a huge amount of red tape, $99,922.36 has today been transferred to the Christchurch Foundation and Victims Support. “For those of you who don’t know, there were two GoFundMe pages set up to help cover the cost of my legal fees and to ‘buy more eggs’. “Gratefully, Gordon Legal acted pro-bono for me so I don’t have any legal fees. “I decided to donate all monies to help provide some relief to the victims of the massacre ... it wasn’t mine to keep. “To the victims of the tragedy, I wholeheartedly hope that this can bring some relief to you.” Finally!!! After a huge amount of red tape,$99,922.36 has today been transferred to the Christchurch Foundation and Victims Support. For those of you who don’t know, there were 2 Go Fund Me pages set up to help cover the cost of my legal fees and to ‘buy more eggs’. Gratefully, Gordon Legal acted probono for me so I don’t have any legal fees. I decided to donate all monies to help provide some relief to the victims of the massacre... it wasn’t mine to keep. I want to thank Corey and @sajjad12345 who set up the funds and every single person who donated to the money and made this possible. To the victims of the Tragedy, I whole heartedly hope that this can bring some relief to you. Keep spreading the love. ❤️🙌🏻 A post shared by  Will Connolly (@willconnolly__) on May 28, 2019 at 1:19am PDT
