The final list of runners and stall positions for Saturday’s Derby is complete following a draw ceremony at Epsom Downs racecourse, with 13 runners due to go to post including seven trained by Aidan O’Brien, who will be hoping to saddle a record-equalling seventh winner of the race. Cape Of Good Hope is the only one of O’Brien’s eight entries at the five-day stage who will miss the race, having been declared instead for the Prix du Jockey Club (French Derby) at Chantilly the following afternoon. Roger Varian’s Surfman, third behind Telecaster in the Dante Stakes, will also skip Epsom to run in France. O’Brien’s complete squad for the race, with stall numbers, is: Anthony Van Dyck (7), Broome (8), Circus Maximus (5), Japan (11), Norway (10), Sir Dragonet (13) and Sovereign (4). Telecaster, the Dante Stakes winner, was added to the field at a cost of £85,000 earlier in the week and will break from stall two, which has yet to produce a Derby winner since starting stalls were introduced in 1967. Line Of Duty, whose trainer Charlie Appleby saddled the first Derby winner in Godolphin’s royal blue colours last year, will set off alongside Telecaster from stall one, while Bangkok, who beat Telecaster in a maiden race at Doncaster earlier in the season, is in 12. Frankie Dettori will ride Circus Maximus, the Dee Stakes winner, while Ryan Moore will be aboard the likely favourite, Sir Dragonet. Circus Maximus was available at 25-1 overnight, but he is already starting to attract some support and is now priced up at between 16-1 and 20-1 with the major firms. Sir Dragonet is top-priced at 3-1. Donnacha O’Brien rides Broome (9-2), while Jamie Spencer and Wayne Lordan are aboard Norway (40-1) and Japan (10-1), respectively. Seamie Heffernan is booked for Anthony Van Dyck (7-1), who took the Lingfield Derby Trial, while Padraig Beggy, who won the Derby on 40-1 chance Wings Of Eagles two years ago, is on the outsider of the O’Brien party, Sovereign, at 100-1.

The three-year-old was a little disappointing over this course and distance last time out but that was in a Class 2 event and barely a week after a more promising performance on his handicap debut. This race is two rungs down the ladder and gives him an obvious chance to return to winning form. Rowland Ward (6.30) improved significantly to get off the mark at the fourth attempt at Doncaster in late April and should continue his progress off a 6lb higher mark, while Parknacilla (3.20) and Regimented (3.30) have obvious chances on the cards at Yarmouth and Lingfield Park, respectively.
