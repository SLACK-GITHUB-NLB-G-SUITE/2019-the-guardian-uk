A former football coach who helped launch the career of a string of household names has been found guilty of sexually abusing schoolboy players. Bob Higgins, who worked with hundreds of youngsters, was found guilty of 45 charges of indecent assault against teenage boys at Bournemouth crown court. The jury found Higgins not guilty of five counts of indecent assault and were unable to reach a verdict on the final count. The defendant showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out and he was convicted of offences against 23 victims. He was previously convicted at an earlier trial of an offence against one other victim. Judge Peter Crabtree discharged the jury and thanked them for their service. Higgins will be sentenced at a later date at Winchester crown court. More details soon â€¦
