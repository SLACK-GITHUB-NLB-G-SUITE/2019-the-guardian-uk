Kubrat Pulev has been fined, suspended and ordered to take sexual harassment prevention classes after kissing a reporter, according to reports. The Bulgarian heavyweight, 38, kissed Jennifer Ravalo without consent when she was interviewing him following his victory in March over Romania’s Bogdan Dinu in Costa Mesa, California. The California State Athletic Commission has reportedly ordered Pulev to pay a $2,500 (£1,936) fine and he has been told to attend sexual harassment prevention classes before he can fight again in the United States. Should he complete the suggested course and meet the other conditions by 22 July, he can then apply to have his boxing licence reinstated. Pulev apologised to Ravalo during Tuesday’s hearing with the commission. In the event of him resuming his career, he will also again become a potential future opponent for Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, having been linked with each before alternatives were selected for their next fights in the coming weeks.
