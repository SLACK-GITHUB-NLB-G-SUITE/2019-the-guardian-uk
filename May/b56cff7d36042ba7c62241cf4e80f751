Sergio Pérez said he came close to running over a marshal during the Monaco Grand Prix. The Mexican driver was accelerating out of the pits when two track officials ran out in front of him. Pérez had to hit the brakes as one marshal made it to the opposing side of the track, while the other stood still, so he could pass. “What was wrong with those marshals? I nearly killed him,” said Pérez over the radio. The alarming incident took place under safety car conditions – deployed following Charles Leclerc’s collision with the Renault driver Nico Hülkenberg. Leclerc sustained a rear puncture and his tyre debris littered the track. Pérez, who competes for the Racing Point team and eventually finished 13th, said: “During the safety car I nearly ran over a marshal. They were running back across the track as I was coming out of the pits. I had to brake – they were very lucky I avoided them. They’re usually very good but it is safety at the end of the day and that is what is important for the marshals and drivers.” The 29-year-old later wrote on Twitter: “After this incident I’m just very happy with the outcome of my day. That we all can go back home safe and sound with our families. For the safety of the marshals I hope it never happens again!” Pérez’s race was then compromised again, only a handful of laps later, when he was caught up in a six-car traffic jam at Rascasse. Antonio Giovinazzi tangled with the Williams driver Robert Kubica, sending the Pole into a spin. Pérez, Hülkenberg, George Russell and Leclerc all had to stop, with Kubica blocking the way. The Alfa Romeo driver Giovinazzi was handed a 10-second penalty for his role in the accident.
