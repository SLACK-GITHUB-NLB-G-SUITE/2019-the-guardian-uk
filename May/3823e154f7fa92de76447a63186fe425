The Premier League is the best league in the world again, which simply will not do as far as Spain’s big clubs are concerned. Luckily they’ve come up with a cunning plan to redress the balance: sign all the good players in England. Foolproof. They’ll never see them coming. Manchester United simply won’t be able to resist when Barcelona swoop in for Marcus Rashford. Arsenal will just stand by when the Catalan giants make off with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. Atlético Madrid want Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso. Liverpool will wave the white flag when Real Madrid snatch Mo Salah, who will be delighted to meet new teammate Sergio Ramos. Real are also closing in on Eintracht Frankfurt goal ace Luka Jovic, while Atlético are eyeing up Lacazette as a replacement for Antoine Griezmann, who’s widely expected to join Barça this summer. But maybe it isn’t going to be one-way traffic. Perhaps the Mill was too hasty. It’s not all doom and gloom. It says here that United are going to sign Thomas Partey from Atlético, who also won’t be able to keep Rodrigo away from Manchester City’s clutches. And get this: City are planning to rival Barça for Griezmann and are prepared to trigger the Frenchman’s release clause. Perhaps the Premier League will be able to stomach the loss of Alonso after all. Liverpool are planning a summer clearout. They’ll sell Marko Grujic to Hertha Berlin for £20m, while they’ll also listen to offers for Harry Wilson, Nathaniel Clyne and Simon Mignolet. United, in desperate need of some fresh blood, have contacted Bayern Munich about a deal for Robert Lewandowski, 31 in August. There’s no getting the better of the Red Devils! Ole Gunnar Solskjær also wants some new full-backs and is eyeing Crystal Palace’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka and, er, Patrick Van Aanholt. Tottenham’s Kieran Trippier is also on Solskjær’s shortlist. Newcastle want to sign Salomón Rondón from West Brom, but he’ll only make his loan move permanent if Rafa Benítez remains on Tyneside.
