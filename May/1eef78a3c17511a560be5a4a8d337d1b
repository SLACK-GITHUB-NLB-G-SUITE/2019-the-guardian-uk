Bordeaux are interested in signing Plymouth’s Ruben Lameiras at the end of the season after the former Tottenham youth team player’s impressive performances in League One this season. The 24-year-old Portuguese attacking midfielder, who left Spurs in 2015 for Coventry having spent four years in the Premier League side’s academy, has scored 11 league goals this season despite his side’s struggles at the foot of the table. Lameiras is out of contract at the end of the season having spent two years at Home Park and the French side will send a representative to Plymouth’s last match of the season against Scunthorpe on Saturday. He has been recommended to the Bordeaux manager Paulo Sousa by Tottenham’s academy director John McDermott and could follow the former Sunderland striker Josh Maja in swapping League One for Ligue 1. Kevin Nancekivell will take charge of Plymouth’s critical fixture with Scunthorpe after the manager Derek Adams was sacked on Sunday following the 5-1 thrashing by Accrington Stanley on Saturday which left them in the bottom four on goal difference.
