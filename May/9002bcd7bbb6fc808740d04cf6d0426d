Fifteen players and one member of the coaching staff from the Canada women’s national team have joined Juan Mata’s Common Goal campaign, where footballers pledge 1% of their salaries to charity. With more than 1,200 senior caps between them, the list includes the veteran goalkeeper Erin McLeod and Canada’s record goalscorer, and captain, Christine Sinclair. Common Goal started 20 months ago with Manchester United’s Mata pledging 1% of his salary to a collective fund. The movement now has close to 100 players, with near gender parity, and $1.3m (£1m) generated so far for high-impact football charities around the world. McLeod said: “When I heard about Common Goal — the social impact movement in global football where members pledge 1% of their wages to football charities — I just thought, ‘Of course. Why wouldn’t I want to be a part of this?’ Now I am extremely proud that 15 of the girls on the team have signed up and at the World Cup this summer, Canada will have the first Common Goal XI. “I won’t be there because I’m injured – it crushes my heart – but I’m so proud of the players who will be there. This is what our Canadian legacy is all about.” Adriana Leon (West Ham), Christine Sinclair (Portland Thorns), Desiree Scott (Utah Royals), Janine Beckie (Manchester City), Jenna Hellstrom (KIF Örebro), Jordyn Huitema (Chilliwack FC), Kadeisha Buchanan (Lyon), Lindsay Agnew (Houston Dash), Rebecca Quinn (Paris FC), Robyn Gayle (Cultural Manager Canada WNT), Sabrina D’Angelo (Vittsjö GIK), Shannon Woeller (Eskilstuna United), Shelina Zadorsky (Orlando Pride), Sophie Schmidt (Houston Dash), Stephanie Labbé (NC Courage), Erin McLeod (Växjö DFF).
