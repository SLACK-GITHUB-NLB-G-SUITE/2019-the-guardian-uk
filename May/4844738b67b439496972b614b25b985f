I am 44 and, until last year, had not had sex in 22 years. In my early 20s, I developed concurrent mental health and substance abuse disorders; the medications I was prescribed interfered with my sexual functioning. I had no partners, only a steady diet of pornography. Since then, I have quit smoking, alcohol, caffeine and illegal substances, and taken up a fitness programme, losing 15kg (35lb). Last year, I hooked up with a friend and colleague – miraculously ending more than two decades of celibacy. It was a bit like riding a bicycle; you never really forget it once you’ve learned. The hitch? When I lost my virginity for a second time, I discovered that I no longer enjoyed intercourse. In retrospect, I’ve realised that perhaps I never did. I find it nearly impossible to achieve orgasm from penetration, and have what is referred to as delayed ejaculation. When I do experience orgasm, it is neither intense nor pleasurable. Looking back, I have had this problem with every partner, though I’m sure that medication has made it worse. My colleague was satisfied with me as a lover, and I enjoyed prioritising her pleasure. We had a connection, but our romance ended on good terms when we both decided to move on. I think sex is important for happiness – so I want to find a way to enjoy intercourse, perhaps through therapy, and to find a partner. I just hope I don’t have to wait another 22 years. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
