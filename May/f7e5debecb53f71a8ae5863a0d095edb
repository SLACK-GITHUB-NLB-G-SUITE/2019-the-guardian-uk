Work has begun to move a Banksy artwork painted on the side of a steelworker’s garage in Port Talbot, south Wales. The Season’s Greetings mural will be removed from its site in the Taibach area before being transported to a new art museum in the town centre. On Tuesday, a team of civil engineer experts began to drill into the two external walls of the garage that the stencil is displayed on. It has already been covered in resin to stop it from cracking. The mural will be lifted from the remaining part of the garage by a crane and loaded on to a lorry on Wednesday. A police escort is expected to accompany the lorry as it takes the mural to a new art gallery at Ty’r Orsaf, a former police station recently developed into a mixed-use retail unit. The stencil, which shows a child dressed for snow playing in the falling ash and smoke from a skip fire, appeared on the side of a garage owned by Ian Lewis, a steelworker, in December. John Brandler, an Essex-based art dealer, purchased the piece for a “six-figure sum” in January before agreeing to allow it to be displayed to the public in Port Talbot for a minimum of three years. Neath Port Talbot’s council leader, Rob Jones, said: “Banksy’s artwork has certainly brought a lot of publicity for Neath Port Talbot since it arrived and we now hope many people will enjoy viewing it in its new setting.”
