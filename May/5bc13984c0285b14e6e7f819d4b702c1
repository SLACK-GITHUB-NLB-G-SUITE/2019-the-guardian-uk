A professional wrestler and actor has died after collapsing in the ring in front of fans during a bout in London. Silver King – who played a villain called Ramses in the film Nacho Libre alongside Jack Black and was a star in his native Mexico – was performing at the Roundhouse in Camden for an event titled “the Greatest Show of Lucha Libre”. The wrestler, 51, whose real name is Cesar Barron, died from a heart attack mid-performance, according to the organisers. Juventud Guerrera, also known as Youth Warrior, appeared to kick him in the side, causing Barron to fall, before turning him over to “pin” him down for the victory, footage posted online showed. His co-performers did not immediately realise the seriousness of the incident and witnesses said his opponent gestured in confusion after Barron did not stand back up as the referee urged him to return to the wresting match as he was counted out, the Camden New Journal reported. A team of medics rushed to his aid after he failed to recover and the audience were told to leave the building as Barron lay unconscious on the canvas. The London ambulance service arrived soon after being called at about 10.20pm but were unable to resuscitate the wrestler and he was pronounced dead at the scene. A member of the audience told the CNJ: “It seemed to be part of the show at first but then he didn’t get up – and then the medical team was on the stage. Everybody was cleared out and lots of police and ambulances were there.” Les comparto esta maravillosa Foto de todo el equipo antes de la lucha campal... estábamos muy felices!

Scotland Yard said police are treating his death as “non-suspicious”. Lucha Libre World, the organisers of the show, said it was sorry to confirm the death of the former World Championship Wrestling star wrestler. “César Cuauhtémoc González Barrón (AKA Silver King) suffered what we believe was a cardiac arrest while performing in the show and sadly passed away. “We have truly lost one of Lucha Libre’s greatest wrestlers and our thoughts and deepest condolences are with César’s family and his fans across the world. We will be able to make further announcements when more information becomes available.” Tributes poured in from across the world for the stricken fighter. Jack Black posted an image taken during filming on Instagram with the caption: “Vaya con dios, hermano [go with god, brother]”. César González...vaya con dios, hermano 💙 A post shared by  Jack Black (@jackblack) on May 11, 2019 at 9:06pm PDT The Canadian wrestler Chris Jericho thanked Barron on Instagram for teaching him to become a better fighter, while Mexican ‘Luchador’ El Hijo del Santo said he was “deeply saddened at the death of my great rival and companion at so many battles”, adding that Silver King “died as he wanted: fighting!”. Lucha Libre wrestling involves competitors wearing elaborate costumes and colourful masks – which they must remove if they lose a fight. The show, which features aerial athletics, acrobatics and dramatic theatrics, is performed by freestyle wresters in choreographed battles. Silver King competed in World Championship Wrestling between 1997 and 2000, taking on Juventud Guerrera for the cruiserweight championship in 1998. He grew up in a wrestling family in Torreón, northern Mexico, and his father was a popular lucha libre fighter named Dr Wagner.
