Celtic and Rangers are among the clubs looking to sign the midfielder Joe Aribo from Charlton when the 22-year-old’s contract expires in the summer . Aribo, who scored 10 goals in League One as Charlton reached the play-offs, was linked with a move to Manchester City this week and has also attracted Southampton, Bournemouth and Eintracht Frankfurt. The German side are understood to be the favourites at this stage, with the player believed to favour a move to a club where he will have realistic playing prospects. Having begun his career at non-league Staines Town after playing for the Kinetic Academy, Aribo has made significant progress at the Valley but has made it clear he has no intention of signing a contract. The former Charlton forward Ademola Lookman looks like he is on his way out of Everton this summer, with Southampton and RB Leipzig, where he spent last season on loan, leading the race for his signature. The 21-year-old made only three Premier League starts for Everton this season and will be allowed to leave for around £20m. Milan are also thought to be considering reviving their interest in Lookman having seen an approach turned down in January, while Crystal Palace have shown an interest in the player they attempted to sign in 2017.
