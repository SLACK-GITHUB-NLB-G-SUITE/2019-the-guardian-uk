No, Aditya Chakrabortty, it is not “political theatre” to throw milkshakes at people (Journal, 22 May), whoever they are. If you condone this you may as well condone the shouting of sexual abuse at females in the street – just a bit of banter, after all. I am no fan of Nigel Farage, but I don’t agree with this attitude – and I do not agree with printing a front-page picture of Farage showing the result of the assault. It simply encourages more of the same outrageous behaviour.Pam RoudSomersham, Cambridgeshire • I too was very unhappy when Boots started packaging my repeat prescription in plastic bags (Report, 18 May). After complaining last year, I was fobbed off to my local recycling systems (although the bags are not recyclable). That they have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact is just a joke.Julie GouldingManchester • Luke Turner (G2, 22 May) can have a full model railway even in a small flat. I have a Z gauge one taking up 4ft by 2ft (1:220 or a third of 00). Alternatively you can go mad and get T gauge, half the size again at 1:450. You can even get full sets in a briefcase, complete with scenery.John LoaderLeyburn, North Yorkshire • It was good to read of Mulhouse’s “retail resurrection” (21 May). An additional attraction of the town is the French national railway museum, La Cité du Train, which I visited about 20 years ago, and clearly would be worth visiting again.Michael SargentAylesbury, Buckinghamshire • You missed one (Wordsearch, 20 May)! Lomé is the capital of Togo. Or doesn’t West Africa count?Peter WaltonLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
