Blessed be the fruit. The trailer for season three of award-winning drama The Handmaid’s Tale has landed – and it answers many of the questions fans have been asking. With the tagline ‘Witness the birth of a revolution’, we see June (Elisabeth Moss) head back into Gilead to help the resistance movement, as she tries to save her daughter Hannah from growing up in the sadistic authoritarian state. Her other daughter, Nicole, appears to arrive safely in Canada. The trailer shows Emily (who escaped Gilead in a van at the climax of season two, with June staying behind) wading through rivers, hunted by Gilead state police helicopters, then we see her given a hero’s welcome. We also spy June’s husband Luke cradling the baby at a political rally. The second season of the adaptation of the Margaret Atwood dystopia was criticised for feeling increasingly like torture porn, with some also frustrated by its inconclusive denouement. The third outing looks set to lower the violence levels, and focus instead on the emotional turmoil of the growing network of resistance fighters and rebels of the state. Will they rise up – or will June and her allies end up on the Wall for heresy? The Handmaid’s Tale returns on 5 June in the US and at a later date TBC in the UK.
