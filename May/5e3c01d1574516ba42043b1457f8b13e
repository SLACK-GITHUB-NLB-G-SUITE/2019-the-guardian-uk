The first teaser trailer for Terminator: Dark Fate has been released online. This is the sixth film in the Terminator series, which began in 1984 with the James Cameron-directed The Terminator. Dark Fate has been pitched as a sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day, thereby ignoring all four subsequent films, including the most recent, Terminator: Genysis, released in 2015. Genysis failed to break even, and Dark Fate represents an attempt to reinvigorate the franchise, with Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor) and Arnold Schwarzenegger returning in substantial roles alongside Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes. Cameron is acting as producer, with Tim Miller (Deadpool) directing. Terminator: Dark Fate is due for release on 23 October in the UK, 31 October in Australia, and 1 November in the US.
