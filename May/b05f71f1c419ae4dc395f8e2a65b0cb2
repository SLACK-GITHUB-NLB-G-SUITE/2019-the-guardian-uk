The proposed takeover of Bolton Wanderers by the former Watford owner Laurence Bassini is off after the club issued a statement saying “no further discussions will be entered into on the matter with him”. Bassini had requested 48 hours to complete his funding package on Tuesday before presenting it to the English Football League on Thursday, but Bolton say no such presentation was made. “Given the urgency of the situation, which has been expressed to Mr Bassini, we now consider his approach for the club at an end and no further discussions will be entered into on the matter with him,” read a Bolton statement. The club have said that Ken Anderson, the current owner of the club, will consult his advisers and consider the best course of action as a matter of urgency. They also claimed that Bassini had not taken up an offer to carry out due diligence in the club’s data room.

Bolton were due to play the match last weekend but it was postponed after Bolton’s first-team squad went on strike over unpaid wages. The EFL announced on Wednesday that Bolton’s players were available to play Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Sunday. Now Bolton, already relegated to League One, will face Brentford on Tuesday, two days after the regular Championship season ends. However, in the event of the club entering administration, they will not have to fulfil their final fixture.
