The absence of star names has turned this year’s 2,000 Guineas into a real puzzle for punters but the answer could be Madhmoon (3.35), from the yard of Kevin Prendergast, who last won this colt’s Classic with Nebbiolo in 1977. Fast ground seems likely at Newmarket, despite Friday’s showers, and that will be this colt’s cup of tea, as he looked flashy on a sound surface last year. He was spinning his wheels on soft ground at Leopardstown last month but still ran well and is expected to be a lot sharper for that, so 8-1 is fine. Of the rest, Ten Sovereigns is quick but a mile might stretch him and Magna Grecia looks more of a threat. Then again, it was a bunched finish when that one won the Futurity and Great Scot may turn the tables, if he settles a bit better than he was doing last year. He made up a huge amount of ground before tiring in that race and his Greenham Stakes second was promising, so he makes some each-way appeal at 16-1. 1.50 Newmarket These conditions look ideal for Jazeel, who likes a strong pace and fast ground, which helped him win the Silver Cambridgeshire here in September. Having since joined the in-form Jedd O’Keeffe, he looks the pick, though Al Muffrih is unexposed on this first run since June. 2.05 Goodwood Now that the William Haggas team seems to be hitting its stride, Klassique appeals most here. She came close to a Group Three success in France in October, when outpaced close home by one of Andre Fabre’s runners, and looks very progressive. 2.20 Newmarket Three-year-olds have become a rarity in the Palace House Stakes but they had a strong record at one time and Sergei Prokofiev can revive those memories. A ball of fire who had trouble staying six furlongs last year, he was nonetheless third in a strong Coventry Stakes and his Navan return seemed to show he was becoming more tractable. He could do without much rain. 2.40 Goodwood Mark Johnston likes winning at this track and his Love Dreams made all here when winning last May off a 7lb higher mark. A spell in the doldrums followed but his close second at Kempton last time was his best run since. Qaroun might not get the best of runs here from a wide stall. 2.55 Newmarket Another chance is given to the Haggas-trained Young Rascal, who may have needed the run when disappointing in the John Porter Stakes. He should be too good for Coronet, while Defoe would prefer some cut.
