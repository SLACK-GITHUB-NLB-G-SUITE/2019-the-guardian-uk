We welcome the idea of a major review of inequality (Britain ‘risks heading to US levels of inequality’, 14 May). With Brexit looming and recent analyses linking income inequality to voting for rightwing populists, mass shootings, mental ill health, status consumerism and domestic violence, this is indeed a critical issue for our times. However, there is widespread concern about the composition of this review’s “expert panel”, which has a majority of white economists. Although the panel includes an expert on health inequalities, none of the world’s leading experts on the health and psychosocial effects of income inequality itself are included, nor is there expertise in the spatial aspects of inequality. And there is a conspicuous absence of world-leading economists for whom income inequality is their primary focus – no Piketty, no Stiglitz, no Galbraith, no Frank, no Fitoussi, no Palma, no Chang, no Milanovic. Sir Angus Deaton, leading the review, stated in the journal Science in 2014 that he “get[s] angry” about the theory that inequality has psychological and social effects on health – perhaps he has changed his mind now that his own research has uncovered rising deaths from addiction and suicide in the US, but there are many researchers with much greater depth in this area. Even more troubling, there is no ethnic minority representation on the “expert panel”, no people with lived experience of inequality, no representatives of charities, trade unions or other NGOs. The number of disciplines represented is also small, although the impact of inequality goes far beyond economics. We, and others, have been researching, educating and campaigning on inequality for many years, we understand the issues and we know what needs to be done. We cannot wait five years for a report from a worryingly elitist review. Getting policymakers and politicians to tackle inequality will require grassroots support from those most affected and is needed urgently.

They were accused of grabbing more than their share of the “national cake”. Fifty years on, the share of the national cake that goes to the workers who produce it has declined from roughly 70% to 50%; the rest goes to shareholders as unearned income. The IFS Deaton review will consider how this has come about, but surely it is evident that this has been the project of Thatcherism, with its legislation against the rights of workers and their trade unions. The Blair-Brown governments failed to reverse this and sought to mask its effects by boosting state benefits to working families. The review will investigate inequality and the “aspects of it [that] are perceived to be fair and unfair”. But the Brexit debate has shown how easy it is to build perceptions of unfairness, with talk of bullying bureaucracies and metropolitan elites. It’s not difficult to set up oppositions between south and north, or between young and old. Until the balance between workers and shareholders is shifted back in workers’ favour, inequality and the dangers of populist political rhetoric can only grow.David SangBrighton • It is hardly surprising that two nations whose development has been driven by financial gain and greed share a common trend of growing inequality. It is inevitable that countries like the UK and US that measure success by economic growth will always favour those who already have wealth. In the circumstances it seems unfathomable that it needs five years to conclude that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Ian MitchellPreston • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
