The Spice Girl Mel B has said she hopes the sound “will be much, much better” at the reformed band’s next show, following complaints about the first gig of their stadium reunion tour. More than 70,000 fans attended the concert at Croke Park in Dublin on Friday night, many of whom paid more than £100 to see the pop group take the stage for the first time in seven years. However, footage posted on social media showed that many could barely hear the hit songs. One wrote: There’s something wrong when the crowd at @spicegirls concert are all sitting down because no one has a clue what song is on because the sound really is THAT bad. @mcd_productions @CrokePark @IrishTimes @LovinDublin #SpiceWorldTour #SpiceGirl pic.twitter.com/QkENc7BJ8Y While another said: Sorry @spicegirls but we cannot hear a thing sitting here in @CrokePark - sound is AWFUL!!!! pic.twitter.com/XD28tbidCX In an Instagram post, Melanie Brown thanked everyone for attending but admitted the sound quality was poor. “We will see you in Cardiff,” she said. “And hopefully the vocals and the sound will be much, much better, pfft.” However, many fans closer to the stage hailed an “amazing show”. The 1990s band opened the concert with the message: “We welcome all ages, all races, all gender identities, all countries of origin, all sexual orientations, all religions and beliefs, all abilities.” Geri Horner greeted the crowd saying: “Welcome to Spice World. Spice girls, spice boys, everyone is welcome. We want every single one of you to feel special tonight. Like a king or a queen, we celebrate you. But I got to say, there are a lot of queens here tonight.”
