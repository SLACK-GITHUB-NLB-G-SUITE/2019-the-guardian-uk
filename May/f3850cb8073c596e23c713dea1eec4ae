Voters in the European Union’s 28 member states go to the polls between 23 and 26 May 2019 to elect a new European parliament.With just days remaining before elections take place there is a battle going on for the continent’s soul between the pro-European mainstream and resurgent far-right, populist and EU critical parties. Despite its critics, polls show the EU’s popularity is at a 30-year high. Across Europe, Brexit appears to barely have an impact on the upcoming elections. Unlike in the UK, most of Europe’s populists now favour an EU remodelled as a “Europe of nations”, with focus on security, immigration and “nation first” economics rather than leaving the union altogether. EU-critical parties could become the second-largest force in the parliament, with up to 35% of its 751 seats. But what are the hopes for the upcoming elections where you live?
