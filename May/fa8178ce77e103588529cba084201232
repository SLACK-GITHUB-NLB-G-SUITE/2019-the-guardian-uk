WH Smith has been rated the UK’s worst high street retailer for the second year in a row, as shoppers criticised its untidy stores and poor value for money. The books and stationery store came bottom of a survey of Which? readers, who marked it below the ailing Homebase/Bunnings DIY chain and Sports Direct. The best-ranked chains were the electrical goods store Richer Sounds, the clothing business Rohan and the department store John Lewis. WH Smith has finished last in Which’s poll – which this year asked 7,700 shoppers to rate their experience in buying non-grocery items at 100 major retailers – for six of the past nine years, and it was second-worst for the other three. This year, the survey was carried out only among Which? members, whereas previously it involved the general public. One shopper said “Stores are crowded, dirty and the staff unhelpful”, while another said “my local store is untidy and too small for comfort”. An anonymous WH Smith watcher, who – as @WHS_Carpet – regularly tweets pictures of messy aisles, non-bargain prices and worn flooring to more than 24,000 followers, said: “There have been some improvements in certain locations, but the overall high street scenario is one of staff being hamstrung by more redundancies and cuts in hours.” Despite sales falls, WH Smith said its high street chain had produced its second-best performance in the past 10 years in 2018. “This survey accounts for the views of only 586 Which? subscribers and is neither statistically relevant nor meaningful relative to our loyal customer base,” the company said. “Every week, we serve 3 million customers in our 600 UK high street stores and have maintained our presence on the high street where many other retailers are closing stores. We work hard to improve customer experiences and continue to invest in new and existing stores.”
