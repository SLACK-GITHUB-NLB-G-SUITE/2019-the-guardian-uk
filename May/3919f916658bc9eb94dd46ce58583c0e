Police in Germany are investigating the mysterious discovery of three bodies shot with crossbow bolts in a Bavarian hotel room. Investigators are still trying to determine the relationship between the three, found dead on Saturday, and what exactly happened in the room in a Passau hotel near the Austrian border. The police spokesman Stefan Gaisbauer said there were no indications that anyone other than those found dead had been involved, but it was not yet clear what had happened. “We assume that no other people were involved in the deaths,” Gaisbauer said, adding that autopsy results were expected on Tuesday. The dead, a 53-year-old man and two women aged 33 and 30, were all German citizens. The man and the older woman were from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in south-western Germany, while the younger woman was last registered as living in Wittingen in Lower Saxony, in the north of the country. Police did not release further details on the identities of the three. Their bodies were found at the hotel on Saturday morning by an employee who opened the door to their three-bed room when they did not respond to repeated knocking. The man and the older woman were lying together in bed, while the younger woman was lying on the floor. All three bodies had bolts inside them, but police did not say how many. Two crossbows were found on Saturday. Police said a third, unused crossbow was found inside a bag on Monday. Crossbows can be purchased legally in Germany by anyone over 18.
