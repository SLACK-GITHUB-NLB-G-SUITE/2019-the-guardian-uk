Uefa has announced its ticket pricing and policy for next summer’s Euro 2020 tournament, which is to be staged in 12 different cities across the continent. European football’s governing body has pledged that 82% of the tickets will be made available to supporters and the general public, and that one million tickets across the 44 matches will be priced at €50 or less. Uefa says a total of 40,000 tickets under €100 will be available for the semi-finals and final in London, but a category one ticket for the final at Wembley will cost €945. The first phase of ticket sales will run from 12 June to 12 July, with 1.5m tickets being put on sale at this point. For all matches and categories where demand exceeds supply, tickets will be allocated by a ballot. Every applicant will have the same chance of being successful, irrespective of when the application has been made between 12 June and 12 July. A second phase will follow in December 2019, after the finals draw has taken place. Finally, there will be a third phase in April 2020 when the final four places have been decided by the play-offs.
