As if this country hasn’t had enough opprobrium dumped on its poor, benighted head, now the United Nations has decided to belabour us with its nailed cudgel. Commenting last week on the air quality in Britain, a UN special representative on human rights and the environment chose to label us a “laggard and a scofflaw”. Laggard I get, but scofflaw? Nope, never heard it before. US slang, it is defined as a person who habitually flouts or violates the law, especially one who fails to pay debts or answer summonses. I don’t know about you, but I find that a touch strong, almost verging on the defamatory. Another new word crossed my path last week – paraprosdokian – a figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence, phrase or larger discourse is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. For example, “I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it” – Groucho Marx and: “I don’t belong to an organised political party. I’m a Democrat” – Will Rogers. As it’s not the most pronounceable of words, I can’t see me bunging it lightly into conversation, but I’m glad to have made its acquaintance. Finally, a story that, while strictly speaking has nothing to do with language, deserves repeating. It comes from an obituary of long-time Daily Mirror journalist John Knight, a noted bon vivant of Fleet Street. He once went on a three-day lunch and on his return to the office was asked where he had been. “On the piss,” he replied. “Oh thank goodness for that,” said his editor. “We were worried in case you were ill.” Ah, truly those were halcyon days. • Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist
