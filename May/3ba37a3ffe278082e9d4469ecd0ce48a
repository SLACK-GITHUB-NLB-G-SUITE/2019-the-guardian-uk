Rose Matafeo’s Horndog. Seeing a young woman of colour talking about love, life and cry-dancing to K-pop was the icing. Trust me, that motherfucker makes one hell of a cake! SNL’s Friendos sketch – toxic masculinity and talk therapy have never been sillier. Silicon Valley, specifically anything Jared does, followed by Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Airplane.
