The Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy has been named the UK’s richest young sports star for the third year running, increasing his fortune by £28m to £138m, in an all-male list dominated by Premier League footballers. He topped the 17-strong list ahead of the Real Madrid and Wales footballer Gareth Bale, whose fortune grew a £20m to £94m. Bale moved up a spot because Andy Murray, 31, did not feature on this year’s list. Only UK-based sports stars aged 30 and under are eligible for inclusion. McIlroy enjoyed the biggest boost to his personal fortune of all the stars on the list, with his tournament earnings bolstered by an estimated £25m annually from commercial deals. McIlroy has $100m, 10-year contracts with Nike and the golf equipment maker TaylorMade, as well as deals with Omega watches and NBC Sports. Of the top 17 highest earning sportspeople that comprise the list, 15 are footballers. There are no women on the list. In March, McIlroy won the Players Championship, the biggest tournament on the PGA Tour joining Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win four majors and 15 PGA Tour titles before the age of 30. McIlroy reportedly made a small loss on the recent sale of his mansion in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. While he boosted his fortune with the $11.5m sale of the waterfront property – for which he had been asking $12.9m – he paid $11.75m for it and a vacant lot next door in 2012. The only other non-footballer to feature on the list was the boxing world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, whose wealth rose £14m to £49m, ranking him fourth. Joshua is estimated to have made about £15m from his fight against the Russian boxer Alexander Povetkin in September. The Watford-born 29-year-old also earns about £7m annually from sponsors including Jaguar, Lynx and Lucozade. Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero ranked third, up £10m to £58m, with Arsenal’s Mesut Özil in fifth, as his fortune rose £14m to £42m. There were three new entrants on the Sunday Times Rich List ranking of young sports stars. The Manchester City player Raheem Sterling, 24, entered at 15th with an £18m fortune. He signed a new contract with the club worth £300,000 a week in November. The Tottenham Hotspur star and England captain, Harry Kane, debuted at 16th, on £16m, equal with the third debutant, Romelu Lukaku of Manchester United. Sports stars accounted for just over a third – 17 out of 50 places – of the overall Young Rich List where everyone has a minimum worth of £16m. 1. Rory McIlroy, golfer, £138m (up £28m on 2018) 2.
