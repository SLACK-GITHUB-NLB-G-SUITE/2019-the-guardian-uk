I have had an invitation to my niece’s wedding that includes a note saying she hopes my partner and I will attend so she can “start to get to know her only uncle”. She is 27 and my brother’s eldest child, but I have seen her only twice. My brother cut contact after I came out to him 40 years ago and has ignored my efforts to reconnect. I don’t believe my brother’s attitude has changed and I don’t feel this public occasion is right for any attempt at reconciliation. But my partner feels that to refuse would scupper hope of any future relationship.
