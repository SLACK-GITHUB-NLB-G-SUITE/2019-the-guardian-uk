A fascinating race for the Punchestown Gold Cup on Wednesday was understandably overshadowed by the emotional farewell to Ruby Walsh that followed, but an outstanding renewal of the Festival meeting’s Champion Hurdle should have the stage all to itself on Friday evening as Apple’s Jade, Buveur D’Air, Supasundae and Melon go to post. Three of the four are Grade One winners already: seven times in the case of Buveur D’Air, including two Champion Hurdles at Cheltenham, and 10 for Apple’s Jade, including a record-breaking 16-length success in the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown in February. Supasundae, meanwhile, beat Buveur D’Air in the Grade One Aintree Hurdle just four weeks ago and took this race 12 months ago. They are currently priced up at 15-8, 2-1 and 11-2 respectively but there are reasons to doubt all three and at the odds on offer, it may be worth taking 7-1 that Melon (5.30) finally registers a first Grade One win this evening. Buveur D’Air has not been at his best since winning the Fighting Fifth Hurdle in November, while Apple’s Jade, who gets the 7lb mares’ allowance, skipped Aintree before winning at this meeting last year. This time around, she had a hard race when finishing third over three miles, which may have taken the edge off her, while Supasundae is probably better over further. Melon has little chance of beating Apple’s Jade on their Leopardstown form in February but he was less than a length behind Buveur D’Air in the 2018 Champion Hurdle and has run well at this meeting in each of the last two seasons. He fell three out in last year’s renewal of this race when he was travelling every bit as well – and arguably rather better – than the eventual winner. He has been lightly raced since and fell three out when upped to two-and-a-half-mile at Aintree but this looks like his ideal track and trip and 7-1 looks a decent price overall. On the British cards, Oloroso (3.35) should return to winning form at Lingfield after a solid performance last time out in a race that was not run to suit, while Charles Molson (3.05) is now 10lb below his last winning mark and looks sure to go well half an hour earlier. Poet’s Magic (2.45) and Splash Of Verve (6.55) look best at Chepstow and Newcastle respectively.
