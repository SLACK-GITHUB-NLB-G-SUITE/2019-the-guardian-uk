It is testament to the growing strength of the women’s game that a side as decent as Denmark have failed to qualify for this summer’s tournament. The beaten finalists at Euro 2017 lost again here, but were frequently the better team and succeeded in highlighting England’s new-found defensive disorganisation. Surely not. Phil Neville’s side improved significantly when Karen Carney and Fran Kirby came on and they switched to 4-2-3-1, with Jill Scott dropping deeper alongside Jade Moore in central midfield. Significantly, Kirby, Carney and the withdrawn Georgia Stanway relish deployment in the No 10 role, which a pure 4-3-3 is not designed to accommodate. Granted, the somewhat lucky Lionesses found a way to win, but if they are as slapdash in possession as this in France, England will struggle to reach the last eight, let alone the final four. The absence of the rested Steph Houghton and Lucy Bronze was keenly felt and the narrowness of the initial formation invited Denmark’s full-backs to attack, while tight marking negated the first-half influence of Moore. A disjointed England often looked half a yard off the pace. Could they be jaded after recently completing their first full winter season following the WSL’s switch from a summer game? Perhaps significantly, Japan, one of the Lionesses’ group-stage opponents in France, and the US, the World Cup holders, kicked off their respective domestic campaigns in March. Might teams with fresher legs come to the forefront this summer? Although the Karens, Bardsley and Carney, and Beth Mead impressed, Scott was England’s best player in Walsall. Her knack of making late, catalytic, runs into the box could prove invaluable next month and, from one such manoeuvre, she headed the second goal. Earlier, Scott’s driving run and beautifully weighted through pass almost created a goal for Ellen White.
