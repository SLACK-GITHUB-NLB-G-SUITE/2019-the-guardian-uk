A ballot paper marked with the word “Brexit” and a large arrow across the page pointing to the Conservative candidate has been ruled to be a vote for a councillor who won by a majority of one. The Cotswold district councillor Stephen Hirst held his seat in Tetbury town after his majority was originally contested. The council’s returning officer said: “Prior to the final adjudication on the doubtful papers, the number of votes for the Conservative candidate and the independent candidate were level. “However, when adjudicating on those ‘doubtful’ papers, the returning officer awarded one additional vote to the Conservative candidate, having regard to the guidance contained in the Electoral Commission’s booklet on doubtful papers and examples within election law books.” Guidance from the Electoral Commission states that a ballot paper can be rejected if the voter’s intention is uncertain but not if it is not marked in the proper place or other than by a cross or by more than one mark. The council’s new Tory leader of the opposition, Tony Berry, said: “We have tonight lost control of [the] council. “Not, I don’t think, for any other reason than the fact that there is an awful lot of rubbish going on at the top level of politics, a lot of people not turning out to vote, putting in votes which are basically to show that they’re not happy with what’s going on at the moment.” Across the country, election results were delayed overnight after people deliberately spoiled their ballot papers in protest at the Brexit delay. On Twitter, leave voters shared their spoiled ballots using the hashtag “#SpoilYourBallot”. On trend with the countrywide surge for smaller parties, the formerly Tory-run council lost out to the Liberal Democrats by four seats. The makeup of the council is now 18 for the Liberal Democrats, 14 for the Conservatives, one Green and one independent.
