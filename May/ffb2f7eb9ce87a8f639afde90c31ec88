ITV has suspended filming and broadcasts of The Jeremy Kyle Show after the death of a guest who appeared on the programme. The broadcaster said it would not screen the episode in which the person took part. “Everyone at ITV and The Jeremy Kyle Show is shocked and saddened at the news of the death of a participant in the show a week after the recording of the episode they featured in and our thoughts are with their family and friends,” a spokesperson said. “ITV will not screen the episode in which they featured. Given the seriousness of this event, ITV has also decided to suspend both filming and broadcasting of The Jeremy Kyle Show with immediate effect in order to give it time to conduct a review of this episode of the show.” The Jeremy Kyle Show launched in 2005 as the UK’s answer to America’s Jerry Springer Show. Guests discuss personal conflicts and relationship problems in front of a studio audience. In 2014, the regulator Ofcom criticised the show for not doing enough to prevent the distress and humiliation of a 17-year-old guest who was called a “crackhead” and a “silly anorexic slapper” by her older sister.
