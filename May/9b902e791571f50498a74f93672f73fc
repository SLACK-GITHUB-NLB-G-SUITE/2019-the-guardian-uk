Judith Kerr, the author behind some of the best loved children’s books such as the series with Mog the cat, has died at the age of 95. Over a 50-year career she published more than 30 further books, immortalising a succession of family cats and bringing to life her family’s flight across Europe as the Nazis came to power in the novel When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. Kerr was born in 1923 into the intelligentsia of interwar Berlin before settling in England in 1936, and only started publishing in her 40s. She lived to see the Tiger in The Tiger Who Came to Tea reach its millionth sale as she turned 94. To her mild chagrin, it remained her best loved single book. (“I’ve got better at drawing, obviously” she told one interviewer.) We’d like you to tell us what Kerr meant to you. Perhaps you or your children met her or her books have had an impact on you.
