My boyfriend and I are at a crossroads. He has had severe anxiety for more than 20 years, although he has sought help and is open to more. He will only go somewhere if he is driving, but never further than a 90-minute journey because he worries in case he has a panic attack while away from home. This limits what we can do together. I am in my 30s and would like a child. I know he would make a wonderful father, but I am concerned about the impact of this upon family life. What do we do?
