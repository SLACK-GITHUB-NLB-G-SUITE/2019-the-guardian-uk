Every Sunday morning, Rye Lane in Peckham, in the London borough of Southwark, becomes filled with groups of worshippers wearing white robes. Photographer Sophie Green, who lives in the area, was enchanted by these figures, spilling in and out of the local Aladura spiritualist African churches. Aladura, which means “praying people” in Yoruba, is a denomination of Christianity characterised by its adherents’ flowing white garments, symbolising tradition, spiritual cleanliness and uniformity. Southwark has the highest concentration of African churches outside the continent itself. On a Sunday in 2016, Green stopped one of the women in the street to compliment her on her dress; the woman invited her to attend the seven-hour service, which involved singing, dancing and group prayer. Over the following two years, Green got to know the pastors and congregations, organising dance and photography workshops for the children and young worshippers. During this time, she photographed the community and the project is now collected in a book, Congregation. “I wanted my photographs to intimately demonstrate the beauty of these churches,” says Green. The photo above was taken during the harvest festival, an annual event that takes place in late September: the churches invite friends and family to socialise and enjoy traditional African food such as jollof rice and beef stews, while the surrounding streets become flooded with people. After a long day in church, the children gathered to buy ice cream and Green snapped the girls as they queued up outside the van. “It was so perfect; they were just chatting among themselves and it was such a simple and natural shot,” she says. “I find it an interesting image because in many ways it allows you to see where traditions and culture dovetail. Seeing churchgoers outside the context of the church is unusual – the beautiful clothing is at odds with the urban streets.” Congregation by Sophie Green is out now (Loose Joints, £27)
