Neil Warnock wants to help Cardiff find his successor after agreeing to remain with the club for another season. Warnock will see out the final year of his contract in the Championship following Cardiff’s relegation from the Premier League. The 70-year-old met the chairman, Mehmet Dalman, and chief executive, Ken Choo, for talks on Monday when it was agreed that he would continue in a job he has held since October 2016. “When you get relegated the manager’s position is usually in doubt,” Warnock told BBC Radio Wales. “But Vincent [Tan, Cardiff’s owner] made it clear last week that he wanted me to stay, and how can you not want to when you see how the fans have been with me over the last couple of years? “It rankles a little bit that we got relegated. I just feel it’s not the time to change with the squad I’ve got and the players I want to bring in. But we’ve got to obviously look for a replacement for me now. I would like to think we could do well and I can help them in that selection.” Warnock has won a record eight promotions in his 40-year managerial career, the last one coming at Cardiff in the 2017-18 campaign. He said the target of winning a ninth promotion next season was “driving me on again”. “I feel we’ve got more chance of attaining success by keeping things how they are and adding to the squad with two or three players,” he said.
