Brenton Tarrant has been charged by New Zealand police with engaging in a “terrorist act”, in addition to existing murder charges over the two mosque attacks in Christchurch in March. The Australian man, who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the shooting deaths of 51 people, was previously charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 counts of attempted murder, though New Zealand police said other charges were under consideration. Police met with more than 200 people, including survivors of the 15 March Christchurch attack and the families of victims to inform them of the new charges. “A charge of engaging in a Terrorist Act under section 6A of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 has now been filed against Brenton Tarrant,” said a statement from New Zealand police. “The charge will allege that a terrorist act was carried out in Christchurch on 15 March 2019 and follows consultation between Police, Crown Law and the Christchurch Crown Solicitors Office.” An additional murder charge and two additional attempted murder charges were also filed against him, meaning the suspect will face 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression Act. The 15 March was the worst mass shooting by a lone gunman in the country and prompted sweeping reforms to New Zealand gun laws. The country’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern, along with French president Emmanuel Macron, also met to discuss a plan, named the “Christchurch Call”, to eliminate terrorist and violent content online.
