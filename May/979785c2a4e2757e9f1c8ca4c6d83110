An Australian DJ, Adam Neat, has died in Bali after reportedly crashing through a glass door while trying to help a stricken friend. The 42-year-old, known professionally as Adam Sky, died while trying to help a friend who had suffered several broken bones on the Indonesian island on Saturday, his management has confirmed. “Relatives and friends of Adam are travelling to Bali and handling all arrangements,” a statement to the producer’s Facebook page said. It asked for privacy for the family while they came to terms with the “tragic loss”. Nine News reported that local police believe Neat had crashed through a glass door at Hillstone Villas resort, sliced his arm and died of blood loss. He had been rushing to help a friend, understood to be his Russian assistant Zoia Lukiantceva, who had fallen several metres from a private pool area and broken her leg, Nine said. Local police said alcohol was involved, Nine reported. Neat’s website said he was a “powerhouse” of the dance music scene in Asia and was ranked the third most popular DJ in the continent. The Singapore-based artist has worked with the global stars David Guetta and Afrojack. Tributes on Neat’s Facebook said he was kind and caring, while one woman described him as “one of the kindest bosses I’ve had, always friendly and understanding”. The DJ’s father, the former ABC journalist and business leader Gary Neat, was reportedly travelling to Bali on Sunday night. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian man who had died in Bali but for privacy reasons it was unable to provide further details.
