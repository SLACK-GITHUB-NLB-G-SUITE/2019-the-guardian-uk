Paul Brown is spot-on in his criticism of how weather forecasts and presenters ignore the continuing drought (Weatherwatch, 28 May). It is as if they are in a parallel universe where the climate emergency does not exist. Wildlife, gardeners, farmers and all who care about the environment are desperate for proper rainfall, especially in central and southern England. Having complained about this on numerous occasions to the BBC, I have given up as nothing changes. Presenters continue to welcome hot and dry weather, and often refer disparagingly to “the risk of rain”. Most forecasts give the impression that broadcasters do not understand the climate emergency, or they don’t care. How about taking on board messages from experts like David Attenborough in their own programmes and reflecting the reality of drought conditions in many parts of England? Presenters cannot change the weather, but their lack of coverage of the urgent need for rainfall goes beyond irritating – it is a dereliction of duty.Linda LennardSt Albans • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
