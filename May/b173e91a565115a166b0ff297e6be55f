The American writer-director Sarah Daggar-Nickson makes a seriously impressive debut here with her feminist domestic-abuse revenge fantasy featuring a lean performance by Olivia Wilde as Sadie, a lone-wolf vigilante who helps mostly female victims of abuse to escape using considerable force and asking for nothing in return but a little cash or food. It’s tough, tense movie with a couple of bone-snappingly violent moments, but critically it dials down the exploitation. You don’t have to sit through gratuitous assaults on women. This is a film rich with the texture of real life, shot in cold, grey wintry upstate New York where business is booming for Sadie. Disguised in a blond wig she poses as an insurance rep at the home of a controlling husband – a scary guy with ramrod posture wearing a crisp, creaseless white shirt. After a few minutes with Sadie, the shirt is covered in blood. So, too, is the keyboard of his computer as he transfers two-thirds of his life savings to his wife. After escorting him to the front door, Sadie returns to her scummy motel room. Next, with auburn hair and painted-on freckles she rescues two boys from their sadistic mother. You could imagine Netflix making this into a series, with each case teased out into an episode. What were the forces that shaped Sadie into an avenging angel? The answer lies in hikes she takes through the Adirondack mountains. But the more the movie explains, the less powerful it becomes – ending with a Shining-like finale in the snow that for me was a letdown. Until this point, A Vigilante’s naturalism and the terror of its lifelike high-stakes scenarios gave it real force and purpose.
