We are writers. We are your writers, the United Kingdom’s writers. We write the TV shows on UK screens and the books on UK shelves. We are part of the bubbling soup of the creative industries – along with games, film, theatre and the rest – which together are worth £10m an hour to this country. In fact, the UK publishes more books per head than any other nation on Earth, and millions of UK citizens believe they will one day join us and write the book they have inside them – and lots of them will. That is possible in part because books printed here, in English, can be sold into Europe as easily as at home. Exports account for 60% of UK publishing revenues, and 36% of physical book exports go to Europe, and that is only the most straightforward concern about what will happen. It’s fashionable among politicians to sneer at the creative industries, but our work is work just like anyone else’s, and like anyone else’s it can only happen if we get paid. Without any idea of what Brexit might look like, it’s impossible to know exactly what we might lose. A tenth? A fifth? A third of what we live on? We’ll have to make compromises. Should we ditch part of the beginning, the middle, or the end of the story? Would audiences prefer not to know whose fault it all is, how the crime was solved, or who’s still standing at the end? In TV it’s even starker; rules on tax funding for production could mean we’re simply excluded from projects filming in Europe. And that’s already happening as companies – from the US and elsewhere, not just from the EU – prepare for Brexit. It’s not just writers. It’s whole crews: carpenters, props, sparks and riggers. It’s our globally renowned visual effects industry being thrown on the fire. It seems to us that the same question is facing every industry and every person in the UK: what will you choose to lose? Because we used to hear about the advantages of Brexit. We used to hear about the bright future, the extra money, the opportunities. Now the advocates of Brexit just assure us that it won’t be as bad as the last world war. What will we choose to lose from the NHS? Apart from one in 10 doctors and thousands of nurses? What will the north-east choose to lose? Apart from 10,000 jobs already. What will the British car industry choose to lose? Apart from Honda and Nissan and the other companies which have already gone. What will science choose to lose? Apart from funding, staff and investment? What will farming choose to lose? Apart from 97% of our export market for lamb, and this summer’s fruit crop. We are the people who spend our lives making things that are not true seem believable, and we don’t think Brexit is even a good effort. In the elections for the European parliament, and the referendum which seems almost inevitable, we want to urge everyone to vote to stay in the EU – unless they know what they are choosing to lose, for themselves and everyone they know, and are happy with that. We choose a better environment, better healthcare, better food, more working protections, bigger markets, more jobs. We choose friendship and peace and better days. We choose Europe.Nick HarkawaySuw Charman-AndersonNeil GaimanLaurie PennyWarren EllisEmma KennedyJohn le CarréPhilip PullmanCharles ArthurRobert HarrisDr Sue BlackKieron GillenJoe AbercrombieSamuel WestProf Kate WilliamsSam BakerDr Helen CzerskiNikesh ShuklaDr Sunny SinghMolly FlattSarah HilaryIrenosen OkojieTade ThompsonBen LyttletonPaul CornellAndy DiggleMax PorterSarah PinboroughRob WilliamsEd JamesPaul BurstonSimon SpurrierAl EwingEmma NewmanTom HunterAdrian TchaikovskyProf Adam RobertsRobert ShearmanAdam ChristopherProf David AndressJames HenryMike CareyJon Courtenay GrimwoodGaia VinceDavid BarnettAlex PaknadelJames SmytheMartyn WaitesDr Una McCormackSteve MosbyProf Roger LuckhurstChrissy WilliamsClaire NorthDave HutchinsonKim CurranBarbara NadelJulia CrouchJuliet E McKennaDen PatrickJill DawsonDan WattersSydney MooreSophia McDougallNeil BroadfootDaragh CarvilleAnne CharnockAl RobertsonLesley ThomsonJaine FennDr Mark BlacklockJo BakerE.
