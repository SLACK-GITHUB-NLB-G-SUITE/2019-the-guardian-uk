A British soldier has died while on anti-poaching operations in Malawi, the Ministry of Defence has said. It is understood Mathew Talbot, of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, was on a patrol when he was killed by an elephant. He was on his first operational deployment when he died on 5 May, according to the MoD. The company commander, Maj Richard Wright, said in the short time he knew Talbot “he never failed to make me smile”. He said: “A true Coldstreamer, fit, energetic and full of selfless commitment, Guardsman Talbot bravely lost his life whilst ensuring that endangered species will be around for future generations to learn from and enjoy.” He leaves behind his parents and two sisters, as well as his girlfriend, Wright added. The defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said: “I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Guardsman Mathew Talbot, who died while carrying out vital counter-poaching work in Malawi. “This tragic incident is a reminder of the danger our military faces as they protect some of the world’s most endangered species from those who seek to profit from the criminal slaughter of wildlife. “Throughout his career with the Coldstream Guards, Guardsman Talbot served with great courage and professionalism, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones at this terrible time.”
