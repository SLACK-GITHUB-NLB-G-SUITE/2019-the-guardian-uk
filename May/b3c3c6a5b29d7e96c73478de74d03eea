Can you help me with a problem? NatWest has frozen my bank account and is now refusing to allow me to switch to a rival bank. Like other readers you have featured in the past, I got a letter saying that my account would be closed in a couple of weeks, and no explanation was offered. I have previously worked in Iraq, but it seems the reason they blocked me is because I made several money transfers from Dubai, where I used to live. I have provided full transparency surrounding those transfers which related to property I purchased in the UK, but they refuse to listen to reason. I have banked with NatWest since 1993 when I had a student account, and have never been overdrawn or owed money to them in over 25 years. They have not only cancelled my account, but actively stopped me moving to another bank – HSBC – using the switching service. I am totally baffled as to how they can get away with such behaviour. Please help.SR, by email You are right to say that you are not the first bank customer who had connections with the Middle East to find their account mysteriously shut down. It is because the banks are petrified of being accused of sanctions-busting in the US. We asked NatWest to take another look at the case, and while it will not reopen your account, it has now agreed to lift the block on using the switching service. You have now been able to switch over all your direct debits and so on. We hope that you don’t have any more payments coming in from that region as your new bank, HSBC, has also been closing accounts without warning. Frankly, it would probably have been better for you to have switched to Nationwide. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
