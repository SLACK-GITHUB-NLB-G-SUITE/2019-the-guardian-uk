While I am delighted that Gavin Williamson (May tells defence secretary: ‘You leaked, you are fired’, 2 May) has been removed from the government – remember he said that all British jihadists should be hunted down and killed in the Middle East rather than returned for trial here – I am sorry that as a result Rory Stewart no longer has responsibility for prisons. His is a deserved promotion, but as prisons minister he was the first member of the government to make any attempt to get to grips with the problems of our criminal justice system and offered to resign if things did not improve. How sad that there are not more of that ilk in public life these days.Maureen PantonMalvern, Worcestershire • Is the Gavin Williamson who has just been sacked as defence secretary for allegedly leaking plans discussed in the National Security Council to allow Huawei to be involved in building the UK’s 5G network the same Gavin Williamson who told us last year that it’s Jeremy Corbyn that “cannot be trusted”?Sasha SimicLondon • So Gavin Williamson was fired because it’s suspected that he was the source of the leak regarding Huawei. In his defence, it might be said that he put his country before his party, something that Theresa May would never do.Gareth HopcynStockport • The prime minister’s letter sacking her defence secretary could have been much shorter: “Go away and shut up.” Roshan PedderWest Molesey, Surrey • Could Gavin Williamson be Line of Duty’s “H”?
