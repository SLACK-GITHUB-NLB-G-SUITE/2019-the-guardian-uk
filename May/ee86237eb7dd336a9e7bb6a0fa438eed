David Pocock, the veteran Brumbies flanker, has called time on his domestic rugby union career after a persistent calf injury ruled him out for the remainder of the Super Rugby season. The 31-year-old has not played since sustaining the injury at a Wallabies training camp in January and on Tuesday announced he will not return to fields in Australia, bringing to an end a distinguished career that has seen him make 112 Super Rugby appearances. Pocock, who has represented his country 77 times, consulted with Brumbies and Wallabies medical staff before making the decision, with a view to regaining fitness in time to feature for the Wallabies at this year’s World Cup. “David’s injury is a rare calf strain that is unfortunately not progressing as hoped and needs further time to heal,” a Brumbies statement read. “No exact timeframe for a return to playing can be provided at this stage.” But the former Western Force player remains hopeful of making the World Cup, after which he will take up a contract with the Panasonic Wild Knights in Japan. He will likely retire from all forms of rugby once that deal expires. “The Brumbies have given me a home for the last seven years,” Pocock said. “They’ve supported me through injury and given me the opportunity to work on my game and my leadership as part of an incredible group of men.“After 13 years of professional rugby, I’m looking forward to the challenges the rest of this year holds and also thinking about what comes next.“The Brumbies and all supporters have been very good to me since my move to Canberra in 2013. I am grateful for their support.”
