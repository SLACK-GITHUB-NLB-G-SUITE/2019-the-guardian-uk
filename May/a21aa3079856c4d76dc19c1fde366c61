The chocolate cake of my dreams is a Swedish one called kladdkaka, which I ate in Stockholm, where I lived one spring. It was sticky, rich and barely able to contain itself: when cut, it oozed out on to the plate. I’d eat it with fruit, for balance (and decency) – the sharper the better. Although this cake isn’t quite that one, it is just as rich, a little fruity, and a sweet little throwback to that springtime in Stockholm. A dairy-free creme fraiche such as Oatly’s creamy oat fraiche is a good sidekick for this.

In a small saucepan over a low heat, warm the olive oil for a couple of minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the chocolate, leave to melt, stirring gently now and then, then set aside. Put the flour, sugar, cocoa and salt into a large bowl. Whisk with a fork until well combined, then stir in the chocolate mixture, vanilla extract, almond milk and passion fruit pulp. Use a large spoon to mix to a smooth batter, then scrape into the cake tin. Bake for 25 minutes, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin. Dust with more cocoa, if using, slice and serve.
