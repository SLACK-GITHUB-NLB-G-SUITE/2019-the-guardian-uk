Pep Guardiola is sure Liverpool will respond to defeat at Barcelona by beating Newcastle United and so maintain the pressure on Manchester City as the title race enters its last two games. City are a point ahead of Liverpool, who travel to Newcastle on Saturday evening, before Guardiola’s side host Leicester City on Monday. Liverpool were beaten 3-0 in Spain in Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg but Guardiola dismissed the prospect of them faltering on Tyneside after seeing their performance at the Camp Nou. “I don’t think so – the game was incredibly good, from both sides,” City’s manager said. “Liverpool were outstanding and it was a good performance from both. I enjoyed watching it. “I don’t think it will affect them. I think it will be not easy at Newcastle but they’ll be well prepared to win there.” He also believes Leicester will not subconsciously switch off. “That’s not going to happen,” Guardiola said. “The manager and the players want to do a good performance. The question makes no sense; forget about it. The Leicester players will not come here for their holiday. Maybe they have a chance to finish seventh and they will try to make a good game.” Kevin De Bruyne remains unavailable because of a hamstring injury, and Guardiola does not know whether Fernandinho’s knee problem will allow him to feature on Monday. “I didn’t speak with the doctors,” he said.
