A few days ago, I visited a friend’s office. She told me to help myself to a cup of tea, and being the polite, socially indoctrinated animal I am, I knew to ask which bottle of milk was hers. “All the milk is communal,” she said. “The company provides it.” I have heard of many workplace perks, but company milk is up there with the best: just think how many moments of conflict could be defused by this small investment! In my early 20s, milk issues plagued my life. At home my housemate would mark the milk levels on his bottle. I asked whether introducing such a weird energy into the house was worth it. “It’s the principle!” he said. “People should get their own.” And they did. “Great principles,” I’d think, trying to cram food into the limited fridge space remaining between those four identical milk bottles. And then there was work. My department chipped into a “milk kitty”, but we had to store it in the communal fridge. Theft inevitably occurred and despite several emails asking people either to stop, or join the kitty, it continued. People would openly bicker in the staff room about it. Tea time was fraught. Eventually, someone installed a mini fridge in our department. We’d offshored our milk assets; we’d created a semi-skimmed Switzerland. We also barely went into the staff room after that. It was lonely, but at least we had milk. Such incidents baffled me for years. Personally, I don’t care if people use my milk. If 20p’s worth of my 50p pint is lost to colleagues, so be it. That’s the cost of doing business, and the cost of living peacefully with others. But I now realise those conflicts weren’t about milk; they were about power, perceived slights, and a feeling of mutual respect. These days I take my coffee black.
