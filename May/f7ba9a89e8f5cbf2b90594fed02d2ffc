In Dylan Coburn Gray’s ambitious new “play for voices”, contemporary Dublin becomes the setting for the cycle of life, encompassing marriage, childbirth and old age: the epic and the ordinary, the present and the past. “The city is a record of all that has happened to us, is happening, or will.” With influences from Dylan Thomas to ancient epics, this award-winning script from the 25-year-old writer began as a commission for a spoken word festival. Linguistically playful and fresh, the play’s poetic origin gives it energy and rhythm, creating an impressionistic sweep rather than in-depth characterisations. Portraying three generations of an extended Dublin family over a single day, 60 characters are played by a versatile ensemble of six actors, pivoting between roles, genders and timeframes. The play offers a generous view of the city as one that absorbs newcomers with humorous tolerance. Could this be Dublin? A celebration rather than an excavation, Coburn Gray’s text showcases the characters’ gently poignant encounters. A solitary taxi driver, observing the night’s streets through his rear view mirror, weaves them together with occasionally portentous commentary. Mirrors recur as a motif: middle-aged characters catch glimpses of their parents’ reflections before realising they are seeing themselves. Directed by Caitríona McLaughlin, the staging encapsulates the text’s intricate mosaic structure, which is emphasised by Adrienne Quartly’s echoing soundscape. Set designer Sarah Bacon’s glass backdrop is an abstract map of Dublin and its coast, the lines suggesting a web of human connections. Changing from transparent glass into a reflective surface for Paul Keogan’s shimmering lighting, it reflects the play’s preoccupation with transient moments, intergenerational recognition and memory beautifully. At the Abbey theatre, Dublin, until 8 June. Then at Soho theatre, London, 12 June-6 July; and Galway international arts festival, 23-28 July.
