Every summer for the past five years, since the birth of his son, photographer Gerrard Gethings has had a bumble bee hive delivered to his home. In 2016, he decided to try to shoot them. He set up a backdrop next to the entrance to the hive, lit the scene, positioned the tripod and camera six inches away with a remote control – and waited. “I had to pull the trigger as soon as I saw the shadow of a bee emerging, as there was a tiny delay,” says Gethings. “It was a pleasurable way to spend the weekend.” Up close, you can see the bees’ extraordinary anatomy, their punky yellow buzz cuts. “They are so un-aerodynamic,” he says. “You can see how heavy their bodies are, how flimsy their wings. Theoretically, they shouldn’t be able to fly at all.” Ahead of World Bee Day on 20 May, photographs like this can remind us to appreciate these wonderful creatures afresh, and how important they are to the health of our planet.
