Despite the UK’s national love of tea, this wonderful ingredient goes under-used beyond the teapot. We use it in all our cocktails, to showcase just what it can do. We grow all our tea ourselves at our 100% organic garden in Tetulia, northern Bangladesh. Tea gives drinks a wonderful depth and complexity, and is an easy way to spruce up a classic, such as this old fashioned, which is on our new list and ideal for World Whisky Day. Serves 1 5ml oolong syrup (see method) 60ml bourbon – we use Maker’s Mark4 dashes Angostura bitters2 dashes orange bitters1 orange twist, to garnish First, make the syrup, which keeps for several weeks. Make a small pot of oolong tea, then add twice as much brown sugar as water, and stir to dissolve. Pour into a clean jar or bottle, seal, leave to cool, then refrigerate. For the drink, pour everything into a tumbler on the rocks, stir, and garnish with an orange twist. • Ahsan Akbar, Teatulia, London WC2
