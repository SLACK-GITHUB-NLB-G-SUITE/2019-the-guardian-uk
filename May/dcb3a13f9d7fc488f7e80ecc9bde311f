The England forward Nikita Parris has joined the European champions Lyon after leaving Manchester City. Parris, the all-time leading scorer in Women’s Super League, spent more than four years at City before confirming this month that she would leave at the end of her contract. “When Olympique Lyon come in for you, it’s not a team you turn down,” Parris told Sky Sports. “I knew if I was to turn it down it would be a massive regret. So I’m here, I’ve signed, I’m ready to compete and I know it’s going to be a great journey for me. I’m so excited. It’s the biggest club team in the world for women’s football.” The 25-year-old is a member of the England squad who will play at the World Cup in France next month. Lyon won a fourth consecutive Champions League title on Saturday, beating Barcelona 4-1 in the final, and their squad includes a second England player in Lucy Bronze. Parris was recently voted the Football Writers’ Association’s women’s player of the year.
