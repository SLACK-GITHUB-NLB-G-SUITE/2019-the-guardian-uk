At least three armed militants have stormed a luxury hotel in Pakistan and exchanged fire with government forces. Local media said the fighters stormed the Pearl Continental hotel in Gwadar just before 5pm local time on Saturday. Firing was still ongoing at 8pm, the assistant superintendent of police in the city told the Guardian. Security personnel cordoned off the area around the hotel. Gwadar, a small city in Balochistan province, is the site of a large port under construction by a Chinese company as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a centrepiece project of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure-building spree. Beijing has invested about $50bn in the port and in road links between Gwadar and China’s far-western Xinjiang province. The city of Gwadar, including its major hotels, is heavily guarded by the Pakistan army and paramilitary forces. Balochistan province is Pakistan’s poorest and most restive. Baloch separatists killed at least 11 members of the military in an attack in April. Militants attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi in November.
