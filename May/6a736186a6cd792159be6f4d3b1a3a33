For the first time in history, English clubs have a clean sweep in the European finals. Liverpool and Tottenham meet in the Champions league final on 1 June in Madrid. The two clubs have been allocated 16,613 tickets each, but return flights have rocketed to more than £1,300. Face-value tickets cost up to £410 for a restricted view and resale tickets are being sold on StubHub for up to €50,000. Arsenal and Chelsea fans face an even longer trip for the Europa league final. The London derby is being held in Baku, in Azerbaijan, and just 6,000 fans from each club will be allocated tickets.
