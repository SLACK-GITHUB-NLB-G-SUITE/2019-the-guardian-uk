It has been a wet and chilly week at Chester thus far, but the forecast is marginally better for the final day of the May meeting when the Chester Cup, one of the most popular and historic betting events of the entire Flat season, will take centre stage. Horses have been pounding several times around the Roodee in pursuit of this prize since 1824, when Doge Of Venice took the spoils less than 30 years after the last Doge relinquished his authority to Napoleon. Many great stayers have come home in front, including Brown Jack in 1931 and Sea Pigeon, one of nine dual winners, in 1977 and 1978, and this year’s race is very much up to standard with Austrian School, an impressive winner at Musselburgh last time, heading the market at 4-1. Mark Johnston’s four-year-old has a great deal in his favour. He was six lengths clear at the end of the Queen’s Cup last month yet races off just a 3lb higher mark, and he has also been fortunate in the draw with an ideal spot in stall five. That is certainly not the case for Low Sun, last year’s Cesarewitch winner, who has ended up in 17, and while Cleonte, another prominent name in the market, has drawn much better in one, it could be wasted on him as he tends to race from off the pace. Austrian School has an obvious chance and his backers seem sure to get a run for their money. At the prices, though, it is tempting to look for an alternative as 100-30 is pretty thin in such a competitive event. Who Dares Wins, who always goes well in this race, is one possibility but he is starting from stall 12 and Whiskey Sour (3.35) might be a better bet from stall seven at around 8-1. It could be argued that he does not have as many wins on his record as perhaps he should, but Willie Mullins’s gelding is impressively consistent, a former Grade One winner over hurdles and has been in fine form already this spring, finishing in the frame in the County Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham. Addeybb, last year’s Lincoln winner, returns to action in the Huxley Stakes but will need to be at the top of his game to cope with Forest Ranger (2.25), who took this race last year. Ptarmigan Ridge (1.50) and Epaulement (3.00) are two more with obvious claims on the Chester card, while Swindler (3.10) and Diamond Dougal (3.45) should both go well on a strong card at Ascot.
