Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb has hit a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids. They say the blast on Sunday wounded at least 16 people, including tourists. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media. Egypt has battled Islamist militants for years in the Sinai peninsula, and the insurgency has occasionally spilled over to the mainland, targeting minority Christians or tourists. The attack comes as Egyptâ€™s vital tourism industry is showing signs of recovery after the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled the former leader Hosni Mubarak. It is the second attack to target foreign tourists near the pyramids in less than six months.
