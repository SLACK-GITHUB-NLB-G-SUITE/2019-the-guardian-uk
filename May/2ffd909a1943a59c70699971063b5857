In 2017 you wrote about the seven-month delay in the completion of our new house by Harron Homes and intervened when they ignored snagging issues for a further seven months. Harron responded with a promise to get the work done but in the 18 months since, despite constant chasing, I’ve heard nothing. Now I’m told that the warranty has lapsed so Harron won’t be rectifying the problems, which include broken fencing and damaged piping, stone and brickwork. An illustration of the contempt with which it treats its customers is a sign outside the development that lists the “emergency contact” as “Mr Mute” with a smiley face wearing ear protectors.SB, Grassmoor, Chesterfield In the past two years 30 Harron Homes customers have contacted me to report delayed completion dates and unresolved problems. The company, which made a record turnover of nearly £150m last year, is rated one star on Trustpilot and has attracted frequent publicity for its poor customer service. Harron tells me that you bypassed its customer services to go to the media and that it is always more than happy to carry out any genuine issues during the warranty period that fall within the warranty providers’ guidelines. When I put to the firm that both statements were untrue in your case, it declined to comment. But a day later it got in touch and the work has been completed.
