It takes around 20 seconds for a horse to cover the last two furlongs in the Oaks, and for Maqsad (4.30), it could feel like the longest 20 seconds of her life. Stamina is the one significant doubt about William Haggas’s filly before Friday’s Classic at Epsom, but even after support from 7-1 to 11-2 since Thursday afternoon, that is factored into her price and she is well worth supporting to give her trainer a second Oaks winner. Despite having spent some time sifting through the stats for Siyouni’s offspring in search of positive evidence that she will get 12 furlongs, the news for Maqsad’s supporters is not good. He was, of course, a miler through-and-through, and very few of his sons and daughters ever race beyond 10. Those that do actually have a slightly higher strike-rate at 10 furlongs plus than is the case at shorter trips, but the data is limited to a tiny sample of runners. Many punters will also remember Laurens’s run in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks last summer, when last year’s French Oaks winner failed to last home. On the other hand, the handful of runners by Siyouni that do clearly stay further than 10 furlongs were bred along similar lines to Maqsad, with plenty of stamina on the dam’s side. The ground at Epsom is already officially good-to-firm in places and should be drying throughout the day, which will also give her every chance to get home. Stamina aside, Maqsad’s profile is entirely positive. She has several pounds in hand of the field on Timeform ratings thanks to an astonishingly easy success in the Pretty Polly Stakes last time out, when she stretched five lengths clear of the field in little more than a canter. Mehdaayih, for now at least the narrow favourite for this afternoon’s race, did something similar in the Cheshire Oaks but that was on soft ground, while Pink Dogwood’s half-length win in a Listed race at Navan last time gives her plenty to find to reach the normal standard for an Oaks winner and she would surely be at least a couple of points longer in the betting if she was trained by anyone but Aidan O’Brien. Just eight runners go to post for the Coronation Cup but it is even more open than the Oaks, with Kew Gardens, Old Persian and Lah Ti Dar all priced up at 7-2 or shorter. All three ran in last year’s St Leger and while Old Persian (3.10) finished fifth at Doncaster, behind his two market rivals, he beat Kew Gardens in the Great Voltigeur at York in August over today’s trip and registered an impressive time in the process. Elsewhere on the Epsom card, Firmament (2.35) is weighted to make an impact in the Investec Mile Handicap, while Misty Grey (2.00) put up a useful performance on the clock last time and could offer some value against Pinatubo in the opening Woodcote Stakes.
