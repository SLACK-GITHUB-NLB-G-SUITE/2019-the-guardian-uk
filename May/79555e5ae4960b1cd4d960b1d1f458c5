A Nepalese Sherpa has reached the summit of Mount Everest a record 24 times with his second ascent in a week, and he has set his sights on one more climb before he retires. Kami Rita Sherpa, 49, reached the 8,850-metre (29,035ft) summit by the traditional south-east ridge route, Mira Acharya, an official in the tourism department, said. The route was pioneered by the New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and remains the most popular snow trail leading to the highest point on Earth. Two other climbers, both Sherpas, have scaled Everest 21 times each. They have both retired from mountaineering. Kami, who goes by his first name, said he wanted to climb the mountain one more time. “I am still strong and want to climb Sagarmatha 25 times,” Kami told Reuters before leaving for his 23rd climb, referring to the Nepalese name for Everest.
