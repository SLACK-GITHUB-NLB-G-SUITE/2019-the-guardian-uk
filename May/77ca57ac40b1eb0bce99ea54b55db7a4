Emu Mini ebikePrice £999, emubikes.comMotor 250wRange 12-20 milesGears Shimano Nexus With its chunky 16in wheels and bouncy tyres, thick tubes and sturdy set-up, the Emu Mini is the Thelwell pony of folding ebikes. So many portable rides tend to be on the feeble and flimsy side. In order to be light enough to carry, manufacturers have to make concessions. So the pipework becomes thinner, handlebars and saddles are trimmed, accessories are cut back. If you are spending a lot of money, this is no problem as only the highest quality and most technical materials are used. But at the cheaper end you are left with a bike that feels at best skimpy and at worst dangerous. The Emu Mini, however, exudes a nuggety, indestructible, go-anywhere appeal. Sit on it and you feel safe and secure. It’s versatile and has a neat fold that makes it compact enough to carry and stow. It saves weight by having a relatively small battery. The whole thing tips the scales at 17kg. It only has a range of about 20 miles, but that’s plenty as the bike is intended to be a mixed-mode commuter – or a final-mile solution. It has a three-speed hub gear and disc brakes. Integrated lighting and full mudguards are included. Saddle up and the city is yours to explore. The Aeron is both antibacterial and wickable, but it’s the awesome pinkness that’ll make it a hit. dhb Aeron bike jersey £40, wiggle.co.uk Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
