Two men have been charged with rioting and petrol bomb offences as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was shot during disturbances in Northern Ireland last month. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said a 51-year-old man was also charged with arson of a hijacked vehicle and a 38-year-old with the arson and hijacking of a tipper truck. The two men were arrested in Derry on Thursday morning following searches at four homes. Two teenagers, aged 18 and 15, arrested in the raids have been released without charge. McKee, 29, was shot as she reported on unrest in the Creggan area of Derry while standing close to a police vehicle last month. The New IRA, a dissident republican group, admitted responsibility but the person who fired the shot and those who police say helped him have yet to be identified. PSNI have released CCTV of the person they believe fired the fatal shot but the footage does not show his face. There was shock at the killing of McKee on 18 April, and the New IRA claimed the gunfire was meant to be aimed at police. Police have praised residents in Creggan, a republican stronghold, for their level of cooperation. In a statement on Friday, PSNI said: “A 51 year-old man has been charged with riot, petrol bomb offences and arson of a hijacked vehicle. A 38-year-old man has been charged with riot, petrol bomb offences and the arson and hijacking of a tipper truck. “The charges relate to violent disorder in the Creggan area of Derry/Londonderry on Thursday 18 April as part of the investigation into the murder of Lyra McKee.” Both men are due to appear at Derry magistrates court on Saturday.
