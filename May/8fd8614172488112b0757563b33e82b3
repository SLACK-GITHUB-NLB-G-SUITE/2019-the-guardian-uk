Jan Vertonghen will not play for Tottenham at Bournemouth on Saturday as the club continue to monitor him in the wake of the head injury he suffered in Tuesday night’s Champions League defeat against Ajax. The centre-half will see a neurologist on Thursday and, having undergone a cerebral scan on Wednesday, he will have further tests in the coming days. It is unclear whether he will be available for Wednesday’s semi-final second leg in Amsterdam, when his team will attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit. The news from Spurs was that Vertonghen’s tests revealed nothing untoward while he reported no ill-effects from the shuddering aerial collision with his teammate Toby Alderweireld and the Ajax goalkeeper André Onana which left him bloodied and forced him out of the first leg in the 39th minute. Vertonghen had tried to continue after lengthy treatment only to feel unsteady on his legs and signal that he had to come off. In distressing scenes, he retched and half-collapsed before he was helped down the tunnel. Spurs say their doctors followed Football Association concussion guidelines and when they carried out the on-pitch assessment immediately after the incident, Vertonghen was lucid and, as such, fit to carry on. “All available video footage was relayed to our on-pitch medical team and they were able to confirm that he had suffered no loss of consciousness,” Spurs said in a statement on Wednesday evening. However, Vertonghen then “informed medical staff that symptoms were developing suddenly and that he no longer felt stable standing up”. Spurs added: “Tests today have been clear and testing will continue for the next few days.” Vertonghen posted on Instagram: “Not the way I wanted the game to go last night. Feeling OK today. Thanks to both sets of fans for the positive messages.”
