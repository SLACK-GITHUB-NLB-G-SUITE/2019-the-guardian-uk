Three City banks, a German software business and Facebook pay their staff the most in the UK, according to a new survey, while staff working at Domino’s Pizza and the shop chains Footasylum and Schuh receive the lowest rewards. The Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse and the German software firm Sap topped the list of the UK’s highest-paying companies compiled by the job search and recruiting website Glassdoor. Both companies pay employees a median total package of £90,000, including base salary, bonuses, tips, commission and other forms of compensation. Credit Suisse pays its staff a median annual salary of £82,000, while Sap pays £66,000. Deutsche Bank came third, with median total pay of £89,500 and a median salary of £80,000, while Facebook was in fourth place, with median pay of £89,000 and a median salary of £74,000. Standard Chartered rounded off the top five with median pay of £85,000 and a median salary of £76,000. Glassdoor’s Joe Wiggins said: “Technology and finance are dominating, which is not surprising. They are fighting over the same talent pool and battling it out for the really hard-to-hire roles such as software engineers and data scientists.” Salesforce, a Californian cloud-based software company, and other technology companies Dell, Oracle and Google made up the rest of the top 10, along with Swiss bank UBS. Google was in 10th place with median total pay of £78,000, ahead of Goldman Sachs at £74,000. Retailers Footasylum, Hollister, Schuh and CeX Webuy Entertainment, a video game store, along with Domino’s Pizza, were at the bottom of the survey. Staff working at these companies get paid £14,000 on average. According to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, median gross annual earnings in the UK were £24,006 in 2018, up 2.2% from £23,484 in 2017. Chief executives and senior officials were paid the most, at £97,083. The top tech positions open at technology companies, with the most vacancies, vary widely in salary, according to Glassdoor. Software engineers typically get paid a salary of £30,475; product managers are paid £50,000; software development engineers receive £47,037; solutions architects are on £66,553; and web developers get a salary of £32,030. But there are more non-tech roles than technology jobs available at technology companies, said Wiggins. They include sales account managers, operations managers, project managers, account executives and marketing managers. He said: “Tech firms need more people to sell and get the technology out to the market, rather than programmers who write code.”
