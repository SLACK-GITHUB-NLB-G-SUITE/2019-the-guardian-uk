Manchester airport has said its operations are “back to normal” after power issues led to the cancellation of almost 90 flights on Sunday. About 13,000 travellers were affected when a power problem disrupted the fuel supply at Britain’s third-busiest airport. The issue was resolved in the early hours of Monday, the airport said, but a small number of early flights were affected by delays and cancellations. Four Flybe flights were cancelled and several outbound flights delayed by about half an hour by 8am on Monday. The airport said some of these delays were due to fog rather than the power issues, and that flights were now “back to normal”. The travel chaos began at about 2pm on Sunday as passengers said they were grounded on flights at all three terminals of the airport. Flights to Tenerife, Belfast and Milan were among 87 cancelled, 43 of which were departures and 44 arrivals. Some said they waited for three hours on aeroplanes before being told their flights were cancelled. A number of passengers were put up in hotels overnight while some were ferried to Liverpool John Lennon airport 30 miles away. Graeme Forster, 37, from Queensferry in north Wales, and his wife waited on a stationary plane before being told their 3.45pm Jet2 flight to Lanzarote was cancelled. Forster told the BBC: “I am severely annoyed as Jet2 are not being helpful. They have also said compensation is not an option as it’s the airport’s fault not Jet2.” Ian Thornley, 29, had been booked on the 7.35pm Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to Manchester but was only told it was cancelled at 9.30pm. He said he then had to queue for an hour to arrange a flight for Monday afternoon. “We were at the gate for two hours and it came up as cancelled. We won’t be getting back to Manchester until Monday afternoon,” he added.
