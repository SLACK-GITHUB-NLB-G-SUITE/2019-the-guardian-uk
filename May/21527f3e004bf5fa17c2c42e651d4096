Hit sitcom Gavin and Stacey is coming back for a one-off special on Christmas day, after its creators James Corden and Ruth Jones have been secretly plotting its return for years. “Over the last 10 years we’ve talked a lot about Gavin and Stacey – where they might be today and what their lives might look like. So, in secret, we took the plunge and wrote this one-hour special,” they said. “We’ve loved revisiting Barry and Essex again, and bringing the characters back together has been a joy. We’re so excited.” Corden and Jones will return to their roles as Smithy and Nessa, as will Mathew Horne, Joanna Page, Rob Brydon, Larry Lamb, Melanie Walters and Alison Steadman. Ruth Jones and I have been keeping this secret for a while... We’re excited to share it with you. See you on Christmas Day ⁦@BBCOne⁩ #GavinandStacey pic.twitter.com/gTRa3cp90t Gavin and Stacey aired over three series, plus a Christmas special, from 2007 to 2010 on the BBC. It told the story of Gavin (Horne), from Essex, and Stacey (Page), from Barry in Wales, who fell in love and married after speaking on the phone to each other every day at work. The 2010 New Year’s day finale was watched by more than 10.2 million viewers. Charlotte Moore, director of BBC content, said: “Everyone at the BBC is hugely excited to be welcoming back Gavin and Stacey to BBC One this Christmas. “We can’t wait to see what’s happened to everyone over the last nine years and what’s next for one of the nation’s favourite comedy families.” The sitcom was a breakthrough hit for BBC Three and eventually moved to BBC One. Corden went on to find fame in the US as host of The Late Late Show, best known for its segment Carpool Karaoke, which has seen Corden sing with everyone from Adele to Michelle Obama.
