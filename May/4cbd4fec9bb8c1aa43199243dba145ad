A relative of Tyrann ‘Honey Badger’ Mathieu has been accused of trying to extort $5m from the Kansas City Chiefs safety. ESPN reported that Geourvon Keinell Sears, 21, allegedly threatened to reveal personal information to TMZ if he didn’t receive the money. Documents filed in the US district court for the Eastern district of Louisiana contend Sears demanded $1.5m from Mathieu in April, then raised the price to $5m. While the alleged victim of the extortion plot is identified only by initials in court documents, Mathieu’s lawyer, Denise White, confirmed to KMBC 9 in Kansas City that Mathieu was the target. White said Mathieu is working through a “private and personal family issue”. Sears is alleged to have told Mathieu’s friends that if the money was not paid, he would “kill you all”. Sears is set to appear in court on 21 June. He is free on $25,000 bond. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Mathieu, 27, is entering his seventh NFL season but his first with the Chiefs after signing a three-year contract in March. He spent the first five seasons of his career with the Arizona Cardinals, then played the 2018 season with the Houston Texans. A first-team All-Pro in 2015, Mathieu has played in 82 games (73 starts) in his career and has 394 tackles, 13 interceptions and 19 quarterback hits on his record.
