Dean Ryan has been appointed director of rugby for the Dragons in a move that will see him leave his role as the Rugby Football Union’s head of international player development. Ryan, whose club coaching career includes spells at Worcester and Gloucester, will depart the post he has held at Twickenham since 2016 during the summer. “It was always going to take a unique challenge to bring me back into the club environment and following my discussions with (Dragons chairman) David Buttress and the WRU, I’m hugely excited about what lies ahead,” Ryan said. As part of the job, Ryan will take up a seat on the Dragons’ board and is responsible for all rugby matters on and off the pitch. “I will take a hands-on role with the playing department and use my influence as a board member to address various issues so that the Dragons are set up from top to bottom to ensure everything is geared around the on-field and off-field success of the region,” Ryan said. The 52-year-old filled the role of rugby consultant for the Dragons during the 2012/13 season. “I’d like to thank Dean for his commitment to developing the next generation of players and coaches during his time at the RFU,” RFU director of professional rugby Nigel Melville said.“Dean’s innovative approach to coach development has enabled a number of young Premiership coaches to coach at international level and for some of our younger players to experience unique leadership challenges that will benefit them in the future. We wish Dean every success in his new role at Dragons.”
