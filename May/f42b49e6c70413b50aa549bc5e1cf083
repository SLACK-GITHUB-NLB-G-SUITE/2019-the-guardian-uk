Stock markets around the world are sending a message to Donald Trump: end your trade war with China or face the nightmare scenario of running for a second term in the White House with the economy in serious trouble. The big falls seen on the world’s major bourses this week are the result of one thing: the growing fear that the impact of the standoff between Washington and Beijing on trade, industrial production and business confidence. Trump seriously miscalculated if he thought Xi Jinping would quickly cave in to US pressure. On the contrary, Beijing’s hint that it will restrict exports of the rare-earth metals used in advanced electronics suggests it is digging in for a long battle. The trigger point for the current stock market jitters has been the inversion of the yield curve. Normally, the yield or interest rate on a bond that matures in a few months is lower than that on one that matures in 10 years because the longer the investment the greater the risk of rising inflation. When the curve is inverted, yields on shorter-dated bonds are higher than those on longer-dated bonds. This is a pretty rare occurrence and only tends to happen when a recession is looming. It has not been lost on investors that an inverted yield curve provided a warning when things were about to go pear-shaped in 2007. Trump is in a bit of a spot. The boost from last year’s tax cuts is starting to fade at a time when the lagged effects of last year’s increases in interest rates are beginning to be felt. Add to that a protracted trade war and it is easy to envisage a scenario in which the US economy slows fast. To head off the prospect of fighting for re-election during a recession, Trump needs the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and he needs to make his peace with China – both sharpish. For the past few months the target for the president’s tweets has tended to be China rather than the Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell. Expect that pattern to soon be reversed.
