Nick Kyrgios has been defaulted from the Italian Open. The volatile Australian was playing his second-round match against Norway’s Casper Ruud at the Foro Italico and had levelled the match at one set all after losing the opener. After Ruud broke back to make it 1-1 in the deciding set, Kyrgios was given a game penalty, apparently for swearing at a line judge, and promptly erupted. He slammed down his racket, kicked a water bottle and hurled a chair on to the court. The umpire called the referee to court but, before he could be officially defaulted, Kyrgios told the crowd, “I’m done”, packed up his bag and walked off, to loud whistles and jeers. Ruud was leading 6-3, 6-7,(5), 2-1 and will face Juan Martín del Potro in the third round. 😱(🎥@TennisTV ) #ibi19 pic.twitter.com/ku2wRVc7Lq Well...Kyrgios gets a game penalty and then walks off court, handing Casper Ruud a place in the last 16#ibi19 pic.twitter.com/T4jhvbV1RN It is far from the first controversy Kyrgios has been involved in and the Australian, who will automatically forfeit his prize money, is sure to face a heavy fine at the very least. The 24-year-old was given a ban by the ATP in 2016 after walking off court midway through a match against Mischa Zverev at the Shanghai Masters and may well find himself suspended again. Kyrgios’s antics came only 24 hours after he laid into the sport’s biggest stars in an interview on the No Challenges Remaining podcast, saying he “could not stand” Novak Djokovic and calling Rafael Nadal “super salty”. After Wednesday’s washout it was a packed schedule in Rome, with Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer all due to play again on Thursday after winning their second-round matches. It all meant the title contenders had to try to win their double-headers as efficiently as possible to save energy. Federer saved all seven break points he faced to beat João Sousa 6-4, 6-3 and is due to play Borna Coric for a spot in the quarter-finals. “Good thing was this one was not that physical,” Federer said. “Borna is tough. I lost to him a couple of times last year.” Compared to his attacking display in Madrid last week, Federer’s defensive game was particularly sharp. En route to breaking Sousa midway through the first set, Federer ran down a drop shot with a perfectly timed slide and replied with a delicate, angled put away. Federer fell behind 0-40 in the next game but then won five straight points to secure a 5-3 lead, closing out the service game with a stretched forehand cross-court passing shot on the full run from the corner, which drew a loud roar from the Foro Italico crowd. Federer hit 25 winners to Sousa’s eight. The eight-time Rome champion Nadal cruised past Jérémy Chardy 6-0, 6-1 and will meet Nikoloz Basilashvili. The Spanish veteran Fernando Verdasco rallied past the fifth-seeded Dominic Thiem 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Others advancing included Kei Nishikori, Diego Schwartzman, and Jan-Lennard Struff.
