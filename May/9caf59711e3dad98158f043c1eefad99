Vincent Kompany wants to know how frequently he can expect to play for Manchester City next season before deciding whether to sign a one-year contract. It is understood the club are willing to offer fresh terms to the 33-year-old but he wants as much game time as possible as he approaches the end of his career. Kompany scored a memorable winner against Leicester on Monday that means City will be champions if they win at Brighton on the last day of the season on Sunday or at least match Liverpool’s result at home to Wolves. Kompany and Guardiola are expected to discuss the defender’s future soon and Bernardo Silva hopes the captain will continue at City, his club since 2008. “What a player, what a captain and hopefully he can stay with us for a few more years,” Silva said. “He is one of the biggest players this club has ever seen and I hope he can stay. “He’s a man for the big games. Whenever you need him, he’s always there. He doesn’t feel the pressure. It doesn’t matter to him – he likes the pressure, embraces it and he gets even better for that.

I don’t know what happened in his mind but the way he shot was unbelievable.” After the trip to Brighton, City have the FA Cup final against Watford at Wembley the following Saturday. “The pressure is high,” Silva said. “There is one game and then the FA Cup final; we want to win both titles. We play against Brighton and it won’t be easy – we faced them in the FA [Cup] semi-finals and they are very physical.”
