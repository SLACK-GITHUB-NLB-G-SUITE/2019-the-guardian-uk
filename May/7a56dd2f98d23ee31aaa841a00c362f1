Steve Clarke has been appointed as the new Scotland head coach on a three-year deal, the Scottish Football Association has announced. The 55-year-old, who guided Kilmarnock to a third-placed finish in the Ladbrokes Premiership this season, replaces Alex McLeish, who stepped down from the role in April after 18 months at the helm. “It is an honour to be appointed Scotland national team head coach and I will undertake those responsibilities with pride and commitment,” said Clarke. “I firmly believe we have a talented group of players who can achieve success on the international stage. I look forward to working with them and helping them to fulfil those ambitions. “I appreciate the Scotland supporters have waited a long time for the national team to qualify for a major tournament. Now we have a Women’s World Cup to look forward to in France this summer and it’s my motivation to emulate the success of Shelley Kerr and her squad by leading us to Euro 2020. “I believe we can qualify and look forward to that journey with the players and the fans, starting against Cyprus and Belgium next month.” Ian Maxwell, Scottish FA chief executive, said: “Steve’s pedigree as a coach and manager of the highest regard set him apart in a high-calibre group of candidates. This season’s achievements simply reaffirm the credentials we believe will be of huge benefit to the Scotland national team. “I am delighted that we now have the country’s deserved Manager of the Year to lead the team and his experience over the past two decades will be integral to rejuvenating our Uefa Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, which resumes next month. “It was important that we undertook the recruitment process diligently and respectfully, especially given the importance of the final games of the domestic season for Kilmarnock, Steve and his players. “I would like to thank the Kilmarnock owner, Billy Bowie, and the club in general for their professionalism throughout the recruitment process.”
