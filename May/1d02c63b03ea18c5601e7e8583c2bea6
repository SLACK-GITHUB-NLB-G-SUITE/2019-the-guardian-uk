Serena Guthrie will lead England’s Roses in the upcoming Netball World Cup in Liverpool in July. Guthrie, who has 90 caps since her debut in 2008, will captain a 12-strong squad named on Thursday by the head coach, Tracey Neville. The centre is one of eight players selected who were also part of England’s gold medal-winning squad in the Commonwealth Games last year, alongside Jade Clarke, Eboni Usoro-Brown, Joanne Harten, Helen Housby, Geva Mentor, Natalie Haythornthwaite and Chelsea Pitman. There is no place for the former Roses captain Ama Agbeze, who spoke this week of her disappointment at missing out on the final 12. Guthrie said: “Being selected and asked to be captain is a proud moment for me. It’s going to be a real honour for us all to step out in front of the nation. After our triumph at the Commonwealth Games last year the pressure is on to try and secure gold on a global stage again. The competition is tighter than ever but it is a huge comfort to be playing on home soil and to have the nation behind us. I can’t wait.” Francesca Williams and Natalie Panagarry will make their World Cup debuts at the tournament which begins on 12 July. Neville, who has led England to No 2 in the world rankings, said: “There were some really tough decisions to make in selection. It is fantastic to see the versatility we have amongst the final 12, plus the emergence of two outstanding leaders in Serena Guthrie as captain and Jade Clarke as vice-captain. Not only are they world-class players but together they have set the standard within our Roses programme both on and off the court.” Helen Housby (NSW Swifts)Joanne Harten (Giants Netball)Natalie Haythornthwaite (NSW Swifts)Rachel Dunn (Wasps Netball)Serena Guthrie (capt, Team Bath)Jade Clarke (Wasps Netball)Chelsea Pitman (Adelaide Thunderbirds)Natalie Panagarry (Loughborough Lightning)Layla Guscoth (Adelaide Thunderbirds)Eboni Usoro-Brown (Team Bath)Geva Mentor (Collingwood Magpies)Francesca Williams (Wasps Netball)
