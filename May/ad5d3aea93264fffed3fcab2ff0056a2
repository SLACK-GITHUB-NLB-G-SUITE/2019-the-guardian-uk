You can also go online to the National Numeracy Challenge, a free online learning tool designed to help you improve your everyday maths skills. It will give you a breakdown of your capability in five areas of numeracy, and tips on how to get better. Here’s its advice on coping with everyday challenges if maths is not your strongest trait. • Keep control, even if you delegate. If someone else handles your finances, make sure you are closely involved in the process. Always examine the figures before making any decisions, so that you are in command of your financial situation both now and later down the line. • Check your understanding of percentages. This is an area where many people struggle, and it features in nearly all of the financial decisions you will make in life. Do you use the percentage button on your calculator? The difference between 0.2% and 1% may not seem much, but on a sizeable loan or investment this can make a huge difference both now and how it plays out over time. • Know when to use savings v credit. Understanding the basics about interest (especially compound interest) will help you to be better with money. Some people like to keep cash on hand for “emergencies” rather than paying off debts. This is generally a bad idea – borrowing costs more than the interest you will earn on savings, so paying off debts will cost you less. • Know when to pay more. When discussing a remortgage or investment, prepare by doing calculations in advance. In the case of a mortgage, understand how repayments would be affected by an increase in interest of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and so on, and how reducing the term could reduce how much you pay in total. • Audit your numeracy skills. Our ability with numbers can fluctuate throughout life. If you suspect you may be out of practice and could benefit from taking steps to improve, then the National Numeracy Challenge website can help.
