Once the children are in bed, there’s nothing like a proper cocktail to draw a line under the strains of the day and say hello to the grownups’ time ahead. Serves 1 35ml good-quality vodka – we use Ketel One20ml sake20ml lemon juice10ml gomme syrup1 egg white3 raspberries1 raspberry, fresh or dried, to garnish Put all the liquids in a shaker, and dry-shake so the egg white emulsifies. Add a big handful of ice and the raspberries, muddle the fruit, then shake again and double-strain into a coupette. Garnish with a fresh or dried raspberry, and serve. • Abdul Hannan Mohamed, bar supervisor, Bombay Bustle, London W1
