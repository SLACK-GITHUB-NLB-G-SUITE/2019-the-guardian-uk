My fiance is an alcoholic and, although he has admitted it, we go round in circles when he returns to hiding cider in his bag. He blames his drinking on work stress (he is a chef) and he was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago. Medication helped, but as soon as he feels better he stops taking it and goes back to drinking, even at work. The last time he had a panic attack it was so serious I had to call an ambulance. We have two small children and I can’t cope. What do I do? How do I protect my family?
