British Airways closed my Executive Club membership and has given my Avios reward points to someone with a different name. This was done without consultation. I had about 11,550 points, and a flight scheduled in July, which would earn more. I received an email in March telling me that 5,776 points had been transferred into my Executive Club account. But the other 5,776 appear to have been put into a different name, a combination of my Christian name and my wife’s maiden name – which, following our marriage, she changed to my surname. I’ve phoned and emailed. I’ve emailed BA’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, four times. Each time, customer relations staff promise to sort the problem, but nothing happens. I have considered taking out a small claims case or trying legal proceedings for theft. DC, Hereford BA says this was an administrative error linked to – as you suspected – when the account was set up many years ago. It has apologised and resolved this issue. The points have been transferred correctly to your account and it has given you an extra 20,000 as a goodwill gesture. On BA’s economy flights to Rome they could typically be worth between £750 and £1,000. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
