Six winners since Saturday morning have pushed Oisin Murphy into an early lead in the race for the Flat jockeys’ championship, six clear of Silvestre de Sousa, the champion in three of the past four seasons, and the 23-year-old is now the narrow favourite to claim the title for the first time. His confidence levels should therefore be sky-high when he weighs out to ride Telecaster, the Dante Stakes winner, in Saturday’s Derby, and with only three points separating the top four in the Classic betting, there is a fair chance that Murphy will head the market at Epsom as well. But even a Derby winner only counts for one in the title race, which is currently shaping up to be a three-runner race between Murphy, De Sousa and last season’s leading rider in the north, Danny Tudhope. Murphy currently has 22 winners from 112 rides, a strike-rate of 20%, while the equivalent figures for Tudhope and De Sousa, respectively, are 21 from 92 (23%) and 16 from 81 (20%), and even at this early stage of proceedings, it could be significant that De Sousa’s total number of rides is well behind Murphy’s. It is four years since the rules for the jockeys’ championship were – somewhat controversially – changed to start the official campaign on Guineas weekend in early May and end on Champions Day in mid-October. In theory the intention was to emphasise quality over quantity and also mean that the title race did not come down to races in late October and early November when the elite riders are often riding abroad. In practice, the busiest jockey has still finished at the top of the pile every time, with De Sousa taking at least 730 rides in all three of his championship seasons, and tying with Jim Crowley on 759 in 2016, when Crowley finished top with 148 winners to De Sousa’s 132. If he keeps taking rides at his current rate, De Sousa will struggle to reach 650, never mind 700 or more, by mid-October and it seems at least possible that his commitment to ride for King Power Racing this season is boosting the quality of his mounts, including Bangkok, a leading Derby candidate, but cutting down on the quantity. Murphy, on the other hand, is on course for nearly 900 rides by mid-October and is clearly putting everything into his attempt to win a first title. Suspensions and injuries are an ever-present danger, however, and at the prices on offer on Tuesday morning, it seems baffling that Tudhope is still available at 25-1 with SkyBet. Paul Hanagan showed in 2010 and 2011 that it is possible to win the title riding mainly in the north, and Tudhope also has links with some leading southern trainers, including William Haggas, Archie Watson and Michael Bell. He is on course to ride more than 700 rides and should surely be a lot shorter than 25-1, or for that matter the 16-1 on offer with Bet365. The businessman-turned trainer Roger Fell has made a fantastic start to his time as a trainer, notching 56 winners in only his third season as a license holder. With 18 on the board already this season, four of them last week, his team are nicely positioned for another impressive campaign. The Nawton-based handler has runners at three different meetings on Tuesday, one of which is my nap. Zodiakos (3.50) has been a model of consistency this spring and the handicapper has not been harsh with him for his win at Wetherby three weeks ago, putting him up only three pounds. He was narrowly beaten in his only subsequent run at Chelmsford on the all-weather, but returning to the turf at Redcar he can get back in to the winners’ enclosure. John Gosden had a less than memorable weekend by his remarkable standards, but mostly his string are in great form and the Newmarket trainer can add to his current tally of 56 winners for the season with Franz Kafka (3.00). Unusually for a Gosden-trained horse, the selection has had five runs without a win, but he has been coming up against well-above-average horses. First time out this year the subsequent German 2,000 Guineas winner Fox Champion beat him by a half-length and his two subsequent efforts were close up behind smart opposition. This Brighton contest has five runners but the only possible opponent on form, Current Option, has yet to match the form of the selection. Beverley’s uphill finish proved just too much for Fantastic Ms Fox (2.50) last time out, but Redcar is nowhere near as tough at the finish and will be more to her liking. Richard Fahey’s charge is only rated two pounds higher than last time and is clearly still improving.
