Jon Dunn saw his first orchid as a boy on a Somerset hillside. Its intense colour, “a rich, royal purple”, was unlike any flower he’d ever seen. The impact was visceral – “I felt breathless” – and it was the beginning of “a lifelong affair”. Now living in a Shetland crofthouse, Dunn sets out on an ambitious quest to see every one of the 52 orchid species in the British Isles “in the course of one frantic, glorious, kaleidoscopic flowering season”. Starting in Somerset in March with the purple flower that first infected him with orchid fever, he sees a lurid pink and yellow sawfly orchid blooming in Dorset (far from its native southern Europe), dense-flowered orchids in the Burren, County Clare, and the holy helleborine (“uninspiring”) on Lindisfarne. By autumn he has seen 51 of the species. Just the appropriately named ghost orchid remains elusive, a “slippery phantom” only to be glimpsed as a dried specimen in a herbarium, “the ghost of a ghost orchid”. Dunn’s descriptions of his “orchidaceous treasures” are wonderfully vivid and his account of his travels is full of amusing anecdotes of fellow obsessives, such as Derek Jarman and John Fowles, who admitted that woodcock orchids “would make me cry, if I were the crying kind”. Dunn finds an early spider orchid blooming by Jarman’s Prospect Cottage in Dungeness. This is a beautifully written celebration of these mysterious and endangered plants that will delight orchidophiles and nature lovers alike. • Orchid Summer is published by Bloomsbury (£9.99).
