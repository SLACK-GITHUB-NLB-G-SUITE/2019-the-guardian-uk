When Dorothy takes her journey along the Yellow Brick Road in The Wizard of Oz, the adults in her life reappear as fantasy equivalents. Something similar happens in this feisty play by Jack Nurse and Robbie Gordon. Here, the drinkers in an East Lothian pub, readying themselves for Theresa May’s “strong and stable” government, become reborn as four real-life volunteers from Prestonpans who joined Scotland’s 549-strong contingent to fight against Franco’s fascist forces in 1936. George Watters (played by Gordon) is a political agitator, railing against austerity in the modern-day scenes just like his doppelganger complains about working conditions in the 1930s. It is Watters who galvanises his friends, the quick-tempered Jock Gilmour, the fickle young Bill Dickson and the self-serving Jimmy Kempton, into action. They have no more interest in the people of Spain than your average group of small-town drinkers, but they’re up for an adventure. The Spanish civil war was fought, the play suggests, not only by political idealists but also by the opportunistic, the unhinged and the economically deprived. That gives Nurse’s production for Wonder Fools a more complex tone than its agitprop form suggests. Yes, it makes us question our own willingness to make political sacrifices, but it also shows how young men go to war – even a just war – for imperfect reasons. Their staying power on the battlefield can be fatally affected by their motivation for being there. Launching a UK tour in the town the men came from, 549 is given a raw and stripped-back staging that could seem unsophisticated were it not for the drive of the young performers, the polish of the choreographed battle scenes and the gutsiness of the singing. At Prestonpans Town Hall until 25 May. Then touring.
