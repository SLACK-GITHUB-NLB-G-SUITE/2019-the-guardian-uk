As the UN, Nasa, Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and Extinction Rebellion have so clearly articulated in recent months, the jig is up: if we don’t change our behaviour we can’t survive. Can art can play a part in bringing about such a shift? Serpentine Gallery’s Hans Ulrich Obrist co-curated 2014’s Extinction Marathon, a starry 24-hour exploration of impending global wipeout; this new arts and discussion event is part of the Serpentine’s General Ecology project, which considers our relationship with the natural world. The focus here is on plant sentience and intelligence, and the unwieldy title sets the tone perfectly – TED-style soundbites are ditched in favour of knotty conversations. Indeed, you’d be hard-pressed to hashtag most of its labyrinthine discussions. Charismatic Kew Gardens horticulturalist Carlos Magdalena, AKA the Plant Messiah, takes us on a tour of the world’s most imperilled plants, while artist-healer Tabita Rezaire explores “plant cosmology” and composer Antoine Bertin performs from his radio series of arboreal field recordings, The Edge of the Forest. At its heart is the world premiere of a composition by Chris Watson, a founder member of the 1970s industrial band Cabaret Voltaire, who became a wildlife sound recordist, collaborating with Attenborough on his Life series. The venue is the only one in Europe to be equipped with immersive L-ISA surround sound, and it turns Salmo Salar – The Three Realms, which follows the journey of migrating salmon, into a glorious, sensual rush. This is sound as sculpture: in the dark, surrounded by an audience of 500, you don’t just hear the sound of bearded seals singing and orca whales moving through forests of kelp – you experience it physically.
