Michael Wolff, whose book Fire and Fury lifted the lid on the Trump administration last year, is releasing a sequel in three weeks’ time. Siege: Trump under Fire will be released on 4 June, publishers Henry Holt and Company announced on Wednesday. Like its million-selling predecessor, Siege promises a juicy, behind-the-scenes look at the current White House and a president who is “volatile, erratic, and exposed”. The book will focus on tensions amid the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged ties between Russian officials and the Trump presidential campaign. According to Holt, Wolff spoke to more than 150 sources, although the publisher declined to say whether any are currently in the administration. Fire and Fury was among the first books to extensively document the continuing conflicts in the Trump White House.
