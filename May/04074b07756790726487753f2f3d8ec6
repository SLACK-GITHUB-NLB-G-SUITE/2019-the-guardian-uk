Having coughed up £85,000 for a place in the Derby, connections of Telecaster (4.30) were surely hoping for better accommodation than stall two, from which no Derby winner has emerged since starting stalls were introduced half a century ago. But that may prove only an inconvenience on his way to proving himself the best of these colts. While his background is not that of a conventional Derby winner, from a stable that rarely competes at the highest level and unraced until March, his performance in winning the Dante was thoroughly convincing. He broke alertly, ran fast enough to secure a handy position and then settled before finishing more strongly than a classy rival in Too Darn Hot. He will have to follow a very similar pattern and his draw is no help but at least the likely pace-setter, Sovereign, is only two stalls away in four. If Telecaster can latch on to his tail for the first furlong, the early part of the race may work out quite well for him. Telecaster’s sire is New Approach, another free-going sort who nonetheless had the stamina to win a Derby, and his dam was also comfortable at this distance. While he has had plenty of racing in a short time, the signs show he is thriving on it and he is surprisingly backable at 5-1. Sir Dragonet has a better draw but has been a slow starter so far and may not make best use of it. This fast ground is a question mark for him. From the same stable, Anthony Van Dyck is more of a worry, as an experienced colt who impressed at Lingfield. Circus Maximus is also going the right way and Frankie Dettori could help him hit the frame. Broome and Bangkok are both professional types and unbeaten this year but they have not yet shown the necessary quality. Japan and Line Of Duty were well beaten in the Dante and may struggle to turn that form around just a fortnight later. 2.00 Epsom A quality juvenile last year, Victory Command was repeatedly disappointing this season until his staying-on third place in the Silver Bowl last weekend. Mark Johnston’s colt looks ready for this step up in distance and is now quite attractively weighted, down 10lb from his peak rating. 2.35 Epsom The key bit of form here looks like being a Listed contest at Goodwood four weeks ago, in which Awesometank held on by a head from the strong-finishing Anna Nerium. It’s tempting to give the runner-up a chance to turn that around over this slightly longer trip but Awesometank is a very likeable filly with a high strike-rate who may be sharper again for that seasonal reappearance. The fitting of cheekpieces will not hurt and nor will James Doyle’s presence in the saddle. Veracious beat the selection last year but disappointed last month and the fitting of a tongue tie is disconcerting. 3.10 Epsom This Diomed Stakes could provide an early thrill for the King Power connections, to be represented by Bangkok in the big race. They have the improving Bye Bye Hong Kong in this with an obvious chance, getting the weight-for-age allowance from all his rivals. He was convincing against Oh This Is Us at Windsor last time and his front-running style may play better here than Zaaki’s strong finishing. 3.45 Epsom Caspian Prince is trying to win the Dash for the fourth time and for a fourth different trainer, though it could be that his draw in stall 10 is no help, as it has seemed preferable to be drawn to one side or the other. Duke Of Firenze, another 10-year-old, comes here in fine form and has an excellent draw in 19. But it will be hard for them all to hold off Hathiq, who carries just a 4lb penalty for his Curragh success on Sunday. Very lightly raced until this year, this half-brother to a Guineas runner-up is now making hay from his low rating.
