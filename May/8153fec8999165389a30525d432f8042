James Harden scored 38 points and the Houston Rockets held on for a 112-108 win over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night to even their Western Conference semi-final series at 2-2. The Rockets were up by nine before the Golden State scored the next seven points, capped by a three from Stephen Curry, to get within 110-108 with 19 seconds left. Harden made one of two free throws with 11.5 seconds left. Kevin Durant missed a three after that. But the Warriors got the rebound and Curry also missed a three-point attempt before Golden State were forced to foul Chris Paul. He made one of two free throws to secure the victory. After losing the first two games of the series on the road, the Rockets head back to Golden State for Game 5 on Wednesday night with momentum on their side after their overtime win in Game 3 before Monday night’s victory. The Warriors got 34 points from Kevin Durant, who had 46 in the Game 3 loss. Curry, who was criticized after shooting seven for 23 in Game 3, got off to a good start, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. He cooled off after that, but finished with 30 points on 12 of 25 shooting. The the night’s other game, Giannis Antetokounmpo watched the Bucks bench open a double-digit lead, then returned with a dominating fourth quarter to finish with 39 points and 16 rebounds as Milwaukee beat Boston 113-101 on Monday night to move one win from its first trip to the Eastern Conference finals since 2001. “If we’re honest with you, when Giannis and Khris [Middleton] go to the bench, you’re concerned,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said after his reserves outscored Boston’s 32-7 in the game and turned a 59-all tie into a 78-68 lead. “But you have confidence that that group can play.” In what might be his last home game for the Celtics, Kyrie Irving scored 23 points with 10 assists. But he was seven for 22 from the floor, including one for seven from three-point range. “Who cares? I’m a basketball player,” said the six-time All-Star, who can become a free agent this summer. “I’m trying to do it all. For me, the 22 shots – I should have shot 30.”
