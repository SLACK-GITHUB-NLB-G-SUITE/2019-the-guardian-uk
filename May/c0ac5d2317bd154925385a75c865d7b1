Yes, John Crace (Digested week, 25 May) it was lovely to see Prince William’s three young children enjoying Kate’s Chelsea flower show garden with their parents. A pity, though, that, according to Chelsea’s own rules, no other children under five would be allowed in to enjoy the gardens in the same way.Denise MurphyWhitby, North Yorkshire • Another hidden treasure of Mulhouse (Letters, 25 May) is the Musée de l’Impression sur Étoffes (Museum of Printed Textiles) which has a superb collection of textiles, sample books (6 million textile samples!) and old printing machinery. It also puts on excellent exhibitions.Rosemary CrillLondon • At line 625 of Antigone the Theban chorus declare that man acts for the shortest (oligoston) time outside ruin (Letters, 22 and 24 May). It’s man’s time disaster-free that’s small, not man. However, some separate “oligos” and “ton” so that it does indeed read “the small man lives outside disaster”.Peter McKenna Liverpool • The 11th thing we have learned (Ten things we learned at this year’s Cannes film festival, 25 May) is that older male film directors still think it’s a good look to grip their much younger female stars’ waists. Creepy.Ruth EversleyPaulton, Somerset • My wife is right. I am a child. This was confirmed by this week’s Feast – “Cooking with kids”. So many wonderful recipes for me to try. Please do another children’s version soon.Philip KendallBishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
