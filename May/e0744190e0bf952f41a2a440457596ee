Odell Beckham Jr, a player known for his confidence in his abilities, aims to turn the Cleveland Browns into a team to rival the all-conquering New England Patriots. After years in a long-term slump, the Browns are seen as a team with a bright future after drafting talented players such as quarterback Baker Mayfield and defensive end Myles Garrett, as well as trading for Beckham, one of the best wide receivers of his generation. “I plan on being [in Cleveland] for the next five years and trying to bring as many championships there as possible, turning [the Browns] into the new Patriots,” Beckham told GQ in an interview published on Tuesday. He is also confident that Mayfield, who put in a confident rookie campaign in 2018, will be a force in the NFL for years to come. “I would say he’s next, but I feel like he’s now,” Beckham said. “He’s Brett Favre. He’s going to be a Hall of Famer.” Mayfield is only 24, while Beckham is entering his prime at 26, the same age as his fellow Pro Bowl receiver Jarvis Landry. Beckham and Landry were college teammates at LSU before reuniting in Cleveland. “I would take a bullet for him,” Beckham said. “I hope it’d hit me in the arm, but I’d take a bullet for him.” The Browns have not made the playoffs since 2002, and have not had a winning season since 2007. They lost 31 of the 32 games they played in the 2016 and 2017 seasons, but put up a respectable 7-8-1 season in 2018. Most bookies have them at 14-1 to win the upcoming season’s Super Bowl. The favourites, naturally, are the Patriots.
