The season finale opens with a message from Alec Baldwin’s Trump. He’s excited for summer, when he’ll get to indulge in activities he “never has time for”, such as “golf, visiting friends in prison and enjoying all the fantastic new tariffs from Gina”. After bragging about the economy, he goes into a rendition of Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, changing the lyrics from “that’s why they call me Mr Fahrenheit” to “that’s why they call me Mr Bad Advice”. He’s joined by his inner circle, including the first lady (Cecily Strong), Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), Kanye West (Chris Redd) and Wilbur Ross (Kate McKinnon), as well as Robert Mueller (Robert De Niro). Pence is especially riled up by the Queen. Muggy acting, laugh-free jokes, basic reference posing as political commentary, gay panic, an overexposed piece of pop culture – it’s the most fitting cold open possible, given the unbroken badness of the season’s introductory sketches. Avenger’s: End Game star Paul Rudd returns to hosting duties, excited to be part of “hands down the most anticipated finale of this weekend!” Having realized that opening monologues should be a mix of the funny and the heartfelt, he decides to give a best man’s speech. Champagne flute in hand, he reminisces about his history with the show, which includes a lot of onscreen making out, before toasting season 44. It’s neither particularly funny nor particularly heartfelt but it’s quick and, like Rudd, perfectly affable. 👽 Ms. Rafferty's at it again 👽#SNLFinale pic.twitter.com/wZ1RODGwGv A Journey Through Time is the latest in the popular Close Encounter series. Rudd steps into the male role previously filled by Ryan Gosling and Liev Schreiber and, with Strong, tells of a vision of a future utopia. As ever, the third member of the group, Colleen Rafferty (McKinnon), recounts a much different experience. Instead of being gently transported to the future, she was “violently sucked a million years into the past”, landing “ass up, face down in mud with my cooter and my tooter on full display” before being fondled by some cave people. There’s a strong case to be made that Rafferty is McKinnon’s best role. Extra credit to Rudd for being the first host not to break while being straddled by her. A rap from Pete Davidson starts off as a tribute to Game of Thrones, until it becomes clear he isn’t really a fan. Quickly changing gears, he decides to rap about a show he actually likes – Grace and Frankie. Featuring Rudd, musical guest DJ Khaled, Thrones actor Jacob Anderson and wordless appearances by Grace and Frankie themselves, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, it’s the first of several star-studded moments. What’s Wrong With This Picture is a game show in which contestants look at a simple drawing and guess what’s wrong with it. However, said contestants are morons who entirely misread the innocent examples. A picture of a woman trying on a hat in front of a department store mirror evokes the following guesses: “She’s 14 years old but the boobies grew too fast!” “Her twin’s in that fish tank and she can’t get out!” “She just did blackface and got away with it. The only problem is she got the job – now what?!” Next, DJ Khaled performs a medley of Jealous and You Stay, joined by Lil Wayne and Big Sean, then Meek Mill, J Balvin, Jeremih and Lil Baby. For Weekend Update, Judge Jeanine Pirro (Strong, probably her signature role) comes on to douse Colin Jost and Michael Che with martinis. Later, the two make one another read jokes written by each other, sight unseen. It’s as dark and vicious as you’d expect – especially the racial material given to Jost by Che. As was clear in an earlier example, they’re both at their best when leaning into their innate frat boy-style maliciousness. They should do this more often. Leslie Jones joins them to angrily – and justifiably – talk about abortion bans passed by Republicans in several states. She ends by encouraging women to be empowered and fight for their reproductive rights. “You can’t tell me what to do with my body.” – @Lesdoggg #SNLFinale pic.twitter.com/0g1tviKPxp Not to take away from Jones or her message, but before anyone gives SNL too much credit for taking a stand, they should recall that earlier this season the show capitulated, giving a serious boost in national prominence to Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw – as stringent an anti-abortion advocate as you’ll find in any southern statehouse. Music Box is juvenile but clever, a stealth Twilight Zone parody about an old song called Fancy Party which tells the story of a ballerina who farts at a social gathering and “the catastrophic effect it has on her life, relationships, and her dancing career”. The show briefly returns to abortion on its version of The View, before the toxically co-dependent hosts welcome 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg, played by Rudd. The Democratic long-shot claims to represent everyday Americans, because as “just a Harvard educated, multilingual, war veteran Rhodes scholar – I’m just like you!” The sketch ends with an awkward, drawn out joke about how the hosts all love Joe Biden too much. Pete Buttigieg stopped by The View. #SNLFinale pic.twitter.com/K0IQzWBcWE DJ Khaled returns to perform Just Us/Weather the Storm/Higher, with SZA, Meek Mill and John Legend. Then final sketch, Ouija, sees a group of preteen girls accidentally summon an awkward demon named Bealthor, played by Melissa Villasenior. Bealthor tries – and fails – to fit in. The pacing is off but it’s saved by Rudd’s goofy dad. And with that, SNL goes out on a middling note. Rudd was good as always and there weren’t any real low points outside the cold open. But the only thing that really made it feel like a finale were the celebrity appearances. All told, it was a fitting end to a middling season.
