I asked eBay to close my account. It said I need to clear my balance and then wait 30 days with no account activity before this could be done. This I did. At the end of 30 days, a mysterious £0.01 appeared as a credit in my balance, preventing me from closing my account. eBay had no explanation but reversed it to zero again. I was then told to wait another 30 days. The same thing happened. After 30 days another mysterious 1p appeared. I was asked to start all over again. RT, Huddersfield eBay’s explanation for your enforced loyalty is baffling. It says sums were “courtesy” refunds of a previous listing fee after two bidders reneged on their commitment to pay. The fees were £1.04 but eBay says it refunded £1.05 both times because “we calculate each fee to six decimal places, but, for ease of reading, we round these figures up to two decimal places on the ‘account status’ page, which resulted in the extra penny”. Why £1.05 is easier to read than £1.04 is unexplained. Moreover, you insist that the bidders in question had paid. eBay says it has “corrected” your balance, returning it to zero, and that, although you should technically have to wait another 30 days, it will try to speed up the process up “to help you out”.
