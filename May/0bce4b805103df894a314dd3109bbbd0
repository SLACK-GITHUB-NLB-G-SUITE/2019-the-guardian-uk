Whether you cycled off-road or on, wore full Lycra or had the kids in tow, we want to hear about great scenic cycling routes in Europe (sorry, not the UK on this occasion). It could be a self-guided tour lugging everything on your bike, or a posh package where luggage is transferred for you. Length of route isn’t important – it’s the scenery we want to hear about. Please include exact locations, and any tips on bike hire, accommodation, campsites, great viewpoints and bike-friendly cafes, bars and restaurants. They needn’t be rural – please tell us about great urban cycle routes too. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including website and prices if any) in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here.
