Johanna Konta’s hopes of winning the Italian Open were dashed as Karolina Pliskova powered her way to victory in Rome. The No 4 seed claimed her second title of the season with a 6-3, 6-4 win over the British No 1. Pliskova broke in the second game and although the unseeded Konta made life difficult and managed a breakpoint late-on, the Czech made just five unforced errors to take it 6-3. Konta’s response was concerted as the second set went with serve before Pliskova had the opportunity to establish a 4-3 lead. Despite saving three break points, she was unable to fend off the Czech a fourth time. She made it 5-3 after Konta had fought her way back to deuce and although the Briton held in the penultimate game, Pliskova converted her third championship point to take the title and secure the world No 2 spot in the new rankings on Monday. “I just hope to take the tennis I was playing here to Paris,” Pliskova said of the French Open, which begins next weekend. “For sure there’s going to be a chance for me if I play this way.” Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels
