Burglars have stolen medals and commemorative jewellery from the London 2012 Games belonging to the British Olympian Eilish McColgan, she has said. The runner said her home in Manchester was broken into on Wednesday, while she was in Sweden for a race. She said she was “upset and angry” about the break-in and distressed by the thought that “some utter scumbag has been roaming around our house – destroying it and having no regards for any of our belongings”. McColgan is a middle-distance runner who competed in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and holds Scottish records in the 5,000 metres and the 3,000-metre steeplechase. In a series of posts on social media, she listed some of the items she said the thieves had taken: This necklace is something they’ve stolen! Alongside all my other jewellery, British athletics medals and some commemorative medals from Olympics & Commonwealth Games! Please keep an eye out for these items around Manchester if you can! pic.twitter.com/xUKXZY1kFJ McColgan, who is competing in athletics’ elite Diamond League circuit in Sweden, said the break-in happened on Wednesday between 8.30am and 4pm. She said the burglars locked her dog in the living room while they “trashed” her home and searched for valuables to steal. The athlete, whose mother, Liz McColgan, is an Olympic silver medal-winner, said she called police but no officers had yet visited her house to investigate. Greater Manchester police told reporters that fewer officers meant the force had to respond based on the threat and risk posed to the public and make “difficult decisions” when prioritising calls. A spokesman said inquiries were ongoing.
