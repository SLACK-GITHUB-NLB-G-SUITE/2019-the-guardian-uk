Primoz Roglic emerged as the overwhelming favourite for the Giro d’Italia when he won the ninth stage, a 34.8km individual time trial from Riccione to San Marino. Britain’s Simon Yates, among other contenders, suffered a heavy loss of time to the Slovenian in wet conditions. The Italian Valerio Conti of Team UAE retained the overall leader’s pink jersey after finishing 3min 34sec behind the Lotto Jumbo-Visma rider Roglic, who finished in 51min 52sec. The two-times champion Vincenzo Nibali (Bahrain-Merida) of Italy limited the damage when he lost 1min 05sec, following a strong showing in the final 12.25km climb in San Marino, to take fourth place. Victor Campenaerts and Bauke Mollema finished second and third respectively. Yates took a beating as he lost 3min 11sec to Roglic, and Spain’s Miguel Ángel López ended 3min 45sec off the pace after all the general classification contenders rode in the rain. It was a spectacular reverse of fortune for Yates, who had been strong in the race-opening time trial after warning his rivals they should be scared of him. Conti, who is not among the main GC contenders, leads Roglic, winner of the first time trial, by 1min 50sec. Roglic leads Nibali by 1.44 in the GC standings going into Monday’s rest day.
