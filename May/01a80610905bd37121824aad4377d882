Seeking out the high places is often the first thing we do in a new city, to get a sense of the scale of the place and view it in all its glory. Whether you’ve tramped up hundreds of ancient steps in a thousand-year-old cathedral or shot to the top of a skyscraper in a glass lift, please tell us about your favourite city viewpoints anywhere in the world. Your tips can also include parks and gardens, roof-top bars and restaurants with city panoramas. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including prices, etc) in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
