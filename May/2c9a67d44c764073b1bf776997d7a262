Aidan O’Brien will saddle four of the 14 fillies in Friday’s Investec Oaks at Epsom as he attempts to take his record in this season’s British Classics to three-out-of-three and retain a chance to become the first trainer to win all five of the Classics in the same season. The surprise in the field, though, is that Frankie Dettori has opted for Anapurna, the Lingfield Oaks Trial winner, over Mehdaayih, who took the Cheshire Oaks earlier this month and will be ridden by Rab Havlin. Pink Dogwood, the easy winner of the Salsabil Stakes at Navan in April, is the leading contender from O’Brien’s stable and had been challenging for favouritism alongside Mehdaayih in recent weeks at around 5-2. The booking of Dettori for Anapurna, however, is likely to prompt a rush of money for a filly who was available at 10-1 in places overnight. Hills now make Pink Dogwood the 15-8 favourite, with Mehdaayih at 5-2 and Anapurna alongside William Haggas’s Maqsad on 7-1. Manuela De Vega is 11-1 to give Ralph Beckett his third Oaks success and it is 14-1 bar those five. The remaining three members of O’Brien’s squad for Friday’s race are all outsiders: Fleeting (40-1), Delphinia (50-1) and Peach Tree (50-1). It is only four years, though, since Qualify, at 50-1, gave O’Brien the fifth of his seven wins in the Oaks to date. O’Brien has already gone closer than any trainer in history to a clean sweep in the Classics, having taken the first four in 2012 before Camelot’s agonising defeat by Encke in the St Leger at Doncaster. He is priced up at around 2-5 to win Saturday’s Derby and has taken three of the last six runnings of the Leger, so success in the Oaks would make a perfect season in the British Classics – with five different horses, in all likelihood – a very live runner. Wednesday afternoon’s action is less prestigious but competitive all the same, with plenty of double-figure fields on the two Flat cards including a six-furlong sprint handicap at Hamilton where Epeius (2.20) looks like the one to back at around 8-1. Ben Haslam’s six-year-old has recorded three wins already this year on the all-weather at Newcastle but also has a course-and-distance success on his record in July last year. He produced a career-best to arrive with a typical late charge under Andrew Mullen last time and edge out a previous winner and seems sure to get the strong pace he needs to produce his best form. Charles Kingsley (2.50) has been progressing steadily so far this year and could be ready to strike in the feature event on the same card, while Kylie Rules (3.40) and Whatwouldyouknow (4.10) look best at the prices on the card at Hamilton and Oliver’s Gold (6.45) should go well over the jumps at Cartmel.
