Kyle Edmund, Britain’s last survivor in the French Open men’s draw, retired at the start of the third set of his second-round match against Pablo Cuevas after calling on the trainer. The British No 1, trailing 7-6 (3), 6-3, 2-1, indicated at the changeover that he could not continue but did not receive treatment, and left the court. He had given no indication of injury before his match, but was not moving well against the experienced Uruguayan clay-court specialist. The French Tennis Federation later confirmed he had retired with a knee problem. Edmund’s exit means Johanna Konta is the only Briton left in the singles at Roland Garros. She plays Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova in the last 32 on Friday.
