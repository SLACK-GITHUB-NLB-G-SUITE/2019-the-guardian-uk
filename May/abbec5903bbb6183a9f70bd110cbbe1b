Your correspondents seem to have slipped into regarding it as normal that a prime minister should be elected by the members of the Conservative party (Tory leadership race looms as May agrees timetable for quitting No 10, 17 May). In fact it is unprecedented and unconstitutional. Previously the choice of prime minister has been determined by MPs, either because the majority of the MPs elected by us have been from a party headed by that person or, between elections, because those elected MPs have chosen someone else. The MPs have no right to delegate that choice to party members, thereby removing the decision from the elected and accountable to the unelected and unaccountable and cutting the wider electorate out of the process. The unprecedented spectacle we are about to witness, as bystanders, is in effect a referendum on Brexit and overall government policy in which only the tiny group of people who have paid £25 to the Conservative party will be able to vote. Anyone who does not regard this as normal should sign my petition on the parliament website, “Outlaw the choosing of the prime minister by party members who are not MPs”.Dr Dorian Gerhold(A House of Commons clerk 1978-2012), Putney, London • Could a psychoanalyst comment on the significance of Theresa May’s huge chain-like necklace and bracelet (Mounting pressure from party means May’s future hinges on withdrawal bill, 16 May)?Linda GreshamBirmingham • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
