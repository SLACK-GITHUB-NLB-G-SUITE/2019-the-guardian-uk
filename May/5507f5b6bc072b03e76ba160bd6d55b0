Somerset will face the holders Hampshire in the One-Day Cup final after convincing wins over Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in Sunday’s semi-finals. Following Somerset’s crushing 147-run victory over Worcestershire 48 hours earlier, they delivered a strong, all-round performance to go through to their first Lord’s final since 2011. Peter Trego top-scored with 73 in the visitors’ 337 all out after they were asked to bat first. Azhar Ali scored 72 and Tom Banton hit a brisk 59, with Jake Ball taking four for 62 for the home side. In reply, Nottinghamshire lost wickets at regular intervals and were rarely in contention once Alex Hales had departed for 54. The opener Ben Slater made 58 but the bowlers kept things tight, with Roelof van der Merwe taking three for 29. There were still 11.4 overs remaining when they were dismissed for only 222. Jimmy Anderson left the field after taking a heavy blow to his knee as Lancashire were powerless to stop Hampshire’s charge to the final. The England paceman was four balls into his seventh over having gone wicketless as his side defended a total of 241 all out, with Gareth Berg posting career-best figures of five for 26 for Hampshire. Keaton Jennings top-scored with 63 but Lancashire’s total never seemed enough despite Hampshire falling to 23 for three in the early stages of their response. A 122-run stand between James Vince and Rilee Roussouw steadied the ship and despite a slight wobble late on, Berg and James Fuller guided defending champions Hampshire home by four wickets.
