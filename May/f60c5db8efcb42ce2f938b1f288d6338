France’s Nans Peters won stage 17 of the Giro d’Italia as overall leader Richard Carapaz gained a few extra seconds on his rivals. Peters powered clear from an 18-man breakaway with around 15 kilometres remaining of the 181km stage from Commezzadura to Anterselva Antholz. The 25-year-old Ag2r-La Mondiale rider was never in danger of being caught as he claimed his maiden win in a Grand Tour and his team’s first in the Giro since 2011. Peters finished 1min 34secs ahead of Esteban Chaves (Mitchelton-Scott), with Davide Formolo (Bora-Hansgrohe) a further 17 seconds adrift. “My Giro was already a success but it’s incredible to get my first pro win in a Grand Tour,” said Peters. “In the breakaway, I promised myself to attack only once and the timing proved to be right.” Carapaz trailed in well behind the winner but still extended his lead over Vincenzo Nibali by seven seconds to 1min 54secs, with Primoz Roglic another 22 seconds behind in third. The Ecuadorian’s Movistar teammate, Mikel Landa, attacked with three kilometres remaining to cut the gap to the top three. Landa remains fourth, but is now 3min 3secs behind Carapaz. “Mikel Landa felt good in the finale and decided to attack to gain some time for the final podium,” Carapaz said. “I also felt good and I did my best to profit from Mikel’s attack. I couldn’t have asked for a better 26th birthday than with the Maglia Rosa.” Britain’s Simon Yates remains eighth in the general classification, more than seven minutes adrift of Carapaz. 1 Nans Peters (Fr) AG2R La Mondiale 4hr 41m 34s 2 Esteban Chaves (Col) Mitchelton-Scott +1:34 3 Davide Formolo (It) Bora-Hansgrohe +1:51 4 Fausto Masnada (It) AG-Sidermec 5 Krists Neilands (Lat) Israel Cycling 6 Tanel Kangert (Est) EF Education First +2:02 7 Valerio Conti (It) UAE Team Emirates +2:08 8 Gianluca Brambilla (It) Trek-Segafredo st 9 Chris Hamilton (Aus) Sunweb +2:22 10 A Vendrame (It) AG Sidermec +2:34 1 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar 74hr 48m 18s 2 Vincenzo Nibali (It) Bahrain-Merida +1:54 3 Primoz Roglic (Svn) Jumbo-Visma +2:164 Mikel Landa (Sp) Movistar +3:03 5 Bauke Mollema (Neth) Trek-Segafredo +5:07 6 Miguel Ángel López (Col) Astana +6:177 Rafal Majka (Pol) Bora-Hansgrohe +6:48 8 Simon Yates (GB) Mitchelton-Scott +7:13 9 Pavel Sivakov (Rus) Team Ineos +8:2110 Davide Formolo (It) Bora-Hansgrohe +8:59
