We were surprised to read Suzanne Moore’s account of a visit to the Nukus Museum of Art (The Lost Louvre of Uzbekistan, 22 May), which includes the Igor Savitsky Museum. She describes the Savitsky Museum as being in a dire state where “rain comes in through a leaking roof”. While writing appreciatively of the Savitsky Collection itself, she fails to mention that there are two museum buildings in this complex, one of which has an excellent display of local history and crafts, though in a fairly archaic building. The Savitsky Collection is in a newish and attractive building far removed from the decrepit structure she describes. It is indeed one of the foremost galleries of Soviet and Uzbek art. Her further negative evaluation of the town of Nukus fails to mention the nearby colossal Mizdarkhan and Yusuf Ishan cemeteries, boasting a brilliant restored underground mausoleum and ablutions hall. We visited the museums and mausoleum a few weeks ago and believe that Moore’s article creates an unjustified bleak picture of their condition, though she is right to say they deserve national and international support.Laurence Cockcroft, Shamshad Cockcroft and Victoria BrittainLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
