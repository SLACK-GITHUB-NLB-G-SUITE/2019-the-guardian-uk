Whether they have wings or fur, beaks or antlers, wild animals hold an endless fascination for young and old alike. And this country has its fair share of opportunities for observing birds and beasts in their natural habitat – from soaring falcons to lolloping seals. This week, we want to hear about the best places for wildlife experiences in the UK, particularly those suitable for families. They could be bird reserves, rewilded farms or meadows, wildlife trust-managed woodland … any landscape that is being maintained specifically for wild things. Please include exact locations, any entry prices and other helpful practical details as well as wildlife sightings. We’re not looking for children’s farms or any type of zoo on this occasion. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including website and prices if any) in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
