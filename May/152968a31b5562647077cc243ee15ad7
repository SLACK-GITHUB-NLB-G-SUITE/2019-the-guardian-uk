My wife is now drinking a quarter of a bottle of spirits each day. Her choice at the moment is brandy, but it could be vodka or whisky, depending on what appeals. The drinking usually starts about 5pm and then the arguing starts. She won’t admit that she has a problem with alcohol at all, and says it’s just because it calms her at the end of the day. This has caused rows many times because she becomes aggressive and argumentative. We are both 78 years old, but I feel that this is breaking us down now and that we will need to separate and live our own lives, not something we should be doing at this stage in life. I keep trying to make our marriage better, but I think I have to move on as nothing works and it’s killing me.
