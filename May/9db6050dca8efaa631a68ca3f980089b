This model looks a little unsteady as she wobbles towards Frank Martin’s lens, in a photoshoot for the Guardian’s fashion pages on 6 July 1976. The reason for the shoot, which took place in London’s Holland Park, was to showcase the latest “leisurewear”, dungarees, boilersuits and jumpsuits – a “practical, enjoyable look”, according to the writer, Angela Neustatter. If jumpsuits had taken hold, then skateboarding had not. “This crazy sport,” wrote Neustatter, “has, I am told, swept California and is about to take us by storm.” Over 40 years later, all-in-ones are having another moment, thanks in large part to the jumpsuit worn by Fleabag, AKA Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Proof that fashion is always cyclical. Words: Hannah Booth Buy your exclusive print here Price £50, including free delivery.
