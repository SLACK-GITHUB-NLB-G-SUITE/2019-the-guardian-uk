These are fairies or ladies or whatever you want them to be; play about with their hairstyles and faces to give them their own character. They are great fun for a party. You could make them to resemble all your friends! Prep time: 15-20 minsBaking time: 60-90 minsDecorating time: 10 minsMakes: 15 For the meringue80g egg white (2-3 large eggs)Pinch of cream of tartar140g caster sugarPink gel food dye PlusWhite chocolateSprinklesBlack food dyeVodka or ginMarzipan or fondantIcing sugar Preheat the oven to 100C/90C fan/210F/gas mark Â¼. Whisk the egg whites until foamy, then add the cream of tartar and continue whisking until you have soft peaks. Add the caster sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking well after each addition until you have a stiff, glossy mixture. Divide the mixture equally between two bowls, and dye one bowl pink. Transfer all the pink meringue mixture to a piping bag with a large, round nozzle attachment, and most of the white meringue to a similar bag, saving two to three tablespoons of it to go in a third piping bag with a small tip. Pipe 15 blobs of the pink meringue on to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Use the larger bag of white meringue to pipe a smaller blob on top of each of these. Dip your finger in water and smooth down the tips of the meringues. Use the smallest piping bag to pipe little dots to look like arms. Bake for 60-90 minutes (depending on whether or not you want a soft centre). Then leave to cool before decorating. Melt white chocolate and dip the base of the meringues into it. Cover with sprinkles before the chocolate sets. Paint faces using black food dye mixed with a little vodka or gin. Roll out coloured fondant or marzipan on a surface sprinkled with a little icing sugar. Use small flower-shaped cutters to stamp out little hats. Arrange these on top of the meringues, securing them with a little leftover melted chocolate.
