The Italian rider Damiano Cima won the 18th stage of the Giro d’Italia after a thrilling sprint finish in Santa Maria di Sala. It was Cima’s first stage victory in the race, ensuring a memorable day for him and his team, Nippo-Vini Fantini-Faizane. “I can’t believe what just happened,” Cima said afterwards. “I’ve spent so many kilometers in breakaways during this Giro. I thought I’d never make it but I’ve won today. It’s insane. It’s the dream of a lifetime.” Germany’s Pascal Ackermann finished second, with another Italian, Simone Consonni, taking third following the 222km stage from Valdaora. Cima broke clear of the peloton with Nico Denz and Mirco Maestri, and he held his nerve despite escalating pressure to edge out a frustrated Ackermann after Denz and Maestri were caught. The overall classification remained unchanged, with Ecuador’s Richard Carapaz taking a lead approaching two minutes into Friday’s 19th stage. Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali retained second spot, while Primoz Roglic is a further 22 seconds back in third. The British challengers Simon Yates and Hugh Carthy hold eighth and 13th positions respectively. “It’s been a quiet stage but a long one, intense at the beginning only,” said the race leader Carapaz, who rides for Movistar. “I’ve had a good support from my team again. Tomorrow will be an important test but I’m confident to keep the Maglia Rosa.” The Giro heads back into the mountains for Friday’s 18th stage, a 151-km route from Treviso, with an uphill finish to San Martino di Castrozza. The three-week race finishes in Verona on Sunday.
