Daniel Craig requires surgery on an ankle he injured during the filming of the new James Bond film, putting him out of action for at least two weeks. The official James Bond social media account announced the news, saying production would continue while Craig “rehabilitates”. BOND 25 update: Daniel Craig will be undergoing minor ankle surgery resulting from an injury sustained during filming in Jamaica. Production will continue whilst Craig is rehabilitating for two weeks post-surgery. The film remains on track for the same release date in April 2020. pic.twitter.com/qJN0Sn4gEx Reports had emerged last week from the film’s set in Jamaica that Craig had slipped during the shooting of an action sequence and had been flown to the US for treatment. Filming the following weekend had been cancelled but now appears to have restarted. Producers say there will be no change to the planned release date in 2020. The setback is the latest to affect Bond 25. In 2018, director Danny Boyle unexpectedly dropped out due to “creative differences” and was replaced by Cary Fukunaga. A comprehensive script overhaul has seen a string of writers work on the project, including veteran Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, Scott Z Burns and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
