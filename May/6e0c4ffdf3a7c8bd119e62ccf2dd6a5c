With a weary Kawhi Leonard fighting through fatigue, the Toronto Raptors found enough energy to pull away from the Milwaukee Bucks. Kyle Lowry led the way. He scored 25 points, Leonard had 19 and the Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 120-102 on Tuesday night to even the Eastern Conference finals at two games apiece. “This was one of the nights that we knew Kawhi was a little bit limited and we had to come out and be aggressive for him,” Lowry said. Leonard played 52 minutes in a double-overtime win in Game 3 on Sunday despite dealing with leg soreness. He limped away from the basket following a third-quarter dunk in Game 4, but still toughed it out for 34 minutes. “I feel good,” Leonard insisted. “I’m going to keep going and keep fighting. We have a chance to make history.” Danforth Special pic.twitter.com/g8Dc1IZHXv Raptors coach Nick Nurse said he’s not worried about Leonard’s health. “He’s certainly tired, like a lot of guys in this series are,” Nurse said. “He looks OK to me. There was one time I was trying to give him an extended rest and he didn’t really want it so he must be OK.” Giannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the top-seeded Bucks. Khris Middleton scored 30 points, but no one else had more than 11. Milwaukee lost their second straight following a six-game winning streak. “This is probably the first night defensively where I don’t feel like we were close to where you need to be,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We got punched. They played really well.”
