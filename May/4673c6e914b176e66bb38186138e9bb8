Johanna Konta defeated the sixth-seeded Kiki Bertens 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 in nearly three hours to reach the Italian Open final for the biggest clay-court result of her career. Konta’s only previous final on clay came recently in Rabat, Morocco, where she was beaten by Greece’s Maria Sakkari. This result in Rome against the player who last week won the Madrid Open title will give the British player even more confidence entering the French Open, which starts next weekend. In Sunday’s final, Konta will face either fourth-seeded Karolina Pliskova or Sakkari. Midway through the first set, Konta surprised Bertens with a drop shot winner during a baseline rally, causing Bertens to fall on her stomach to the clay as she rapidly changed directions. Then in the next game, Konta ran down a drop shot and produced an angled winner that drew a roar from the Foro Italico crowd. The 42nd-ranked Konta served for the first set at 5-4 but was broken at love. But Bertens double faulted to let Konta serve for the second set and Konta got an early break in the third.
