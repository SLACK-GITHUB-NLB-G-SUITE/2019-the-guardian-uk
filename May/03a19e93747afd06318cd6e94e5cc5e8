A 23-year-old transgender woman who was seen on a widely circulated video being beaten in front of a crowd of people has been found shot dead in Dallas. Police said the body of Muhlaysia Booker was found in a street on Saturday and that no suspect was immediately identified. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators said there was no apparent link to the 12 April beating Booker suffered after she was involved in a minor traffic accident. A cellphone recording showed her being beaten by a man as a crowd watched. Authorities said the man was offered $200 to attack Booker. Video of the incident was shared on social media. A 29-year-old man was arrested and jailed on suspicion of aggravated assault.
