The major winners on the first day of the Chester May meeting, Sir Dragonet and Mehdaayih, both looked like very credible Group One winners at some point this season, and possibly as soon as Epsom’s Classic meeting next month. Yet the familiar sequence of trials which makes this such a fascinating time of year for racing fans has only just begun, and this afternoon’s Dee Stakes could stamp another ticket to Epsom as Circus Maximus (2.25), a close fourth behind the 2,000 Guineas winner Magna Grecia in last year’s Vertem Trophy at Doncaster, makes his seasonal debut. Looking at the entries for both the Dee Stakes and Wednesday’s Chester Vase that morning, it seemed that this could be the more significant trial of the pair. That, of course, was before Sir Dragonet – a “sleeper” in the stable, as Paul Smith, the son of his co-owner Derrick, described him – bolted up later in the day, but there are still decent grounds to hope that Circus Maximus too is a credible Derby candidate in waiting. He may have gone through his first season of racing with only a single victory in a heavy ground maiden at Gowran Park in the win column, but his pedigree – by Galileo out of a dual Royal Ascot winner – is outstanding and made for middle-distances at three. He was just a length behind Magna Grecia at Doncaster and can only benefit for a step up to 10 furlongs this time. Fox Chairman, a recent impressive winner of a Newbury maiden, is an interesting opponent but all the money has been for Circus Maximus on Thursday morning and he should get the job done ahead of a date with the best of his generation at Epsom. Elsewhere on Thursday’s Chester card, Magic Circle (3.35), last year’s Chester Cup winner, could be worth chancing against Kew Gardens, last season’s Leger winner, when they make their seasonal debuts in the Group Three Ormonde Stakes. Ian Williams’s gelding had a disappointing conclusion to last season when he finished well back in the Melbourne Cup, reportedly after breaking a blood vessel. His previous run at Sandown in May was a top-class effort, however, and he gets a very useful 7lb from Kew Gardens, enough to make him the top-rated runner in the race at the weights. Lincoln Park (3.00) has a handy draw in three for the seven-furlong handicap and should be able to grab the rail, and while stall eight would normally be a big negative for a front-runner like Reflektor (1.50) in the sprint, there is a non-runner just inside him and less early pace than might be expected towards the rail.
