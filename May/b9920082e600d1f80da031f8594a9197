Norwich City have won the Championship title after winning 2-1 away at Aston Villa, while rivals Sheffield United were held to a 2-2 draw at Stoke City. Mario Vrancic’s 86th-minute strike ensured a jubilant day for Canaries fans, although given events at Stoke, a point would ultimately have been enough for Daniel Farke’s side. Chris Wilder’s Sheffied United came from behind to level at 2-2 but have to be content with automatic promotion and second place. Leeds finished third despite a shock 3-2 defeat to relegated Ipswich, who scored a 90th-minute winner through Collin Quaner after having Luke Chambers sent off with 11 to go. Middlesbrough won 2-1 at Rotherham through a Britt Assombaloga penalty and Mikel John Obi’s 37th-minute strike, but Derby’s 3-1 win over West Brom meant they were unable to make the top six. Bristol City needed to win and for results elsewhere to go in their favour, but ultimately they were held to a 1-1 draw by Hull City, despite being help edan injury-time own goal from Hull’s Markus Henriksen.
