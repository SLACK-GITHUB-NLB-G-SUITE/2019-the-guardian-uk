Borussia Dortmund made a double signing on Wednesday, announcing the arrival of Julian Brandt from Bayer Leverkusen hours after the striker Thorgan Hazard joined from Borussia Mönchengladbach. Hazard, the younger brother of Chelsea’s Eden, had been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge or Liverpool but has chosen to remain in Germany and has cost Dortmund £22.5m. The fee for Brandt, a Germany international, is understood to be €25m (£22.1m). The 23-year-old forward has signed a contract to 2024. “He is still a young player with great development potential,” Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, said of Brandt. “He can be used in a number of attacking positions and will enrich our game with his creativity.” Hazard, a 26-year-old Belgium international, has also signed a five-year deal. He scored 13 goals and provided assists for 12 more in 35 matches for Mönchengladbach last season. Hazard told Dortmund’s website: “I am grateful for five great years at Borussia Mönchengladbach and very nice memories. This was the perfect time to take the next step in my career. I am proud to play for Borussia Dortmund, a top club with incredible fans.” Commenting on the move, Zorc said: “We are delighted that Thorgan has decided to go with Borussia Dortmund. He is a seasoned Bundesliga player and Belgian national player, who will help us with his pace and quality of finishing, the proof has been provided.” Dortmund, who finished second in the Bundesliga last season, have already signed Nico Schulz from Hoffenheim for £22m and Mateu Morey from Barcelona on a free. They have sold Christian Pulisic to Chelsea for £58m.
