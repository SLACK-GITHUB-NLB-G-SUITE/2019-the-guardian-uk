Rosie Lowe’s 2016 major label debut, Control, explored the need to retain – and occasionally, learn to relinquish – power, especially relating to a woman in the music industry. Three years and a switch from Polydor to Adele/Florence producer Paul Epworth’s indie label later, the 29-year-old Devon-born Londoner slightly changes tack. When YU– pronounced ‘You’ and also ‘Why You’ – investigates the same themes, it’s within a relationship. It’s an album about love: insecurities, desire, contentment and the shifting balance of power. Her vehicle, again, is smooth, sultry, minimalist, electronic soul and R&B, somewhere between James Blake and Sade or Minnie Ripperton. There’s a hushed stillness to the way Lowe’s words glide over the stripped-down, becalmed grooves, before gentle soul gives way to more uptempo beats and sentiments. With that template, it’s a varied mix. Pharoah first describes love as a sanctity from city pressures, before gently asserting feminine empowerment: “Power in my mouth, in the imperfections that made me.” Birdsong assembles a starry choir (Jamie Woon, Jamie Liddell and Kwabs) for a song that is the epitome of slinky. It’s all classy, sensual stuff which – as her old major label may have concluded – is more about subtle charms than chart-steamrollering bangers. Standout Itily is a delicate, fragile wonder about initial infatuation. The Way is an unabashed, devotional love song, before guest rapper Jay Electronica’s unfortunate double entendre (“Lost my ring in some club in Camden”) somewhat jars with the beguiling mood.
