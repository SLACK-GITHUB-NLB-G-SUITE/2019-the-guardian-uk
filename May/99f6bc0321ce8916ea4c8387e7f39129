To those thinking of resigning from the Labour party (Letters, 30 May), don’t. At least not yet. You’ll be depriving yourselves of voting for the next leader.Val PriorHorndean, Hampshire • Paul Mason (Corbynism is in crisis. Labour will have to oppose Brexit, 28 May), gave plenty of attention to the name of Corbyn (and to his derelictions) but only once, and fleetingly, to Keir Starmer’s. When is his name going to get the attention it deserves? No more letting the bow sleep in his hand! His virtues, of courage and intellect, are exactly those we need now.Jinty NelsonLondon • I see that MacKenzie Bezos is planning to give away around £14.2bn (Report, 29 May). Before she starts the handouts, shouldn’t she give at least £2-3bn to our very own HMRC to cover all the taxes that Amazon has avoided paying in the UK since it has been operating over here? This money could then be used to revive our high street shops.Jonathan CockburnLydney, Gloucestershire • I’ve been thinking about Lord Paul’s justification for getting paid for “thinking, etc, and giving my advice to colleagues” (Report, 31 May). After a lot of thought, I decided that they should sack ’em all. That’s my advice. Please pay £305.Marcia SaundersLondon • My father’s copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover (Letters, 28 May), acquired well before it was legal in the UK, came in plain covers with the title L’architecture Française de Jean Mariette and a lengthy introduction by DH Lawrence written in Paris in April 1929, in which he disparages all previous pirated editions and refers to the present book as “this little cheap French edition … offered at 60 francs”.Adrian HattrellDoncaster, South Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
