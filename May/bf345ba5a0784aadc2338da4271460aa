Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’d like to start growing herbs hydroponically, all year round. Is there a good, reasonably priced starter kit to buy, or can I build a DIY version for less? Any herb experts out there who can pass on what they’ve learned? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions tomoney@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
