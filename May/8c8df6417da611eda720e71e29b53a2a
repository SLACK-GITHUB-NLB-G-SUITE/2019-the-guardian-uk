A huge dust storm blanketed the north-west Victorian town of Mildura on Tuesday afternoon, turning daylight to midnight in a matter of minutes as the front blew in from the west. Tanvi Mor, who was at the airport when the storm came in about 5pm, said “it seemed to be swallowing Mildura”. Mor said it was Mildura’s worst dust storm in 40 years. Pictures and video posted on social media showed vast clouds of dust towering over the town. The North Star Mildura Motors salesman Shaun Blythman said the dealership was scrambling to clean 100 cars coated in a chocolate brown film on Wednesday morning.

He said initially it looked like a big thunderstorm was coming and then it went pitch black. “It was like a thick wall,” Blythman said. A senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, Richard Carlyon, said it was uncommon to have a dust storm in May. Before and after of Mildura #duststorm at 5pm today.
