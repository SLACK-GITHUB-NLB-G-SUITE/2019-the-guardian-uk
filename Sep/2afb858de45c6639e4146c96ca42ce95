The sad demise of Bury FC is more than a comment on professional football (Report, 30 August). The labyrinthine financial practices at Bury are a symptom of the UK financial system and the morality of business practice. Even if those involved have done nothing illegal, and “everything … has been done properly”, there is something deeply wrong with business practice where debt can be run up so disastrously and profit can be made from it. Bury’s problems are being repeated in other parts of the economy where businesses are in trouble: retail, manufacturing, media and many others. The only difference is that Bury is a football club. I almost look forward to the first school academy business or privatised medical organisation collapsing. Meanwhile, our government is rushing us to leave the EU so that our business leaders can have even more freedom from financial regulation and its enforcement.Steve LuptonPrestwich, Greater Manchester • Supporters of Bury FC need not despair. They should take comfort from the example of Rangers FC, which went into liquidation in 2012. A new company was formed, it bought Ibrox Stadium from the liquidators and was granted permission to enter the Scottish league at its lowest level. A mere seven years later and the new Rangers have just qualified for the Europa League group stages and are second in the Scottish Premiership. Mike PenderCardiff • Bury FC’s eviction from the league is sad. The club featured some years ago in a Guardian cryptic crossword clue. The clue was simply: “Bury F.C. (5)”. Not necessarily difficult, but certainly witty.Andrew BibbyHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
