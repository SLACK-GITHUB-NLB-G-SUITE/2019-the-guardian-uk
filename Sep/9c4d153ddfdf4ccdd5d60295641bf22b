Sheffield Wednesday have announced the appointment of Garry Monk as the club’s new manager. Monk replaces Steve Bruce, who left Sheffield Wednesday to take charge of Newcastle United at the start of the season. The 40-year-old has been out of work since being sacked by Birmingham in June having guided the club to 17th in the Championship last season. Lee Bullen was in interim charge of Wednesday for their first six league games of the season, winning three to leave them 11th in the league table. Monk, who as a player had a loan spell at Wednesday during the 2002-03 season, will take charge for the first time away at Huddersfield on 15 September. He said: “My overriding feeling is excitement and what we can do here. We know we have a capable squad and it’s about making us compete as hard as we can. I was a player here many moons ago and even though it was a short spell, I got a good grasp of how powerful and traditional this club is. “There are big clubs in this league, like this one, with tradition and history and to be part of that history is an honour. You look at it like that as a manager. The overriding factor is I’m excited. I want to come here and get to work and get started with what we feel is a capable squad. “We want to move it forward and see what we can do. When you look at it at the start of the season there’s probably 13 or 14 [teams] that target promotion. The process has to be day-by-day improvement, improve the squad we have in terms of what we do on the pitch and take it step-by-step.”
