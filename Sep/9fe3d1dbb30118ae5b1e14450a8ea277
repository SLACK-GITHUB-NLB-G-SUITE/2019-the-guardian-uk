What time are you up? We’ve got an 18-month-old, so I’m up between 6.45 and 7am with him. I have about 30 seconds to pee and brush my teeth before getting upstairs to his bedroom. Then I’ll saunter to the kitchen to put the kettle on and change a nappy. Breakfast or brunch? Both. The joy of getting up early is two breakfasts, that’s the key to a good Sunday. ‘In breakfast’ is small and early, then it’s time for ‘out breakfast’. Anything with salt beef or smoked salmon and I’m sold. Do you work? I worked on Sundays for six years; now I don’t, so I can switch off the news. I love the Sunday papers, but I’ll only read the supplements. I don’t do news on a Sunday. What were Sundays like as a kid? Consumed by day trips, usually at English Heritage sites around Manchester, or to Blackpool to see my grandpa. I’m an only child, so I could bring a friend. Sunday extravagance? I love a massage. All week I’m stressed. Someone sorting my back out is a real treat. How do you relax? Drinking: early and often is my motto. Sunday secret? I’ve discovered the pleasures of afternoon napping. On Saturdays I still feel a pressure to make the most of the weekend. On a Sunday I feel you have total permission to do what you want. Last thing you look at on your phone before bed? I’ll read the Politico Sunday Crunch email to catch up on what’s been happening, and read the briefs from my team for the following day. Then I’ll mooch around interior design sites until I fall asleep looking at rugs. I need new rugs, but I never seem to buy them.
