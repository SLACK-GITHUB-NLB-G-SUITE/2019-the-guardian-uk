As a resident of central Edinburgh for nearly 50 years, I’m entirely with Tom Rasmussen on banning silent discos (G2, 18 September). For one thing they are far from silent to those living in the tenements lining the streets. Do Abba fans want to hear mangled lyrics sung by half-cut tourists? This may, or may not be a beautiful experience if “in a confined space where others are not disturbed”, but central Edinburgh is not that space. Hordes of up to 50 revellers, forcing pedestrians on to the roads and poking fun at street dwellers by dancing round them – is that really part of the Fringe ethos, rather than a highly commercial outfit marketing “fun”? It is just a small example of how overtourism is killing the heart of this World Heritage site and driving the community out. Will it take a reveller being killed as they dash across the red light to keep up with the rest of their party to make people question the appropriateness of silent discos?

I cannot hope to convey the sheer joy, nay euphoria, which I experienced. £15 had seemed expensive (we had seen plays and circus shows for half the price) but I can truly say that it was one of the best experiences of my life. It was utterly liberating and extraordinarily uplifting. Down with these naysayers, they obviously haven’t tried it!Emily CohenIslip, Oxfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
