After the Chicago Bears’ offense was slow to get going this season, Mitchell Trubisky was excited to speed things up. Trubisky and the Bears used a no-huddle, hurry-up tempo to snap out of their offensive funk and score 28 first-half points on the way to beating Washington 31-15 on Monday night. After no passing touchdowns in the first two games of the season, Trubisky connected with Taylor Gabriel on three of them in the second quarter alone. The 2017 second overall pick looked at ease with a fast-paced approach and picked apart Washington’s porous defense on 25 of 31 passing for 231 yards. It was the offensive explosion Trubisky predicted would happen this week. “It just felt like the tempo helped us out a little bit,” Trubisky said. “If everyone just continues to stick together and execute our plays and believe and just go out there and make plays, it’ll be a fun offense.” Chicago (2-1) had just a one-yard touchdown run to show for their first two games, and Trubisky entered the night with a completion percentage of 58.3% and ranked near the bottom of the league in yards per attempt. Facing Washington brought out the best in Trubisky. “Hat’s off to him,” said Washington linebacker Cole Holcomb, who was roommates with Trubisky at North Carolina. “I always knew he was a good quarterback. He struggled a little bit, but he came out and he played a good game.” The Bears took advantage of five turnovers by Washington quarterback Case Keenum: two interceptions by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, including a pick six, another by Kyle Fuller and fumbles forced by Khalil Mack and Danny Trevathan. “That’s all me,” said Keenum, who was 30 of 43 for 331 yards and two touchdowns that didn’t compensate for the turnovers. “Turn it over that many times as a quarterback, I let my team down. It’s all on me. I take complete responsibility. I have to take care of the ball better.”
