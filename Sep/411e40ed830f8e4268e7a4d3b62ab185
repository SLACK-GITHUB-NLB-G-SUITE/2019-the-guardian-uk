Losing an empire and looking for a role in shaping our international future in 2019 should attract those attending the Last Night of the Proms to singing the following: “Lands of hope and hazard / One world for all life / May we be your safeguard / Curbing greed and strife / (Repeat) / Honour nature’s boundaries! / End the waste of war! We can guard Earth’s riches / Now and evermore / (Repeat).” While waving their copies of the Guardian.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire • In the light of the looming climate emergency, should the British Airways pilots not be lauded for stopping hundreds of flights a day (BA begins to cancel flights as second pilots’ strike looms, 13 September)?David HalleyHampton Hill, London • “Crash out of Europe” is an emotive term used by opponents of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. It is, however, not possible to crash out of something, since the word “crash” describes a collision rather than a separation. A crash is also an unexpected event, not something that takes years of argument to achieve. Perhaps “wriggle out of the EU” would be more accurate.Chris BocciFreshford, Somerset • You say Jadon Sancho, born in 2000, is the “first player born in the 21st century to score for England” (Kosovo give error-strewn England a scare on night of hits and misses, 11 September). That would be true were it not for the fact that the 21st century began in 2001.Nicholas Q GoughSwindon, Wiltshire • Elle Hunt’s article about love being a numbers game was interesting (G2, 10 September). 831 is the number I use to sign off my texts to my wife, ie, eight letters, three words, one meaning – I love you.Tony LeatherSouth Shields, South Tyneside • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
