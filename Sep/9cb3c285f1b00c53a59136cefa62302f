I am a single mother in my mid-30s and have been dating a nice, funny guy (an old bachelor type) for nearly a year. I am a passionate person and have orgasms with him very easily. However, he doesn’t want to commit, get married or deepen our relationship in any sense. When we talk, he just keeps joking. At the same time, he needs my assistance in losing weight, for example. I am losing interest in being intimate with him. How can I explain that I need a deeper, mature relationship with him to continue our sex life? I can’t go on like a teenager living only in the now. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
