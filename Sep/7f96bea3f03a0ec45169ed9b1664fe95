What’s going for it? Grander than you might think, Lancaster, if you think about it at all. Only intrepid tour coaches make it this far, leaving this slightly forgotten city of excellent pubs, doughty inhabitants and beautiful buildings largely for the Lancastrians. Its severe castle, high on the hill, looks ripped enough to withstand a meteorite, while the streets and squares below, curling round the foot of Castle Hill and spreading up to Dalton Square and the Town Hall, are thick with columned porticoes, churches and stone Georgian townhouses. This grandeur came at a cost, of course, one mostly paid by slaves. Lancaster was once the fourth largest slave trade port in England after London, Liverpool and Bristol, a fact it finally acknowledged in 2005 with a memorial to the millions amid the warehouses and wharves on St George’s Quay. Far more searing, though, is a tiny 18th-century grave to a slave who died soon after arriving, lonely amid salt marshes by the seashore just outside the city, at Sunderland Point. Residents and schoolchildren tend it still, with flowers and painted stones. The case against… More could be made of the city’s riverfront; and recent developments and buildings don’t live up to the city’s heritage. Well connected? Trains: on the west coast mainline to Preston (16-20 mins) and Manchester (1hr). Driving: the M6 swoops past, making Preston 40 mins away, Blackpool 50 mins, the Lakes or the Dales 40 mins and Manchester 70 mins. The beach at Morecambe is 10 minutes down the road. Schools Primaries: alongside many rated “good” by Ofsted, Scotforth St Paul’s CofE and St Bernadette’s Catholic are “outstanding”. Secondaries: Central Lancaster High and Our Lady’s Catholic are “good”, with Ripley St Thomas CofE, Lancaster Girls’ Grammar and Lancaster Royal Grammar (boys) “outstanding”. Hang out at… The Borough is the local star, fine in its Georgian splendour. The Sun pulls an excellent pint. Where to buy The old heart of Georgian houses, grand and humble, tumbles down from the castle. Glorious to explore. There’s a dense ring of Victorian properties, too, around the centre and on the roads out of town – for example, off Greaves and Scotforth Roads south and west. A nice little nugget of houses is to be found by the river, around Portland Road. Also south, near the university campus. There’s a fair number of 1960s to 1980s suburbans located close to the M6.
