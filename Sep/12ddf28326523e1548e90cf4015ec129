Spain have captured their second Basketball World Cup, defeating Argentina 95-75 on Sunday to give Marc Gasol a rare double-title year. Ricky Rubio scored 20 points and Sergio Llull added 15 for Spain, the ninth team to make it through a World Cup or world championship unbeaten. Gasol scored 14 for the winners, who never trailed and added this crown to the one they claimed in 2006. For Gasol, it was historic. The Toronto Raptors center becomes the second player to win an NBA title and a Fiba world gold medal in the same year, joining Lamar Odom who did it for the Los Angeles Lakers and USA Basketball in 2010. When Spain won its first title in 2006, it was Pau Gasol Marc’s older brother leading the way. This time, it was the not-so-little brother who led his nation to gold, hoisting the World Cup trophy three months after getting his hands on the NBA’s Larry O’Brien Trophy for the first time. In the bronze medal match, France beat Australia 67-59. France caused the upset of the tournament when they beat the reigning champions, USA, in the quarter-finals.
