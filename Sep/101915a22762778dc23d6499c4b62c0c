When Aditi Mittal made her UK debut two years ago, it was with a lightweight guide to India for outsiders. You get a sharper picture of her native country from her new show, Mother of Invention – ostensibly about her relationship with her mum, but also about being an irreverent female comic in a traditionalist country. It delivers a vivid impression of how transgressive Mittal’s work must seem back home, even if her material doesn’t generate quite the same frisson in Soho. The show begins at a “fempowerment” charity event, where Mittal is accepting an award – to please her mum – in lieu of payment. But her gag about “sanitary napkins” offends a male audience member at the event, who spits at her – one of many occasions when she irritates chauvinists in her crowd. Happily, she has a template of devil-may-care femininity in her mum who breached social convention to adopt Mittal and later rides “groin first” to the rescue when the comedian’s loose tongue threatens to land her in jail. All of which conjures a grim India, where Mittal’s commitment to gender equality seems radical, and cattle are better protected by the law than human females. She lands a few choice blows, such as her line about attention-seeking women being taken too seriously and serious women being dismissed as attention-seekers. To western ears, the material on Hinduism and cows fits awkwardly with the mothering theme, and Mittal’s equation of economic with social power supplies a weak ending. A long teenage anecdote about losing a camera, meanwhile, is un-anchored and punchline-free. An occasionally sparky set, then, whose tinderbox is half a world away. • At Soho theatre, London, until 14 September.
