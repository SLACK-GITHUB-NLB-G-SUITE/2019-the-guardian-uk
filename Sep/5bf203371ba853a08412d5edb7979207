Millions of young people around the globe are expected to protest on 20 September in a bid to ask politicians take more action on the climate crisis. Climate strikes will take place in every continent, with the movement’s inspiration, environmental activist Greta Thunberg attending the rally in New York City. In the UK, dozens of protests are set to take place in cities including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Leeds. We’d like to hear from young people, parents, teachers and others who taking to the streets in the UK to demand further action is taken to tackle our climate emergency. In particular, we’d love to hear from those who are taking part in a climate strike for the first time outside of London. We’d like to hear from young people and adults who’re planning on taking part. Why do you feel compelled to take part in the climate strikes? Have you taken part in similar protests before? Which protest are you attending? Who will you be attending with? If you’re under 16, you will need to obtain permission from a parent or Guardian before we can publish your submission.
