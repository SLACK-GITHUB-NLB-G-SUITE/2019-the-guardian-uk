The prosecution of a former soldier accused of two murders on Bloody Sunday has reached a courtroom for the first time. The case of “Soldier F”, who also faces five attempted murder charges in relation to the shootings in Derry on 30 January 1972, was heard before a district judge in Derry magistrates court. The case was adjourned to 4 December to allow defence and prosecution to prepare for the committal proceedings. The district judge, Barney McElholm, granted an interim anonymity order to continue the protection of the accused’s identity. He said he accepted it would “take some time” before the committal could proceed. “It’s important that this is all done with a degree of fairness to all concerned in these matters,” he said. The decision to prosecute the ex-paratrooper was announced by the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service in March. He was not required to attend court at this stage of the criminal proceedings and did not do so. Bloody Sunday became one of the most notorious incidents of the Northern Ireland Troubles when members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire on a crowd of civil rights demonstrators, killing 13 people. Soldier F is accused of murdering James Wray and William McKinney. He also stands accused of the attempted murders of Patrick O’Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. He faces a seventh supporting charge of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown on the day. Relatives of those killed on Bloody Sunday walked together to court for Wednesday morning’s hearing. They assembled in the Diamond area of the city before walking together up Bishop Street to the courthouse. Police closed the road to facilitate the walk. Liam Wray, the brother of James Wray, said it was a “historic day”.
