Pawnbroker Albemarle & Bond has been criticised for “woefully inadequate” communication with customers after the company closed its shops and website last Friday. The National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA), the UK trade body of which Albemarle & Bond is a member, said it was receiving hundreds of calls a day from concerned customers who had been unable to get through to a helpline set up by the pawnbroker. Ray Perry, NPA chief executive, said there were only 10 people working in Albemarle & Bond’s contact centre and they had been overwhelmed by demands for information. A statement on the company’s website said that it would transfer all existing accounts to its pawnbroking centre and would not sell any items without first speaking to customers. We’d like to hear from from both staff and customers affected by the closure of the pawnbroker’s shops. If you’re a client, have you managed to retrieve any items or are you having difficulty communicating with the company via its hotline or by email? If you’re a staff member, we’d like to find out more information about your leaving terms such as whether you have been offered redundancy pay or back pay.
