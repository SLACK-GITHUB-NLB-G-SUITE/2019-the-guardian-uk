I’ve been Luke’s sole carer since he was a toddler. His mother and I didn’t live together, and she died in 2014, so it’s been a struggle. When he was about seven we were at an arcade and he dropped a coin on the floor but couldn’t find it to pick it up. That’s when we started to find out he had a sight condition (retinitis pigmentosa). It wasn’t a total surprise because RP is in the family on his mother’s side. Now he accepts it, but when he was diagnosed at 10 he refused to. He only recently agreed to having a teaching assistant with one-to-one learning. He has a white stick but never uses it. Many a time I’ve told him off for knocking things over – you forget. Five minutes later, I’m apologising for flaring up. There’s minimal furniture so he can move around OK, and I’ve also had the house steps painted white on the edge. I don’t really identify as visually impaired. It’s not a big part of my life and I don’t want to be told I’m limited. I don’t use a stick or have a guide dog. My dad is worried that I might get injured but I’ve developed coping mechanisms and know my limits. The effect of my condition is worse at night. I tend to look at the ground to use my peripheral vision, but sometimes walk into posts. I usually hold on to someone’s arm at night, but I find that a bit embarrassing. I do a lot of volunteering – my local athletics club, the National Citizen Service, the local youth council. Guide Dogs has really helped. I don’t think I’d be volunteering without them, they’ve acted as a great motivator. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
