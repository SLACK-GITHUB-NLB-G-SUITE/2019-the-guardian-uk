A man has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence following an incident outside the constituency office of the Labour MP Jess Phillips, in which the suspect is reported to have banged on the windows and shouted “fascist”. Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, said her staff had to be locked in the office while the man tried to smash the windows. She told LBC Radio: “I’ve only just heard about it myself, but my staff had to be locked into my office while the man tried to smash the windows and kick the door, I believe. “I don’t know what I can say because the man has been arrested. But he was shouting that I was a fascist, apparently.” West Midlands police confirmed a 36-year-old man had been arrested outside the office on Yardley Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham. The incident came after Phillips tabled an urgent question to the Commons on the subject of inflammatory language. Phillips has frequently spoken about the abuse she has received at the hands of internet trolls, including threats of rape. After the prime minister, Boris Johnson, denied accusations that his language was being appropriated by abusers, Phillips shared an image of a death threat she had received on paper that read: “It was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: ‘I would rather be found dead in a ditch.’ That is what will happen to those who do not deliver Brexit.” A statement by West Midlands police said: “Police were called to reports of a disturbance outside an address on Yardley Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham just before 2.25pm this afternoon [26 September]. “A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and possession of cannabis. He’s been taken into police custody and will be questioned in due course.”
