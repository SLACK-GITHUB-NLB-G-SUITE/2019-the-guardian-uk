Peter Doig’s paintings have the heightened feel of dreams and movie stills, meshing the landscape and people of his adopted home of Trinidad with personal history and pop culture. He’s also deeply aware of the implications of his position as a white man and cultural imposter in Trinidad: something his recent series of Bather paintings seem to particularly wrestle with. They are inspired by an early 1940s photo of a young Robert Mitchum – tanned, muscular and in tight trunks. The playboy film star visited Trinidad in the 1950s, then recorded a calypso album, posing with a rum and a pin-up girl on the record sleeve. Bather (Night Waves) from 2019 is Doig’s most unsettling interpretation: the man’s face is composed of gawky, ghoulish smudges, his body striped with shadows and the hands small and anxiously clasped. The post-coital Gauguin-esque woman behind him poses as if she’s just had a dreaded medical exam, while turning towards a silhouette imprinted on the hot, orange plane.
