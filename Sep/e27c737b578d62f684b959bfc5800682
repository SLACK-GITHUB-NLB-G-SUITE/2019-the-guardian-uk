You say Margaret Atwood’s childhood “was spent in the Canadian wilderness” (Interview, 21 September). Only partly. She spent half the year in the bush and half at school in Toronto, a circumstance that contributed to her fascination with dichotomies and gave her the objectivity to recognise and analyse power politics, especially as they affect girls and women. The late 40s and 50s being an era of deadening conformity, Canada and the world should be grateful to the Ontario wilderness and to Atwood’s remarkable parents.Hilary KnightVictoria, British Columbia, Canada • Oliver Wainwright says the High Line in New York has inspired many imitators (Top 10 buildings of the century … so far, G2, 17 September).
