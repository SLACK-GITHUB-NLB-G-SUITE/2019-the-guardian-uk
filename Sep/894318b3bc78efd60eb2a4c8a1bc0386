As much as I love a crumble, I have always been squeamish about cooked apples. Although blackberries are in full season, it’s hard to pick enough from the hedgerows to make a whole crumble. Instead of mixing them with apple to bulk them out, toss them into this cake instead and top with the irresistible crumble mix. Happy blackberrying. As you would a crumble, serve with lots of thick, cold cream, preferably from a small, local dairy (check out the difference in flavour!) or with ice-cream, if you prefer. Prep 30 minCook 1 hrServes 6 120g butter, at room temperature, plus extra to grease275g light brown sugar2 free-range eggs250g plain flour1 tsp baking powder1 tsp ground cinnamon10 black peppercorns, ground10 allspice berries, ground2 tsp ground ginger½ tsp salt200g sour cream½ tsp vanilla essence300g blackberries For the crumble115g demerara sugar60g plain flour60g cold butter Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/ 350F/gas 4 and grease a 21cm cake tin. Cream the butter and sugar in a food processor, or by hand, until light and pale – about five minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in between, until mixed. In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients, then fold half into the creamed butter. Fold in the sour cream and vanilla, followed by the remaining dry mix. Pour half the batter into the baking dish, scatter with the blackberries, then pour the rest of the batter on top, making sure the blackberries are fully submerged. Next, rub together the crumble ingredients in a large bowl until they resemble large breadcrumbs. Scatter over the top of the batter and bake for 50-60 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Make drop scones at the weekend using the sour cream, blackberries and spices – they are the most delicious breakfast and take very little time. The crumble cake works well with apples or pears as well as blackberries. Blackberries are also a perfect match for game, particularly pigeon and venison.
