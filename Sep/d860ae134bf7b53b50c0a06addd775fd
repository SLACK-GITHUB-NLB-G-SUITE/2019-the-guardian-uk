The glute bridgeLie on your back with your feet on the floor, hip distance apart. Using your bum, raise your hips off the floor.

Go up on your tiptoes so only your toes and forearms touch the floor. The main muscle in use is your core; but by squeezing your bum, the glutes are also activated. Hold that plank position and aim for 30 seconds at a time. To make it easier, go on your knees, not tiptoes. Back extensionThis strengthens your lower back. Lie on your front, hands down beside you, and raise up through the chest: with your neck slightly long and chin tucked inward, squeeze the shoulder blades together. Then slowly lower yourself back down. â€¢ Chris Richardson is co-founder of zerogravitypilates.co.uk As told to Hanako Lowry
