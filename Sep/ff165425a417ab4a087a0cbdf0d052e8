News of the temporary closure of inpatient admissions at St Mary’s hospice in Cumbria should cause alarm bells to ring across health and social care (Shortage of doctors forces rural hospice to turn away dying patients, 11 September). Against a backdrop of serious long-term challenges facing hospice and palliative care providers, this is not the first, nor last, casualty of an end-of-life care system under pressure. The government urgently needs to get serious about the long-term challenges facing the health and social care system. In the UK, every five minutes someone dies without the care and support they need. This issue is compounded in Cumbria, a predominately rural area, which means many already experience a postcode lottery for care. With the numbers of people dying each year steadily rising, it is likely that continued staff shortages will mean more people at the end of their lives receiving insufficient care. This creates distressing situations that have long-term mental health impacts on families and carers. The health and social care workforce is passionate and capable, but needs the numbers to tackle increasing demand. We need a proper government-led conversation about long-term planning for the delivery of end-of-life care to address these issues. The alternative is more headlines about dying people missing out.Karen TorleyMarie Curie divisional general manager, north • Your sobering report is unfortunately matched by the closure of another hospice, the Pembridge palliative care inpatient unit in west London. The good news is that lots of local residents and others are campaigning for its valuable service to be restored.Francis PrideauxLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
