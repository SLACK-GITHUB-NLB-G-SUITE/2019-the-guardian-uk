In reviewing Jessie Burton’s latest novel, Alfred Hickling says the author supported herself in the “menial role” of PA “while quietly composing a piece of art” (Review, 21 September). A definition of menial is “(of work) not requiring much skill”. But the job of a PA is far from lacking in skill. I have been PA to policy advisers and chief executives (at board level in the Equal Opportunities Commission), a role in which I can assure you I demonstrated far greater skill and knowledge than those in jobs with much grander titles. I’ve been a PA to hospital consultants who depended on my skills to function at the highest level. I’ve done lower-ranked jobs that nevertheless required their own skill. Incidentally, we “menial” folk pay taxes and can even read – and buy books! Luckily for those skilled composers of “art” to whom we are supposed to feel eternally grateful.Debbie Cameron Formby, Merseyside • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
