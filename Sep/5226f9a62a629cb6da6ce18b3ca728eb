Climate activist Greta Thunberg seemed to troll Donald Trump on Tuesday, changing her Twitter bio to reflect the US president’s mockery of her emotional address to the United Nations on Monday. On Monday, Thunberg gave a blistering speech at the climate summit in New York, criticizing world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through a lack of action on the climate crisis. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” One contributor to the president’s favourite TV network was roundly criticised – and caused Fox News to issue an apology – after he responded to Thunberg’s speech by calling her “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. Trump was more subtle. In a tweet, he seemed to belittle the 16-year-old’s condemnation of world leaders for inaction on climate change. “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” the president wrote. “So nice to see!” On Tuesday, Thunberg chose to respond indirectly, embracing the title by adding it to her Twitter profile. It now reads: “A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.” Her profile had read: “16 year old climate activist with Asperger’s”. Thunberg has previously spoken out about her Asperger’s syndrome diagnosis after she was criticized over the condition, saying it makes her “different”, but that she considers it a “superpower”.
