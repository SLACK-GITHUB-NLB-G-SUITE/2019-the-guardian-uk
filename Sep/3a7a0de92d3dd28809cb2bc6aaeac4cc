This take on the old fashioned showcases an amazing spirit. Mezcal’s fruity, smoky notes make it a great pairing for passion fruit, which is just coming back into season, as well as other tropical fruits such as pineapple. Serves 1 50ml passion fruit syrup (see method)50ml mezcal – we use Ilegal Joven 1 strip orange zest3 drops Angostura bitters½ passion fruit, to garnish For the syrup, gently heat one part brown sugar syrup with one part passion fruit pulp, then leave to cool and infuse for a couple of hours. To make the drink, pour the mezcal and syrup into a mixing glass, add the orange zest and bitters, and stir vigorously. Pour over three large ice cubes in a short tumbler, garnish with half a passion fruit and serve with a teaspoon to eat the fruit with afterwards. Sara Sanna, Masa + Mezcal, Bristol
