New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown won’t be prosecuted on sexual assault accusations because of the statute of limitations, according to Pittsburgh-area law enforcement. Britney Taylor is bringing a civil lawsuit against Brown for an alleged incident in June 2017. “Our office, along with the Allegheny county police department, made contact with counsel for the plaintiff in the federal lawsuit involving Antonio Brown,” the Allegheny county district attorney’s office wrote in a statement. “Procedurally, it appears there is a statute of limitations issue in moving forward with any inquiry involving the Allegheny county allegation mentioned in the lawsuit.” The NFL has interviewed Taylor and continues to investigate, but it is not known whether the league will interview Brown. Taylor claims Brown sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions, including once in Pittsburgh, where the wide receiver played for the Steelers for nine seasons, and twice in Florida. ESPN also has reported that Brown, who hired Taylor as a trainer after they attended Central Michigan at the same time, turned down a $2m settlement before the suit was filed. Confidential discussions between the two parties were held, and it was determined the Patriots would not have known about the allegations unless terms of the confidentiality had been breached. Darren Heitner, Brown’s attorney, said in a statement last week that his client had been in a “consensual personal relationship” with Taylor.
