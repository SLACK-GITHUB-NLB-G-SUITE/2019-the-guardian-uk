Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. On my walk to work I have seen a houseboat for sale and I’m wondering if this is the only way I’ll get out of rented accommodation. I’d love to live near water but fear I’ll end up cramped and cold, and yearning for more privacy. What’s the reality of canal life? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
