A special debate in Iowa on Saturday will see Democratic 2020 contenders share the stage with a number of community leaders, as grassroots organizers bid to push progressive issues further into the presidential race. Candidates, also including the former Obama cabinet member Juli√°n Castro and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, will be allowed only a few minutes to speak before taking questions from community members as organizers hope to steer the event away from established stump speeches. Watch all the action from Des Moines live here.
