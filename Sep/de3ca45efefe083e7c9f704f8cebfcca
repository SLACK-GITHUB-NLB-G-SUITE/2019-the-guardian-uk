Barcelona have been fined only €300 (£265) by the Spanish football federation (RFEF) after they were found to have broken the rules in their pursuit of €120m signing Antoine Griezmann from Atlético Madrid. The France forward moved from Atlético to Barça in July after the Catalans exercised his release clause, although Atlético complained negotiations took place when Griezmann was under contract with them. The RFEF’s competition committee said in a statement on Thursday that Barça broke its rules by beginning negotiations with Griezmann while he was under contract with Atlético without their permission, but absolved the player of any responsibility. Barça and Atlético were not immediately available for comment.
