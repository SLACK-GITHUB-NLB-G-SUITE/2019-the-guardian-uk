I can assure Max Rushden (My tale of WhatsApp and existential crises in the crazy world of amateur football, 20 September) that getting a team together in the 21st century with mobile phones to hand is nothing compared with the problem in the 1950s and 1960s when call-ups were sent out by postcard in the preceding week and gaps filled on the day by knocking on players’ doors. Some things don’t change though, including sitting on someone’s shoulders to put up the goal nets.Michael LeighLondon • Charlie Whelan’s memory could do with refreshing (Letters, 24 September). Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon) was written out of Crossroads in 1981. Derek Robinson was sacked in November 1979 and his erstwhile colleagues voted overwhelmingly against striking in his support.Mark TahaLondon • “Everybody needs to be singing from the same hymn sheet,” intones Len McCluskey as the faithful gather at Brighton (Report, 23 September). In my experience, you can supply every member of the congregation with a single song-sheet, but there’s no guarantee they will get the words right, let alone sing in harmony.Fr Alec Mitchell Holyhead, Anglesey • It seems that most people having trouble using the BBC Sounds app use Apple products (Letters, 21 September). My cheap LG phone runs Android Version 6. The latest is Version 10, yet I have had no problem.Steve KileyBristol • Surely knowingly profiting from charity shop mistakes is slightly unethical (How to spot a charity shop bargain, G2, 24 September)? Especially if you resell.Stephanie WhiteLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
