There’s no reason why GPs should be alarmed over NHS plans for pharmacists to provide statins (Report, 4 September). Pharmacists are experts in the safe and effective use of medicines, which also includes reviewing and stopping medicines when appropriate. The NHS in England has placed them at the centre of its plans to prevent and reduce deaths from heart attack and stroke; advice on and provision of statins – a very safe class of medicine – is a logical extension of this. Community pharmacies offer rapid access to healthcare advice and lifestyle support, with health checks identifying high-risk patients earlier and helping them stay out of hospital. With the NHS facing a staffing crisis and with growing demand, supporting earlier detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the community has the potential to save lives, improve patient care and reduce pressure on GPs and other parts of the health service.Claire AndersonChair, English Pharmacy Board, Royal Pharmaceutical Society • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
