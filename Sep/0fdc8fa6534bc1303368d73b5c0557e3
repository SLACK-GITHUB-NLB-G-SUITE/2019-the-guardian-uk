West Ham fear that Lukasz Fabianski will be out for at least three months after a scan showed the goalkeeper sustained a torn thigh muscle against Bournemouth on Saturday. There were hopes that Fabianski had only strained the muscle after limping off during the first half of the 2-2 draw at the Vitality Stadium but further examinations have shown that West Ham are facing a lengthy spell without the Poland international. It is understood there is a chance the former Arsenal and Swansea goalkeeper could be out for even longer than three months. Fabianski has been outstanding for West Ham since his £7m move from Swansea in 2018 and has already kept three clean sheets in the Premier League this season, helping Manuel Pellegrini’s side to rise to fourth in the table. He was replaced by Roberto against Bournemouth. Roberto joined West Ham on a free transfer in the summer and the experienced Spaniard has made two appearances in the Carabao Cup this season. He had a poor game in the 4-0 defeat by League One’s Oxford United in the third round last week. West Ham also signed David Martin on a free transfer in the summer and the former Millwall goalkeeper will now challenge Roberto for Fabianski’s place. Pellegrini is already without Michail Antonio for a lengthy period after the forward sustained a serious hamstring injury against Newport County last month.
