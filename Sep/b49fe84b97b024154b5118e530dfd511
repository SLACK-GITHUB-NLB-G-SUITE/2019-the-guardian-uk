Elena Ferrante, the Italian author whose Neapolitan novels became a global phenomenon, is to publish a new book in Italy on 7 November – her first novel in four years. Ferrante’s Italian publisher, Edizioni E/O, made the announcement with a terse tweet on Monday morning. Her English-language publisher, Europa Editions, followed suit, with a short extract indicating that the story was set in Naples. Neither publisher has revealed the new novel’s title. It begins like this. #ElenaFerrante #NewNovel Translated by Ann Goldstein. pic.twitter.com/wHoNW5yBB2 Ferrante’s four-part Neapolitan series, which began with My Brilliant Friend, told the story of the lifelong friendship and rivalry between two women who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in the southern Italian city. The second season of HBO’s TV adaptation of the series, which will cover the second book of the quartet, is expected to be aired next year. Since the Neapolitan novels, Ferrante, who conceals her identity behind a pseudonym, has published one book, Incidental Inventions, a collection of columns that she wrote during her year-long collaboration with the Guardian. Ferrante’s previous books include the Turin-based The Days of Abandonment and The Troubling Love. In 2016 the investigative journalist Claudo Gatti caused a storm in the literary world after claiming to unmask Ferrante as Anita Raga, a Rome-based translator who once helped run a publishing imprint of Italian writers. Gatti was criticised for a gross violation of the writer’s privacy and some believed he would be blamed if Ferrante disappeared from public life. In interviews over the years, Ferrante suggested that her anonymity was a vital component of her work. Being unknown, she said, gave her the space and liberty to focus on her writing, free from the “anxiety of notoriety” or the temptation to censor herself.
