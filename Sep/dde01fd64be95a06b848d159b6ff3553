Dr Phillip Lee MP claims that he has been misrepresented on his 2014 amendment to the immigration bill, saying that he wanted migrants screened for HIV “so that they could be treated”, rather than so they could be kept out (Report, 17 September). The text of his 2014 amendment reads: “(1) The Secretary of State may by order provide that persons who apply for immigration permission must demonstrate that they are not carriers of any of the prescribed pathogens listed in subsection (2). “(2) The prescribed pathogens are— (a) Hepatitis B; (b) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus); (c) such other pathogens as the Secretary of State may prescribe by order under this section.” It does not mention anything about treatment. It seems that if anyone has misrepresented Dr Lee’s views, he himself has, either in 2019 or in the text of his 2014 amendment.Andrew HintonLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
