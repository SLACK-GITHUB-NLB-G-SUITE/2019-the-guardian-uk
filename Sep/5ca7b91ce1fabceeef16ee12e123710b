If the world is a footballand players nomadswhat ties us to this dream, to this history?They were, we are, a long thread of feelingfrom those muddy fields to this stadiumWe are heirs of a culture, a way of beingListen once more to the heartbeat of San MamésListen to the spirit of the fansThough we may not be the richestnor, probably, the bestour greatest victory is to be who we are The poets set off at eight and went west along Pozas, which is the only way to head. As much a portal as a street, Pozas is narrow, noisy, tight with people, a pace and direction of its own. On either side, every other entrance is a bar, flags hung over doorways; at the end, the football stadium rises in the sunset, drawing you in irresistibly but without hurry as if there’s no way out, nowhere else you could possibly go and nowhere else you would want to go either, especially not today. The Cathedral, they call it. And, as they were pulled towards San Mamés on Friday night, through red-and-white shirts, through blue-and-white shirts too, Jon, Onintza, Xabi, Andoni, Maddalen and Amets occasionally stopped and broke into verse. When they did, crowds wearing both colours gathered to listen and laugh. The Basque derby means the bertso derbi too, sport as song and song as sport. Competitive, improvised street poetry: witty, incisive and theirs. The six bertsolari, three supporting Athletic Club, three supporting Real Sociedad, had paused to perform where Pozas crosses María Díaz de Haro street and momentarily opens up, and then again on a stage set in front of the new stadium on old ground. Standing where the original San Mamés had stood for 99 years and where its spirit survives, they’d done battle, words flying. Now, just before 10pm, two minutes before kick-off, Jon Maia and Maddalen Arzallus were on the pitch. “If the world is a football …” Jon began, “our greatest victory is to be ourselves.” Outside San Mamés, before the football, there's another derby - el Bertso Derbia, which @sidlowe says is "a kind of improvised competitive Basque street poetry".Those Basques know how to have a good time...#tsfpAtTheGames #AthleticRealSociedad pic.twitter.com/0Rc2F4VXsQ When he lowered the mic, 47,697 people roared. In the tunnel, waiting, Gaizka Garitano could hear it. “This is not any game,” he said later, and if anyone knows that, he does. Growing up, he wanted to be a bertsolari, but he doubts that he really had the talent for it – these guys are the Messi and Ronaldo of verse, he says – and he became a footballer instead. Born in Bilbao, he played in the Basque Country for Athletic, la Real, Eibar and Alavés. Of his 16-year playing career, 14 were spent in Euskadi and he built a coaching career there too. He it was who took Eibar into primera for the first time ever and since December he has been manager of Athletic Club. What he has done at both is extraordinary; it is also fitting somehow, faithful to an identity which is his. There’s something special about Basque football and about this derby in particular, where the fans sit together and that was perhaps even more evident this week. Sometimes football is an expression of self, and this felt like one of those times – all the more so in the context of what has happened at Athletic over the nine months since Garitano took over, seeking survival. Like this wasn’t just winning; this was being. The Basque Country makes up 1.4% of Spain’s territory, 1.4% of its population and 20% of its top-flight football teams. Include Osasuna (which many do; the club name is Basque) and thus add Navarre (which is another step again in an uneasy debate), and it accounts for 3.6% of the territory, 6.2% of the population and a quarter of all first division teams. Most know about Athletic’s policy, but it’s not just them. In the build-up to this game, Athletic striker Iñaki Williams was asked if he envied la Real’s signings, which include Alexander Isak, Martin Odegaard, and Portu; no, he said, but they envy us having people “from home”. Yet until John Aldridge came, unwelcome at the start, celebrated at the end, la Real had a similar approach; 15 of their squad have been in the youth system; and on Friday seven started – two in the Athletic side. Of the 22 starters, 15 were Basque (17 if you include two from Navarre), 11 had been in in the junior teams at Athletic or Real and both managers were Basque. The game was Basque too, very Athletic. And if there’s an element of cliché in that, there’s also a significant element of truth. Garitano heard Jon finish, then sent his team out the way he does – roaring at their rivals, relentless. As El Diario Vasco put it: “Every time Real lost the ball, there was an ambush; every corner was a headache; every attempt to bring the ball out, they were suffocated; every challenge, a defeat.” They were behind after 11 minutes: in his 122nd consecutive game, Williams swept in Ander Capa’s ball after a neat one-two from a throw – Capa’s third assist and the third time Athletic have scored via a throw. It was two on 28, Raúl García looping a lovely shot beyond Miguel-Ángel Moyá, which is how it finished but it could have been more. Yuri Berchiche struck one, Iñigo Córdoba another as Athletic steamrollered Real, racking up 15 shots in a din enough to make ears bleed. Unable to live with it, built for a different game, la Real didn’t have their first shot until the 84th minute. La Real had prepared for this, manager Imanol Alguacil said. But they could do nothing to stop it and could find no way out. There was escaping Athletic or the truth: his team had a goal ruled out by VAR, which also turned a penalty into a free-kick just outside the box, and their captain Asier Illaramendi was taken off injured, all moments that might have changed this, but Alguacil admitted that Athletic were “better in everything”; “they deserved to win,” he said. His side looked cowed, “like lambs before lions”, Marca called them. “It’s not easy to nullify them the way we nullified them, because they’re a very, very good team,” Garitano said, “but Athletic imposed themselves – as we have done in the last few months.” That “last few months” was not pulled from thin air. Before the game, Garitano had noted how his team had begun “overwhelming opponents” and they did it again. La Real were “unrecognisable”, one headline had it; Athletic, on the other hand, were “a red and white cyclogenesis”, said El Correo, and exactly the way they always are. Or are supposed to be. If there was a moment that defined this game, that defines them, rather than Williams’s goal or García celebrating his by signalling the wound on his leg; rather than the cheeky Capa skill that got a huge cheer, Yuri bombing up and down, or Iker Munian buzzing everywhere; rather than the way defenders look over their shoulder, terrified, every time Williams sets off; maybe it was the moment la Real broke. The pitch opened before them, but suddenly, Dani García, whose mates are all Real fans, closed it again. Stepping out, alone, he won the tackle then stood there, arms wide, defiant, a gladiator in the ring. Are you not entertained? Oh, they were entertained all right, greeting him with a wall of sound. Football is this too, especially here. Afterwards, one Real Sociedad-supporting columnist called Athletic “primitive”, insisting “there is no team that obtains more with less”, whinging: “How boring!” But he was wrong. Ask those fans what they thought. Or the headline that called Athletic “a team to enjoy”. Or Garitano, who described them as “alegre” – happy, open, fun. Better still, ask them what they want. Because, if Garitano also called them intense, a team based “more on the physical than the technical”, a side that has to “sweat every point”, that is also the way they are – and the way they’re supposed to be. “It’s in our DNA, the way we are,” Athletic’s manager insisted. “You talk to me about style books, but I haven’t read any of them. This is us. It’s contagious. People at San Mamés enjoy it; we have to transmit that to them, that effort. We can have a bad game but we always have to do that. The communion with the stands is very important. Historically we have a way of playing, values, and we have to express that every day.” Highlights as @Athletic_en won the Basque derby to go 🔝 of #LaLigaSantander!

They had won only once in 13 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Twelve years later, his son Gaizka arrived at Athletic as coach. They had won just once in 14 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Athletic were 18th but within a month they scored that penalty, from that run, and didn’t lose for seven games. On the final day, they were a crossbar’s width from a European place. They’d climbed 10 places, winning 12 of 24 under Garitano and began this new season beating Barcelona, with Aritz Aduriz’s absurd overhead kick. On Friday, they went on top. Two days later, Atlético overtook them but Athletic are still second. “This is something to enjoy,” Williams said on Friday night. Athletic had gone 14 games without defeat at home – right back to the last time la Real came. Seven months on, they’d beaten them back and had done it their way; they were who they are. “I’m glad the people are happy,” Garitano said. “This is not any game; it’s special, the most important night of the entire year.” • It’s good to have you back, El Sadar. Barcelona were bad, but it shouldn’t only be about that; it should be about Osasuna too. They’re still unbeaten at home, after a deserved 2-2 draw with Barcelona, Roberto Torres getting both, the first a lovely sidefooted volley. That’s 27 games now without defeat there. “At times we bordered on perfection,” said Osasuna coach Jagoba Arrasate.

Well, this time it’s true. On the same day that Ansu Fati became Barcelona’s youngest goalscorer at 16 years 304 days – “’I said to myself, bloody hell, I’ve scored’,” he admitted afterwards – Jorge Molina became Getafe’s oldest goalscorer at 37 years and 131 days. And here’s the even more amazing bit: Molina has scored 51 first division goals, 46 of them after turning 30. • Atlético Madrid were 2-0 down, the first time they had ever let in two goals in the opening 20 minutes under Diego Simeone. They changed formation twice, brought on three subs – two of whom scored and the other was a 19-year-old debutant – and came back to beat Eibar 3-2, getting the winner in the 90th minute, sending Simeone racing into the arms of Mono Burgos. They’re the only team to have won all three games so far.

He scored two and saw two yellow cards (within seconds of each other in the 90th minute) as Madrid got a 2-2 draw at Villarreal. For the third year in a row. Mostly, they were really not that good. And it’s hard to avoid the feeling they don’t really know what to do about it, that this wasn’t what they planned – something Bale’s inclusion suggests. Santi Cazorla’s still got it, by the way. But that’s three games in a row Villarreal have led and they haven’t won any.

It was hard to disagree, too. • Deadline day, so what is Valencia manager Marcelino asking for? “I think it makes no difference what I ask for,” he said. There may be trouble ahead. • Neymar 2020.
