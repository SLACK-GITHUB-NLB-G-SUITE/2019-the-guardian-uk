Words matter, something lost on a participant or two in last week’s political fandango. We’re not debating our opponents – we’re calling them surrender monkeys or fascists. Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly apologised for equating a doctor disagreeing with him over Brexit with Andrew Wakefield’s false linking of vaccines to autism. Boris Johnson didn’t apologise for calling Jeremy Corbyn a “great big girl’s blouse”, but did at least make his “denigration via feminisation” policy cross party: David Cameron is, apparently, a “girly swot”. Things are a whole lot worse in the US, especially when it comes to the issue of race. For two centuries American politicians have sought to fashion national unity from a truly diverse population. But how does the language that leaders use affect how Americans feel about their overlapping ethnic and national identities? New US research takes on this tough question. Focusing on whites and Latinos, it reaches some challenging conclusions. The first is that politicians’ words matter – they really do change attitudes. The quickest way for politicians to tap into the national identity of white people? Rhetoric portraying ethnic and national identity as in conflict (hello Donald Trump). Depressingly, this has little effect on many Latinos, who have got used to it. But there are challenges, too, for politicians wanting to engage Latinos in national unity. Simply celebrating diversity doesn’t work – only arguing that Latino identity is compatible with American identity does. We are all from diverse backgrounds but share a sense of national attachment, yet even well-intentioned politics needs to recognise that different groups respond differently to the same rhetoric. So choose your words carefully. • Read more from Torsten Bell’s Top of the Charts at resolutionfoundation.org
