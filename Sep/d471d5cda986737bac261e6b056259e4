Georgia bounced back from their opening World Cup defeat to Wales with a comfortable 33-7 bonus-point Pool D victory over Uruguay. Georgia’s superior strength was too much for their South American opponents to handle and they ran in five tries at Kumagaya Rugby Stadium. To make matters worse for Uruguay, replacement Facundo Gattas was sent off late on for a high tackle. It took just eight minutes for Georgia to hit the scoreboard. Wing Alexander Todua broke through the Uruguayan defence and received a penalty after coming up just short of the try-line. From the resulting scrum, Georgia spun the ball wide and Todua had an easy run in. Number eight Otari Giorgadze then picked up from the base of another dominant Georgia scrum five metres out and there was no stopping him crashing over. Uruguay hit back almost immediately from a lineout. Wing Rodrigo Silva burst through a series of Georgian tackles and laid the ball off to inside centre Andres Vilaseca for an easy run under the posts. Georgia needed just two minutes of the second-half to extend their advantage and it was no surprise that it again came from their dominance at the set-piece, Levan Chilachava this time burrowing over from a five-metre scrum. Jaba Bregvadze secured the bonus point when he touched down from a rolling maul after 51 minutes and moments later Giorgi Kveseladze pounced on a loose ball to add the fifth try after Silva lost possession close to his own try line. Uruguay were reduced to 14 men three minutes from the end when Gattas left English referee Wayne Barnes with little option but to dismiss the replacement after a no-arms tackle, the Uruguayan’s shoulder making contact with the head of Georgia flanker Shalva Sutiashvili.
