The sound of ruffled feathers in reaction to your top 50 list of plays of the 21st century (G2, 18 September) is almost deafening. The absence of David Hare or Howard Brenton may have caused a stir, but is there no room for Harold Pinter? Surely his final play, Celebration, premiered in 2000, merits a top 50 place if not a top 20. I’m biased because I was in it, but didn’t its visceral dissection of the naked greed of late-Thatcher/Blairism presage the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the cataclysm that followed?Andy de la TourLondon • In the mid-1950s, my engineering student boyfriend always signed off with the symbols for the Greek letter lambda (lower case) raised to the power of infinity: love always (Letters, 20 September). We continued this throughout our married life and it is now inscribed on his tombstone: his name, the symbols below, with space for my name below again when the time comes. The undertaker was rather bemused and I sometimes wonder what strollers through the churchyard make of this.Valerie LewisWantage, Oxfordshire • You say a diver served in the Royal Navy as “a warfare specialist” (Wreck of battleship and Lundy cliff steps given protection, 20 September). I thought that all members of the Royal Navy were warfare specialists?Peter HepworthLeigh on Sea, Essex • Anne Cowper (Letters, 20 September) thinks readers in Wales, Scotland and Ireland will be surprised that there is only one home side in the Rugby World Cup. I hope not; the home side Ben Ryan was referring to is Japan.Dominic MeredithBristol • Is the current supreme court battle Pannick v Johnson the Incredible Silk v the Incredible Sulk?
