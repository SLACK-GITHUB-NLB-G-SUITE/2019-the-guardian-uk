Pep Guardiola could only put his hands up after Norwich pulled off the shock of the season so far to leave Manchester City five points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. Despite a late rally City were unable to claw anything out of a game Norwich had led from the 19th minute. Guardiola refused to criticise his players after the match, however, and warned his rivals that the title is a long way from over. “Big congratulations for Norwich on how well they have done,” Guardiola said. “We didn’t concede too much in terms of chances, Bournemouth had more chances against us. But in the end we weren’t strong enough in either box. We learn from that. “We knew the quality of Norwich because they destroyed the Championship last season. They have the confidence to play. In some moments we didn’t play quite well. We had chances to equalise in the game but in the end congratulations to them.” Norwich’s third goal came about after Emi Buendía caught Nicolás Otamendi in possession on the edge of the Manchester City box. Guardiola refused to criticise the player, though he was clear that a mistake had been made. “Nico doesn’t really know someone is coming and nobody tells him”, Guardiola said in defence of his player. “Sometimes you know we make mistakes. I think sometimes we forget these guys are human. Football is quick, things can go wrong and I must see what I can do to help them. “Five points [behind Liverpool] is five points but we are in September. What are we supposed to do? Say: ‘It’s September and congratulations to Liverpool you are champions’? Not for one second am I going to doubt my players.”
