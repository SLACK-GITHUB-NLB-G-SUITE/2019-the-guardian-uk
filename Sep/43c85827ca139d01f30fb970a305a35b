Israelis have voted in a second election that has left the country in a political stalemate. In the coming days, the president will consult party leaders before choosing the person he believes has the best chance of putting together a coalition. There are several possible scenarios. Here are five popular theories: Political foes Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz could join forces to make a unity government. Gantz, however, has said he will not sit in a government with Netanyahu due to the corruption allegations. Also, it is not clear who would be prime minister. This is the dream scenario for Gantz, whereby the ruling Likud party sacrifices Netanyahu and joins the retired military general in government under a new leader. The Joint List alliance of Arab parties looks likely to be the third-largest bloc in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. They abhor Gantz’s nationalist politics but could back him as a strategy to topple Netanyahu, who ran an especially anti-Arab campaign. Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, has made it out of a lot of tight corners. He may still scrape together a majority with some sort of deal to lure smaller parties. Neither party is able to forge a majority coalition government, and in several weeks, a third election is called. Everything is reset for a January poll that could be just as inconclusive.
