Sevilla have signed Javier Hernández from West Ham for £7.3m. The striker has been deemed surplus to requirements at the London Stadium after the arrivals of Sébastien Haller and Albian Ajeti. Hernández joined West Ham two summers ago from Bayer Leverkusen for £16m and scored 17 goals, the most recent in the draw with Brighton in the second game of this season. The 31-year-old has not played since, with Haller and Andriy Yarmolenko emerging Manuel Pellegrini’s preferred strike partnership. Both scored in Saturday’s 2-0 win at home to Norwich. Matteo Darmian has completed his move from Manchester United to Parma for €1.5m (£1.4m). “Everyone at Manchester United would like to thank Matteo for his service and wish him all the best for the future,” the club said in a statement. The defender, who had a year on his contract, joined in 2015.
