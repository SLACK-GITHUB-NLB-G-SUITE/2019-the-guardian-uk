MK Dons got the better of rivals AFC Wimbledon thanks to goals from Sam Nombe and Rhys Healey. Marcus Forss pulled one back for the visitors but MK Dons held on to secure all three points against the phoenix club. Nombe opened the scoring when his low drive from the edge of the area bounced off both posts before crossing the goal-line. The lead was doubled by Healey when he created space 18 yards from goal where he directed the ball into the back of the net. AFC Wimbledon were given hope when substitute Forss scored with seven minutes left to play on his debut after joining from Brentford on loan. The result took MK Dons into mid-table while the visitors are still winless in League One this season after seven matches, which leaves them in the relegation zone. Doncaster came back from a goal down to beat Rotherham in the other early kick-off. Debutant Jake Hastie put the Millers into the lead when his free-kick defeated everyone in the box and nestled into the corner. Veteran James Coppinger levelled matters after the break and Ben Whiteman kept his cool when he converted a penalty with just two minutes left on the clock.
