How does Sunday start? With confusion and a bad neck at 3am. I fall asleep on the sofa in front of Match of The Day on Saturdays. Usually I find my daughter in my bed anyway, so if I can be bothered I tiptoe upstairs and get into hers. What’s for breakfast? I eat porridge all week, but Sundays are for something more exciting. I make a mean fry-up – to be honest that’s pretty much all I can cook. Sometimes I make boiled eggs, harking back to my childhood, even cutting toast into soldiers. It’s 4.5 minutes for the perfect yolk. Where do you go for fresh air? My son and I discovered Parkland Walk with the Beavers, a gem of a trail from Highgate to Finsbury Park in north London. A Sunday smell? I used to be the captain of Loughton Boys FC, so it’s still a concoction of Deep Heat and fresh cut grass. And a sound? Andrew Marr. I’ve become a lot more politicised because of Brexit. I’m addicted to his show. Perfect Sunday lunch? I’m a regular at Sumak, the wonderful Greek restaurant in Crouch End. The food is delicious, everyone is welcoming – and it’s great value for money. Do you work? If I have to, although I don’t like to. Sundays are a day for recuperation and family. It’s been such a busy few years, sometimes I have no choice. I’m always at the beck and call of a filming schedule. An afternoon out? To see the family in Essex or a trip to Portobello Road market. My teenage son is an avid collector, he takes after his late grandmother. We potter around stalls and antique shops and then hit the pub. How does Sunday end? With Match of The Day 2 and me sprawled on the sofa. I’ll probably fall asleep there, again, and play another game of bedroom lottery. Daniel Mays stars in Temple now available on Sky One
