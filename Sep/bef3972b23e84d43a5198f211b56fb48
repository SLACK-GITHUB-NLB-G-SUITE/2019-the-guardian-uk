Roma have agreed a deal to sign Henrikh Mkhitaryan on loan from Arsenal with an option to buy the attacking midfielder. Mkhitaryan arrived in the Italian capital on Monday to conclude the deal in final hours of the European transfer window. The 30-year-old signed for Arsenal in January 2018 from Manchester United in a swap involving Alexis Sánchez. Eighteen months later both players have left their clubs for loan moves to Serie A, Sánchez having joined Internazionale last week. Mkhitaryan came on during Arsenal’s draw with Tottenham on Sunday but has not started since the opening day. He is the third experienced player moved on by Unai Emery in the final days of the window, following Nacho Monreal and Mohamed Elneny, who have joined Real Sociedad and Besiktas respectively.
