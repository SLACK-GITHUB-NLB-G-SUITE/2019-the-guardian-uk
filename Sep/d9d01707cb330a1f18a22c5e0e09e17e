Fleabag writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her on-screen love interest Andrew Scott, also known as “hot priest”, handed out cans of gin and tonic to fans queueing for tickets to the stage show on Saturday. The two characters bonded over cans of the alcoholic drink in the second series of the comedy-drama after the clergyman confessed to having some of them stored in his sacristy, and as people lined up outside the box office hoping to secure tickets for the sold-out theatre adaptation, they were surprised by the two actors giving away the beverages.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge thanked everyone for waiting for hours and said that she hoped people would get tickets and would enjoy the show. She added: “Andrew was carrying slimline G&T, whilst PWB [Waller-Bridge] had the ‘full-fat one’, as she said. It was a huge surprise to everyone and was very nice of them. Everyone was in shock.” Sales of the drink rose by 24% following its TV appearance, according to Marks and Spencer. The retailer posted photos from the scene on their Instagram page, with the caption: “This is not just any G&T … This is a G&T handed out to fans by ‘hot priest’ Andrew Scott and Phoebe Waller-Bridge!”
