A referee is recovering from non-life threatening injuries after he was hit in the face by a cannon blast while officiating a football game at Maine Maritime Academy on Saturday, according to Hancock County sheriff’s office. The sheriff said it’s a tradition of to set off a cannon using a blank shotgun shell whenever the team scores, but that an alumnus brought his own cannon to Saturday’s homecoming game and filled it with black powder. Video footage shows the referee walking behind the end zone during the second half, then grabbing his head and collapsing after the cannon goes off. A school spokesperson said the cannon “was fired from outside the fence behind the end zone”. “One of the game officials was proceeding along the end line when the cannon was fired and was struck by packing material from the cannon,” the spokesperson said. “The academy’s president has directed that these devices will no longer be permitted on campus for future events.” The referee was taken to a hospital and an investigation into the incident will be referred to the district attorney’s office pending potential criminal charges, the sheriff’s office said. The Mariners, who play in Division III, lost the game to Massachusetts Maritime Academy, 42-21.
