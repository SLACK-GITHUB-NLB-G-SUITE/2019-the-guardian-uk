One of the perils of gardening on a roof terrace is the need to keep plants in pots. Plus, the increased probability you’ll be reliant on compost bought in bags. This planting comes with a higher level of failure than growing in a flower border or vegetable bed. We often turn to dahlias to see our pots through the autumn, but August was a disaster. The Bishops (Llandaff, York and Auckland) succumbed to mildew. I don’t know if it was us, the weather or the garden centre. We water early or late in the day, wetting the soil not the plant. To be fair, it’s happened a bit before – dahlias can be prone – but nothing on this scale. At first we removed infected leaves, but too soon there were none left. Dahlias reduced to stem skeletons. We lost the battle. And now they are gone. Too soon for winter planting, we went in search of daisies. We chose echinacea in three colours: pale lipstick pink, a richer orange-red and a lemony yellow. We topped up other pots with a cheery rudbeckia and a helenium (sneezeweed). A few exhausted hanging geraniums and lobelia were replaced with overwintering viola (two-tone and single colour). A couple of weeks later, it is almost as though the trauma never happened. All the daisies are healthy and happy. They make us smile most mornings. The blue geranium has had a burst of late flowering, the crimson Bengal, too, albeit with a smaller bloom. The hanging spiders have webbed spaces between the taller plants, patiently waiting for passers-by. The Magnolia stellata leaves have turned and are starting to fall from the tree. The sycamore helicopter seed will soon blow in from the priory across the road. All returned to autumn normality while daisies brighten our darker days.
