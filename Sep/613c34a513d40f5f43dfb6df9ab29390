I am a man in my mid-50s. Despite several earlier relationships, I was resigned to spending the rest of my life alone until I met my girlfriend, an intelligent and beautiful woman in her mid-30s. We are like chalk and cheese – she is a Christian from a conservative background and I am an atheist of anarchist leanings – but this has not stopped us from having a wonderful time together. I have just received a job offer that would be perfect – being paid well to travel and do work that I enjoy immensely – except that I would have to be away for six months at a time. Do I take it or stay for what could be my last chance of happiness? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
