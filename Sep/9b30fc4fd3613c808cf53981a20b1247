Juventus Women’s hopes of progressing in the Women’s Champions League are hanging by a thread after they slipped to a 2-0 home defeat against last year’s runners-up, Barcelona. The Italian champions are aiming to make it through the last-32 stage for the first time after losing to the Danish side Brondby last year but fell behind six minutes before half-time when Alexia Putellas found the net. The former England striker Eni Aluko was introduced off the bench in the second-half but could not find a way through Barcelona’s defence. Instead Marta Torrejón added a second for Barcelona 20 minutes from time.

Elsewhere the Scottish champions, Glasgow City, secured an impressive 1-0 away victory over Chertanovo Moscow thanks to Hayley Lauder’s early goal but Hibernian lost 4-1 at home to Slavia Prague. The reigning champions, Lyon, who beat Barcelona in last season’s final to win a fourth successive European crown, coasted to a 9-0 away win over Ryazan-VDV, with Ada Hegerberg getting a hat-trick.
