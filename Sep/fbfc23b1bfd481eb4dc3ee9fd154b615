A fruity, seasonal cocktail from the list at our restaurant, Southside Scran, in Edinburgh. The nutty, herbal notes of Frangelico work very well with apple and pear. Serves 1 35ml gin (we use Tanqueray)20ml fresh lime juice15ml sugar syrup25ml pear puree (homemade or bought in)15ml Frangelico15ml apple juice 1 pear fan garnish and a sprinkling of ground cinnamon, to finish Put a big handful of ice in a shaker, add all the liquids and shake hard for 10 seconds. Double strain into a chilled cocktail glass – a Nick & Nora or coupe would be ideal – garnish with a pear fan and a sprinkle of cinnamon, and serve. • Fraser McFadden, group bar manager, The Kitchin Group, Edinburgh
