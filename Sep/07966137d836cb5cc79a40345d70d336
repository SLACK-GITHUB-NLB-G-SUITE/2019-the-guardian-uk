Finally, a senior Labour member has explained the party’s position on Brexit. After a lot of pushing by Fiona Bruce on last Thursday’s Question Time (The three questions that will decide the next election, 7 September), Emily Thornberry said Labour’s position is as follows. When Labour wins the general election they will go to Brussels and negotiate a better deal than the one currently on the table. When that negotiation is completed they will come back to Westminster and campaign against that deal. They then hope to hold another referendum, giving a choice of the deal they negotiated or remain. The outcome they would like is remain. Now I know why Jeremy Corbyn has had nothing coherent to say on the matter in years.Jerry HodgkinsonEaling, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
