Former Germany defender Christoph Metzelder has stepped down as president from his boyhood club TuS Haltern am See after he was questioned by police as part of an investigation into distribution of child abuse images, the club said in a statement. Computer equipment was confiscated during two searches, Hamburg’s state prosecutor’s office said. “The accused is alleged to have sent to a (female) recipient in Hamburg pictures with content [of child abuse images] through the communication platform WhatsApp,” Hamburg state prosecutor’s office said. Metzelder could not be reached for comment but his club, who play in the fourth division, said in a statement: “Until everything is cleared up with the ongoing investigation the former international will leave all his posts at TuS Haltern am See.” Metzelder, a Bundesliga champion with Borussia Dortmund, also played for Schalke 04 and Real Madrid. He was a World Cup runner-up in 2002 and won 47 caps for his country. He also played in the 2006 World Cup. He had been chairman at Haltern since 2014.
