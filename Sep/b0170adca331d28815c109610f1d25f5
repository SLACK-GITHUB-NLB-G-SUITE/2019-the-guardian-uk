Police in Catalonia seized a haul of marijuana after helicopter footage of the Vuelta a España revealed rooftop plantations of the drug being grown in the town of Igualada. Police were reported to have confiscated some 40 marijuana plants that could be clearly seen from broadcast footage as stage eight reached its conclusion. No arrests were made and investigations are continuing. The Guardia Civil posted the revealing aerial shots on social media. 🔴 🚁 El helicóptero de #LaVuelta19 descubre una plantación de marihuana en una azotea. pic.twitter.com/Zhry3x1rng Growing marijuana in Spain remains illegal despite consumption of the drug being decriminalised.
