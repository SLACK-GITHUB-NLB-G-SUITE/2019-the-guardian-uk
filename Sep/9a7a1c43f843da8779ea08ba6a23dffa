In 2016, Guardian photographer David Levene and architecture critic Oliver Wainwright visited Yangon to document its changing face, amid huge political upheaval and a flood of foreign investment. Its crumbling British colonial architecture, and street life in particular, provided a rich source of stories and images. Here, a young man sells fruit at a roadside stall beneath a rudimentary striplight (Wainwright is pictured just beyond him, wearing a blue T-shirt). “There was a specific time at the end of the day, when daylight was failing and the streetlights came on, when everything seemed to glow,” says Levene.
