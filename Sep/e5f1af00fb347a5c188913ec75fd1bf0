Authorities say five people were shot and wounded at a swingers club near Kansas City. Sheriff Darryl Forte of Jackson county said in a tweet that deputies responded around 3.30am on Sunday to the shooting at The Spott Lifestyle and Swingers Club. It is located in an unincorporated area less than 10 miles (16.09km) east of downtown Kansas City. Five victims were taken to hospitals in private vehicles, two with graze wounds and the others with injuries that were not classified as life-threatening. Forte said it was possible there were other victims who did not want to come forward. Forte said the department was “at a standstill” because none of the five wanted to cooperate. The sheriff said deputies found more than 40 shell casings that were fired from multiple weapons. Forte said the motive is unknown. No suspect information was released. The investigation continues and no one has been arrested.
