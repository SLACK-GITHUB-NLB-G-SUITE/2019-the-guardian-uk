I am a lady in my 80s and have been without my BT landline for four weeks because of a fault. It was reported in early August, and an engineer came out promptly to say the fault was by a road and would need traffic lights to assess and repair. There was no communication for a week, so I complained again and another engineer came and told me the same thing. On 23 August, with no progress, I demanded to speak to a manager. When I told him I had received a bill for my line rental, he said it would be waived, but it has been taken out of my account by direct debit. He transferred calls to my mobile, but it is pay-as-you-go, so is very expensive, and it has variable reception. I received an email to say the fault would be repaired by 29 August. But on the evening of 28 August BT apologised, saying it would take another five working days. It said it was doing all it could, but it was all up to Openreach (part of BT). This has caused me much distress.SS, Maidstone, Kent The way you were treated was clearly unacceptable. As soon as we reported your case to BT, all the delays seemed to stop. The next morning, an Openreach engineer arrived and managed to find his way around the problem without the need for traffic lights. BT says: “We’re really sorry for the delay. Engineers have now fixed the fault, and the service is fully restored. SS will be compensated in line with Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme, and we have also offered a goodwill gesture to cover the mobile calls.” You are pleased it has been resolved.
