Swedish authorities say a man has been denied a personalised number plate with the letters TRUMP because it would violate motor vehicle department rules, calling the letter combination “offensive”. The Aftonbladet tabloid, one of Sweden’s largest newspapers, reported that the man had said he “was drunk and thought it would be fun to apply” online for a new licence plate with the US president’s last name “because the car is American”. The Swedish Transport Agency confirmed its ruling to the Associated Press on Monday, saying it did not approve letter combinations referring to politics. It informed Marcus Saaf, who made the request, that its ruling could not be appealed.
