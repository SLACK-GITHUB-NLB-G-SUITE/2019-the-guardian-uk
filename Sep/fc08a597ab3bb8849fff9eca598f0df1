Police in Argentina have arrested members of a gang of drug dealers accused of smuggling cocaine hidden inside plastic penises. The cocaine-loaded members, of the kind found as costume adornments at party shops, were sold by dealers operating in the red light district of the city of La Plata, about 36 miles south of Argentina’s capital city of Buenos Aires. A video showing 10 of the phallic containers was released by police following a bust on the home of a Peruvian couple alleged to have led the organization. Police say they seized more than a kilo of cocaine, half a kilo of marijuana and the cocaine-loaded penises at the home of the couple, who managed a Peruvian restaurant called Little Corner of Peruvian Flavor (Rinconcito de sabor peruano). The gang’s alleged leader was already serving time under house arrest at the moment of the raid. According to investigators, hours of telephone intercepts revealed that the gang and its clients used special codes for their phone transactions: a “grandmother” represented 10 grammes of cocaine, while a “baby” was five grams.“Send three grandmothers to my house,” one client was overheard saying,according to the police.“Three grandmothers and two babies?” replied the dealer. Police led seven raids in the districts of La Plata, Berisso and San Isidro,in which five men and three women were arrested.The investigation into the gang began in January and included undercoveragents, 400 hours of taped phone calls.
