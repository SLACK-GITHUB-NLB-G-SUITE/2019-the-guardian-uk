Primoz Roglic took a step closer to winning the Vuelta a España with a strong second-place finish on the 18th stage, increasing his overall lead entering the final stretch of the three-week race. Colombian Sergio Higuita won the 177.5km (110.3-mile) stage after breaking away and fending off a late charge by Roglic and Alejandro Valverde. It was the first Grand Tour stage win for the 22-year-old rider from team EF Education First. Roglic, a former ski jumper from Slovenia riding for Jumbo-Visma, increased his lead to 2min 50sec going into the final two competitive stages before the finale in Madrid on Sunday. “I didn’t have any energy left, but I had my heart set on those dreams I’ve chased for so long,” Higuita said. “I was very emotional at the finish line because there were so many Colombian fans there.” “It was another hard day and the team was super strong again,” Roglic said. “We need to continue our good job. Every day is important, we learned our lesson yesterday and I expect ‘full gas’ racing every day.” Valverde, the veteran Spaniard from Movistar, moved back up to second overall after being edged into a third-place finish on the line by Roglic. Nairo Quintana, Valverde’s teammate, had been 2min 24sec behind Roglic after Wednesday’s stage, but ended up losing ground and dropped to third overall.

Fellow Colombian Miguel Ángel López made several attacks on Thursday but couldn’t keep up with Roglic. He lies fourth overall, more than four minutes off the lead. Realistically, it appears to be down to Movistar’s duo of Valverde and Quintana to deny Roglic his first Grand Tour victory. “There are two hard days left,” the 39-year-old Valverde said. “We can still win it or lose it.”
