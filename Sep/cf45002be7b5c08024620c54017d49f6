Restorative and relaxing spas, baths, hammams and saunas spring up throughout Europe, from Bath to Budapest, Stockholm to Sarajevo, and can be great places to soak up the atmosphere of a town or city. Some offer massages and other treatments, perhaps imported from the far east or more locally derived. They might be in wonderful old buildings reminiscent of Roman or traditional Turkish baths. Whether you’ve sweltered in the steam of a traditional public sauna or relaxed in an indoor pool fed by geothermal waters we’d like to hear about it, as long as it is available to everyone – we’re not looking for swanky hotel spas that are open only to guests. Please include details of prices where applicable, and exact locations with any relevant websites. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words.
