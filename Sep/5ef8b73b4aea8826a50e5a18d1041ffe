Wil Lutz made a 58-yard field goal as time expired to lift the New Orleans Saints to a 30-28 victory over the Houston Texans on Monday night in a game that had three scoring plays in the final minute. 58 YARDS.ICE IN HIS VEINS. WIL. LUTZ. pic.twitter.com/3za5pOsr2W Deshaun Watson threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to former Saints receiver Kenny Stills with 37 seconds left, capping a two-play, 75-yard drive that put the Texans in front after they began their final possession down by six with 50 seconds left. But there was just enough time remaining for Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who capped a 370-yard, two-touchdown performance by completing a 15-yard pass to Tedd Ginn Jr, an 11-yarder to Michael Thomas and another pass to Ginn for nine yards in quick succession. That allowed New Orleans to save its final timeout until just two seconds remained and set up Lutzâ€™s game-winning boot.
