Lando Norris has admitted that the death of Anthoine Hubert last week had an impact that still affects the McLaren driver and his family. Norris also conceded that even his confidence in reassuring his mother and father as to his safety had been shaken. Hubert was killed in a high-speed accident during an F2 race on 31 August. Soon afterwards Norris, who is only 19 and in his rookie season in F1, said the incident had left him shaken. As he prepared for the Italian Grand Prix this weekend, he revealed how hard it had hit him and particularly his father, Adam, who attends every race. “He said he felt very sick, had to go to toilet, be a bit sick,” the British driver said of his father. “He can’t even watch the TV on a normal race. He has to go somewhere and hide because he just doesn’t want to see ... So an even worse situation like it was, he can’t take it. My mum just worries because she always worries. So it impacted me and my mum and dad.” The FIA has launched an investigation into the accident and questions addressing the dangers of racing were once again raised in the paddock at Monza. Hubert’s death has brought home the stark reality that racing remains inherently dangerous despite huge safety advances and Norris admitted it had truly hit home. When asked if he still told his father not to worry, he admitted he did but did so now with qualifications. “I think that’s what you’ve got to say but it almost makes it worse for me saying that,” he said. “Because it’s what I want to say and then we have what happened last weekend. It shows it can still happen. I still want to say that but obviously still a bit more nervous to say it now.”
