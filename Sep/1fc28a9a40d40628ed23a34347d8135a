Thomas Cook has ceased trading after talks failed to save the travel company, placing 9,000 British jobs at risk and triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas. The Guardian understands that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the repatriation – codenamed Operation Matterhorn, for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean. The foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that the government would ensure no one would be left stranded overseas. We’d like to hear from people who are currently abroad and have travelled with Thomas Cook. We’re also interested in hearing from workers at the tour company.
