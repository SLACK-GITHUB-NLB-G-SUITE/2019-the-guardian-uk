A few weeks ago I discovered my Spotify account had been hacked. The breach happened a while ago, but I realised only when I found my playlists – meticulous track listings crystallised over many years and holding many memories – had been erased. This was too cruel to be a friend using my account, my first thought when I noticed the unfamiliar music. It turns out my account was being used by someone else. This user’s name was (apparently) “Juan de Juanes”, and he lived in Spain. Juan de Juanes! As trolling hacker names go, an ersatz Spanish version of Joe Bloggs is surely up there. I contacted Spotify and the situation was remedied. All trace of Juanes – his Spanish songs I didn’t understand, intriguing track names full of upside down exclamation marks – were gone. The thing is, before I realised the changes were malicious, I was delighted. Juanes’ choices skewed the algorithms that auto-generate music I might like, and so sometimes it was his selection I heard. This was stuff I might never otherwise hear; it was new and thrilling. When it was gone, I felt I had lost something. I shudder when I think how much I use these algorithms. “Recommended”, “personalised”, “tailored” reads every tech product. Increasingly these things make my world, but it’s a world whose scope has been predetermined and limited. Occasionally my mother complains I won’t watch TV with her. “TV’s rubbish,” I reply. “Endless flicking through crap, and if we find something we like, we’ve missed half of it anyway.” But then I remember my teen years, and the late-night foreign films I’d stumble on; or a few years ago, watching a surprisingly compelling caterpillar documentary in a hospital waiting room. Chance has often delivered my greatest pleasures, and I refuse to exile the random.
