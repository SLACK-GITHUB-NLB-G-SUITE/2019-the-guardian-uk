I took a short break in the countryside last month. It was one of those last-minute Airbnb weekends that are a whirlwind of booking, packing and wondering if you left the tap and hob on: could the flat both flood and burn down? It’s only as the car passes over the threshold of suburb and countryside that every cell of your body breathes a sigh of relief and you realise how much you needed a break. On our many walks through lush woodland, we saw trees weighted with little green cobnuts, the inspiration for today’s cake: an English countryside version of the Galician classic tarta de Santiago. Cobnuts seem to be a staple of farmers’ markets rather than shops, and only southern English ones at that. If you’re struggling to find them, use hazelnuts instead. Prep 15 minCook 30 minServes 10 Butter, for greasing150g blanched cobnuts or hazelnuts3 large eggs150g caster sugar50g dark chocolate Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6, then grease the bottom and sides of a 24cm round tart tin. Using a food processor or blender, blitz the nuts to a powder. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar for a few minutes, until pale and airy. Stir through the nuts to give a thick batter, smooth half the batter into the tin, crumble over the chocolate, then pour the rest of the batter on top. Bake for 30 minutes, or until risen and firm to the touch.
