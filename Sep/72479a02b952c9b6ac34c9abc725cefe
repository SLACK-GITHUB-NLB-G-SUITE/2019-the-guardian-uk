Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My partner is fed up with bikes cluttering the hall of our home. We’re thinking about putting bike storage in our front garden, but we’re worried about the risk of theft. What would readers recommend that isn’t too pricey but will keep the bikes secure? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
