Leeds blew the chance to go top of the division and instead ended the day in fourth after they suffered their first away defeat of the season in losing 1-0 to Charlton. An unwitting Macauley Bonne scored the first-half winner when the ball bounced off him after Kiko Casilla had deflected Tom Lockyer’s shot into the Zimbabwe international. Marcelo Bielsa made two half-time substitutions but his rejigging of personnel and tactics could not find an equaliser. West Brom stayed top having won 2-0 at QPR in the earlier match, after Swansea drew 1-1 with Reading after being denied three points by Andy Yiadom equalised in the last minute. Borja Bastón had given Swansea a third-minute lead they could not hold on to. Derby’s week ended with a first win of the season since the opening day, with Jamie Paterson’s 74th-minute breakaway goal the winner in a 3-2 defeat of Birmingham. Neither Mason Bennett nor Tom Lawrence were named in Philip Cocu’s squad, having been charged this week with drink-driving for the crash that has ruled out club captain Richard Keogh with a serious knee injury. Derby were 2-0 up after goals from Chris Martin and Martyn Waghorn but goals in quick succession from Gary Gardner and Ivan Sunjic levelled matters. Lukas Jutkiewicz had chance to put the Blues into the lead but his penalty was saved by Kelle Roos. Preston might have ended the day in an automatic promotion slot but drew 3-3 with Bristol City, having had to fight back from 2-0 and 3-2 down. Patrick Bauer’s header with 20 minutes to play set up a grandstand finish but neither side could find a winner. Preston are fifth, City eighth. Sheffield Wednesday are a place out of the play-offs after a rousing 4-1 win at struggling Middlesbrough. The Owls scored in the fifth and sixth minutes through Adam Clayton’s own-goal and Dominic Iorfa’s header before Paddy McNair briefly brought Boro into the game with a 19th-minute header. Adam Reach ended that resistance within four minutes before Steven Fletcher completed the rout in the 34th minute. Second-bottom Huddersfield are still searching for a first win of the season but did end a seven-game losing streak in drawing 1-1 with Millwall. Fraizer Campbell put the Yorkshire club into the lead before Matt Smith’s equaliser. Despite Shane Ferguson being red-carded with ten minutes to play, Huddersfield could not find a winner. Luton climbed to 16th after defender Matty Pearson scored the winning goal in a 2-1 defeat of former club Blackburn and are a place behind Hull, who drew 2-2 with Cardiff in a game where Danny Ward scored in injury time to level Jordy de Wijs’s header, which had come in the 89th minute.

A mistake from Tranmere goalkeeper Scott Davies gifted Ipswich back the lead when Kayden Jackson scored from close range before goals from Jon Nolan and Kane Vincent-Young ended the contest. The pressure was lifted on Sunderland manager Jack Ross by a 2-1 defeat of MK Dons after Max Power opened the scoring with a tremendous first-time finish in the 24th minute. Luke O’Nien doubled the lead before George Williams set nerves jangling in the 55th minute. Another manager under pressure, Portsmouth’s Kenny Jackett, could feel relief after his team’s 1-0 defeat of bottom club Bolton, with Brett Pitman grabbing the winner after Pompey’s players had been booed from the field at half-time. AFC Wimbledon remain second-bottom after losing 3-2 at Peterborough, the visitors’ first match since Wimbledon manager Wally Downes was suspended by the club after an FA charge for betting breaches. Oxford United followed up their midweek humbling of West Ham with a 3-0 defeat of Gillingham while Wycombe stayed in the top two with their 3-0 win at Rochdale.

Crewe and Cheltenham, in second and third, blew the chance to clamber above Exeter when they were only able to draw 1-1. Crewe had to play out the last 20 minutes with 10 men after Perry Ng received his second yellow card. Forest Green, in fourth, are level on points with Cheltenham after putting Salford to the sword with a 4-0 away win that included a Matty Stevens double. Swindon are back in fifth after losing 2-0 at Newport, who moved into sixth.
