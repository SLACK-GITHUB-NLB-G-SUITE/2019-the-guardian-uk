In a move designed to boost interest in the third Jurassic World film, producers have announced that Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill – stars of the original Jurassic Park blockbuster – will appear in the new instalment. According to Deadline, the three actors will reprise their roles from the Steven Spielberg-directed dinosaur film, released in 1993 to record box office. Goldblum played mathematician Ian Malcolm, utterer of the celebrated line “Life finds a way”, while Dern and Neill played paleontologists Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant. The Jurassic World spin-off series began in 2015, after the disappointing commercial performance of The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III, and proved a substantial box-office success, taking $1.7bn worldwide for Jurassic World and $1.3bn for its 2018 follow-up, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Currently known as Jurassic World 3, the new film will be directed by Colin Trevorrow (returning to the series after stepping aside for JA Bayona for Fallen Kingdom), and stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. It is due to start shooting next year, with a planned release date of 11 June 2021. Interest in the film has also been stoked by the release of an eight-minute Jurassic World spin-off short film, titled Battle at Big Rock, directed by Trevorrow.
