Women are taking the brunt of job losses as a result of shop closures and the rise of automated retail, according to a study on the economic consequences of the high street’s decline. In the last seven years, 75,000 sales assistant or checkout operator jobs have been lost. The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce found that while men lost 33,000 of those jobs, these were offset by the rise in roles in warehouses and as delivery drivers. As online retail and automated checkouts continue to takeover, entry-level shop floor jobs for young women and part-time work for older women juggling care commitments are disappearing. We’d like to hear from women and teenage girls in retail who have either lost their job or had their hours and pay reduced as a result of store cutbacks. Are you a woman who recently lost your job because the store you worked at closed? Have you had your hours and pay reduced as a result of cutbacks? What affect has this had on your life?
