Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I have a friend who is streaming the Ashes for free online, and another who says they get cheap Netflix by pretending to subscribe in Turkey. I presume this is all completely illegal. But are there legal ways to use virtual private networks to stream stuff at lower cost, or free? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions tomoney@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
