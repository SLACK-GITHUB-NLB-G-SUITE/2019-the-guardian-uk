I am a big advocate of thank-you notes, as people will always think better of you for saying thank you properly. We can all send a WhatsApp message, but it is not the same as sitting down, putting pen to paper, getting a first-class stamp and sending it off in the post. That will mean a lot more to a person than something that gets lost in the digital noise. You should send your thank-you note as soon as possible after the event has taken place, or after you have received your gift. Christmas is the only occasion where you have a week or so to respond, since everyone is so busy. Princess Diana supposedly started her thank-you letters before the event – it meant she never forgot. Don’t start with “thank you”, though: it is prosaic and predictable. Start with something personal about the experience or gift, then go on to the thank you. The more hospitality you have received, the longer the message should be. Try to make sure the stationery is fairly nice; some people use postcard-sized correspondence cards, so their notes are only a couple of lines long. If you are using paper, go for A5 and write a maximum of two separate pieces of paper. Never write on the back. I would send a gift in advance if I were going somewhere, or bring it with me and then follow it up afterwards with a note. If they have gone completely out of their way, you can send two gifts – no one is going to stop you.
