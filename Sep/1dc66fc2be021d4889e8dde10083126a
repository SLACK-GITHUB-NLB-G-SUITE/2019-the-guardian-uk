Alexis Sánchez has said he has no regrets about his move to Manchester United. The 30-year-old, who has joined Internazionale on loan for the rest of the season, scored only five goals in 45 appearances for United after arriving as their highest-paid player from Arsenal in January 2018. The Chilean, earning a reported £400,000 a week, came in for heavy criticism but insists he is glad he made the move. “I’m very happy I went to Manchester United,” Sánchez told BBC Sport. “I’ve always said that. It’s the club that has won the most in England. When I went to Arsenal it was fantastic – I was happy there – but United were growing at the time, they were buying players to win something. I wanted to join them and win everything. I don’t regret going there.” Sánchez scored 80 goals in 166 games for Arsenal after signing for £30m from Barcelona in July 2014, but suffered a major slump in form after joining United. He scored two Premier League goals in 27 appearances and made 31 starts out of a possible 77. “I’ve always said to my friends I want to play,” Sánchez said. “If they [United] would let me play I’ll do my best. Sometimes I’d play 60 minutes then I wouldn’t play the next game and I didn’t know why.”
