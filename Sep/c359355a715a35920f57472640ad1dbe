It’s only been 93 days since she gave birth to her second child but World Cup winner and Olympic gold medallist Sydney Leroux is already back on the pitch. The USA striker came on as a substitute during Orlando Pride’s 1-1 draw with Sky Blue FC on Sunday, completing a remarkable comeback after her daughter Roux was born on 28 June. It was her first appearance since last September, with Leroux - who has 77 caps for her country – having returned to training less than a month after giving birth. ‪I love this game. This past year was filled with so many ups and downs but I made a promise to myself that I would come back. No matter how hard that would be. It’s been a long road but I did it. 3 months and one day after I gave birth to my baby girl.‬ A post shared by  Sydney Leroux Dwyer (@sydneyleroux) on Sep 29, 2019 at 11:37am PDT She was afforded a standing ovation by the crowd in New Jersey, with Roux later joining her emotional mother on the pitch after the match. “I love this game,” Leroux wrote on Instagram. “This past year was filled with so many ups and downs but I made a promise to myself that I would come back. No matter how hard that would be. It’s been a long road but I did it. 3 months and one day after I gave birth to my baby girl.” Leroux already has a three-year-old son, Cassius, with her husband, Dom Dwyer – who also plays international football for the USA – and admitted they had been more prepared for the new addition to the family. “I feel like my life is more chaotic,” she said. “It’s easier this time around because I know what to expect but she’s only three months old so it was a quick turnaround. I’m proud of myself - it was a long journey.”
