I’ve been wearing tuxedos for as long as I can remember. This is the one I wore for the album artwork on Romantically Yours, which I released in 2011. I wore it very masculinely, with a shirt and an undone bow tie, but with a little bit of femininity from the diamanté belt. I spend my life in either skinny jeans or trousers. I love trouser suits, and the tux is just the dressed-up version of that. I just think they are elegant and really comfortable to wear. Every time you get invited to a black-tie do, it’s so easy for men – they just put on a tux and bow tie. Meanwhile, women go through the agonies of choosing a frock. I do sometimes wear dresses but often I think: ‘Oh, I’m just going to wear a tux.’ I think if you get a very beautiful woman in a black tuxedo with bow tie they look fabulous. On the cover of my first album, Twiggy, in 1976, I wore a white tuxedo and I had very long blond hair. It was my first pop album and that tux was made for me by Tommy Nutter, who was one of the great tailors and also one of my best friends. I used to go to Tommy and he’d make me a female equivalent of the suits in men’s stores, to better fit my shape. I’ve still got a few of them, although I can’t get into them any more – I was quite minute in those days! I claim to be the first well-known woman to wear brogues. I think I’ve probably got about 50 pairs now, all in different colours. You used not to be able to get brogues for women anywhere, so I went to the Prince of Wales’ shoemaker in Savile Row and had two-tone white and brown ones made for me because I was a huge fan of Fred Astaire. They have got satin ribbon laces and they are beautifully handmade. I’ve got them on a shelf now – they are kind of like works of art.
