Jo Johnson, the brother of the prime minister, has said he is stepping down as an MP and minister. His departure comes after it was announced in July that he would be returning to his previous position as a minister of state within the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. However, in a statement on Twitter, Johnson said it had been an honour to represent Orpington for nine years and to serve as a minister under three PMs. He wrote: “In recent weeks I’ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest – it’s an unresolvable tension and time for others to take on my roles as MP & minister.” He signed off: “#overandout.” Johnson had held this position from 2015 to 2018 under David Cameron and Theresa May but resigned from the government in November last year, when he accused May of offering MPs a choice between “vassalage and chaos” through her Brexit deal. A No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister would like to thank Jo Johnson for his service. He has been a brilliant, talented minister and a fantastic MP. The PM, as both a politician and brother, understands this will not have been an easy matter for Jo. “The constituents of Orpington could not have asked for a better representative.” It is understood that Jo Johnson will stand down as an MP at the next election. A former investment banker and journalist, Johnson was appointed director of the No 10 policy unit by Cameron in 2018. He has been closely associated with the remain wing of the Conservative party and joined other MPs last year in warning that May’s Brexit deal could lead to electoral armageddon for the Tories.
