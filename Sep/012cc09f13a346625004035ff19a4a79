It’s unusual for Pass notes to get it wrong, but Marilyns were, indeed, thought to be named after Norma Jeane (G2, 3 September). They are defined as isolated peaks with a prominence above 150 metres and first appeared in Alan Dawson’s book The Relative Hills of Britain (1992). The name is said to be a play on their better-known cousins, the Munros. Whether there is any other link between prominences and Marilyn Monroe is a matter of conjecture.Colin BarrUlverston, Cumbria • Regarding the “vegan halo” (G2, 3 September), someone told me he had become vegan “to save the planet for my six children”. A child apparently creates 58.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, and each infant produces almost 4,000 used disposable nappies that are sent to landfill. Perhaps a “vasectomy halo” might be more fairly bestowed?Kathleen RobertsHarrogate, North Yorkshire • It is good news that Peaky Blinders fans have flocked to explore the world associated with the BBC series (Report, 2 September). They should also look at another BBC Birmingham series, Gangsters. Originally broadcast as a Play for Today, it was shot in the city in the late 70s and attracted 12 million viewers. It also had a stellar BAME cast, including Paul Barber and Saeed Jaffrey.Stephen HughesLiverpool • Pride and Prejudice didn’t spark the start of modern screen tourism.
