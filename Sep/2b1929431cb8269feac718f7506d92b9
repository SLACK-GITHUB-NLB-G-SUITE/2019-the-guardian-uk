Neil Hamburger has this bit about Steven Tyler in a dunce’s cap that kills me even when I think about it. The Old Testament. The chapter on Sodom and Gomorrah is really something else. Filthy, too. FILTHY. Those Bible writers really worked blue. The Young Ones and The Comeback are perfection. Terrible Tom the Wild Turkey Causes Reporter to Lose Her Head, a YouTube video of a local reporter being chased by a turkey. OK, technically not a film, but it’s comic genius. It should be prescribed for depression. “What is happening?!? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!” over and over again by a drunk woman at [Edinburgh comedy show] Late’n’Live as I was helped off stage by security, who thought a pratfall was real and that my performance was actual concussion. It’s a toss-up between the afternoon when I went from waist-length hair to a mohawk and a waist-length rat’s tail for my year 10 school awards assembly, making Mr Ross my year advisor swear into a microphone, or the time I randomly cut chunks out of my hair in my 20s. I looked like a Barbie that belonged to a disturbed five-year-old and I lost a lot of friends. Zoë Coombs Marr: Bossy Bottom, Soho Theatre, W1, Monday 9 to 21 September
