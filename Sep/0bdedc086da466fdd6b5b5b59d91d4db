On Thursday morning, the eye of Hurricane Dorian was off the coast of South Carolina, moving north-north-east at 8mph. The center of the storm was projected to remain just off the eastern US seaboard, moving past South Carolina late in the day. Dorian regained strength to category 3 status overnight but it returned to category 2 status late on Thursday morning. It still threatened severe storm surges and flooding, if not destruction on the scale visited upon the northern Bahamas. On Abaco and Grand Bahama, whole neighborhoods were flattened and at least 20 people killed after the storm made landfall on Sunday then stalled over the islands. Here’s what the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) is expecting from the storm in the next few days. The NHC said that while the edge of Dorian’s center was not far from the South Carolina coast, the storm was expected to turn north-eastward through Thursday. This will bring the eye of the storm “near or over the coasts” of South Carolina and southern North Carolina. Dorian was expected to weaken as it moves along the coast but the NHC advised residents to be prepared for “damaging winds, life-threatening storm surges, and flooding rains”. The center of Dorian may move near or over the coast of North Carolina early on Friday before making a faster exit further into the Atlantic ocean. If it hit North Carolina after regaining strength again, it would be the first category 3 hurricane to hit the state since 1996. Forecasters detailed a high risk of flash flooding on the coasts of North and South Carolina and a moderate risk of flash flooding in Virginia. Tornadoes were spotted across the Carolinas on Thursday, because of the strong winds from Dorian. The NHC projected Dorian to head into south-eastern New England on Friday night and Saturday morning, before approaching Nova Scotia later on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions were deemed possible in portions of south-eastern Massachusetts as early as late Friday night.
