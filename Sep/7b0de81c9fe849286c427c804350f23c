Tell us about the eye-catching modern architecture and interior design you’ve loved and lingered over on your European and UK travels. Whether it’s a gallery, a cafe, library, restaurant or railway station – any example of striking modern design or revamp – we want to hear your favourites, but please describe (at least in part) publicly accessible buildings and spaces only. Please include details of exact locations with any relevant websites and entry price information. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
