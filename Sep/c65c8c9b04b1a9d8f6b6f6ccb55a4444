As he hacked along the slippery chalk trail, he decided to create a lightweight, all-adventure bike that would put foul-weather capability first. His thinking was that a bike that ‘thrives in winter will survive summer, however a bike that thrives in summer will die in winter’. The main zone of conflict between an off-roader and a pool of gloopy mud, is the gear mechanism. The sprockets get clogged with dirt and grime. For this reason, rather than fitting exposed traditional derailleurs, he chose to fit enclosed, reliable, weather-beating Pinion gearboxes linked to super-durable Gates Carbondrive CDX belts. His early bike models were named after some of his favourite pubs from along the South Downs Way – the Lamb, the Ram and the Swan. Since then he has created three new models with differing geometry to suit the style of riding you do, with rather less poetic names – the N1, N2 and N3. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still stop for a few pints. Stay Sixty’s steel water bottle is sustainable and has an ingenious twist’n’sip cap.
