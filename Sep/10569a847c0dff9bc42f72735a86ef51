Australia’s world time trial champion Rohan Dennis has had his contract with race team Bahrain-Merida terminated with immediate effect. Dennis, who retained his global crown at the UCI world championships in England this week, has not raced for Bahrain-Merida since the Tour de France in July, which he abandoned after stage 12 without explanation. On Wednesday, the 29-year-old Adelaide rider powered to his time trial defence in Yorkshire wearing a Australian national race skin suit. An official announcement of the termination came during Sunday’s elite men’s road race, in which Dennis was supporting Australia’s lead rider Michael Matthews. Bahrain-Merida’s statement revealed the announcement had been delayed to allow Dennis to prepare fully for the worlds. “The team terminated its contract with Mr Dennis on 13th September 2019,” the statement read. “This termination has not previously been made public to allow Mr Dennis an undisturbed preparation for the UCI 2019 Road World Championships. “Mr Dennis has referred the termination to the UCI arbitral board. Against this background, no further comment will be made at this time.”
