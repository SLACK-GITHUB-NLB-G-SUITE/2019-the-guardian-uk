Richard Carapaz, the Giro d’Italia winner and future Team Ineos cyclist, has been forced to withdraw from the 2019 Tour of Britain after failing to receive his visa in time. The 26-year-old had been set to race for Movistar, making his debut in the race which began in Glasgow on Saturday. “Sadly, and despite the Movistar team following all procedures, Richard Carapaz’s visa for the Tour of Britain has not been granted in time for him to travel,” Movistar said in a statement on Twitter. The Ecuadorian rider’s absence is a blow for his current team, and a race whose status has grown significantly in recent years. It is also less than ideal for Ineos, the British team that Caparaz will join for next season on a three-year deal. They will be led in their home race by British road race champion Ben Swift, who signed a contract extension on Friday. Spain’s Héctor Carretero will replace Carapaz for Movistar in a field that still features plenty of big names. Dylan Groenewegen and Mike Teunissen, both of whom won stages at this year’s Tour de France, will race for Team Jumbo-Visma, while Mark Cavendish lines up for the Dimension Data team. This year’s Tour of Britain features eight stages, with the peloton travelling 201.5km from Glasgow to Kirkcudbright on Saturday’s opening stage. The race will also visit Newcastle, Kendal and Birkenhead, among others, before finishing in Manchester next Saturday.
