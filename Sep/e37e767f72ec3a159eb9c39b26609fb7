Strictly returns, and with it all of the traditions of autumn: conkers, stewed apples, the smell of smoke on the air, a kid turning up to school in mittens six weeks after blowing his fingers off with a firework, truffling for hedgehogs under dormant bonfire piles, wondering which celebrities are going to shag each other after a 10-week stint of rubbing up crotch-to-crotch in sequinned Lycra catsuits. Still hosted by Claudia Winkleman (once you defeat all the other fun aunts in combat, you must defeat Winkleman, the funnest aunt of all) and Tess Daly (what if a witch cursed a can of Elnett to live as a person?), still camp, still right on the edge of true glamour, still entirely baffling to the lay viewer, ie me. Strictly Come Dancing (Sat, 7pm, BBC One) is a lightheartedly competitive dance show that is still rigorously ruled by ancient stone tablets engraved with edicts and stored in a holy room at the back of the BBC archives; ones that producers are too scared to deviate from in case they bring down an ancient blood curse like the one that already claimed Jamie Laing’s foot. So: Thou Shalt Always Hath a Slightly Clumsy Former Competitive Athlete Who Is Like 6’ 4” And Rhythmless (James Cracknell, David James); Thou Shalt Always Hath a Soap Actress Who Really Really Wants This (Catherine Tyldesley, Emma Barton); Thou Shalt Hath a Cheerful-Faced Breakfast TV Sub-Presenter Who Shall Dad Dance Throughout, Out By Week Two (Mike Bushell); Thou Shalt Hath a Comedian Who Will Never Quite Decide If He Wants To Be “Comedy-Bad” Or Just “Bad-Bad” (Chris Ramsey); Wherever Possible, Thou Shalt Hath Anneka Rice (Anneka Rice). This is a show that had to drip feed the idea of having Claudia Winkleman replace a 1,000-year-old Bruce Forsyth by having her alternate one-week-on, one-week-off for an entire series just so the viewing public wouldn’t riot. It is not a show that is built for change. Good, then, that the Strictly discourse is still what it is. To catch you up, say if you get into conversation with a Strictly fan at a dinner party (?), here are the main flare-ups: the sheer idea of a same-sex dancing partnership is so revolutionary that, if the BBC were to ever do it, an entire swathe of middle England would die instantly of a mass anger heart attack; they have started letting vloggers on and nobody knows who these vloggers are; Craig Revel Horwood, a man hired to be as decisively mean as it is possible to be without moving your jaw, is simply too decisively mean; the one competitor who has previous dancing experience is too good and they are ruining it. The other constants: Tess Daly’s hand gestures, akin to a robot trying to overcome its pre-programmed desire to strangle; all of the male professional dancers looking like those F1 drivers who only ever last one season; the lad they have on who appears to be an actual vampire who everyone seems to ignore due to the fact that he is an actual vampire; Anton du Beke still there, the ghost at the feast; everyone trying to do elastic “dancing faces”, like your uncle playing charades and trying to convey the phrase “fatal orgasm”. See you again next autumn for more of the exact, exact same.
