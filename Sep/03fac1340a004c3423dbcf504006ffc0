Steve Clarke has challenged Oli McBurnie to demonstrate his dedication to Scotland with performances. The Sheffield United striker caused a storm last week among Scotland fans by making apparently disparaging comments about the international setup that were inadvertently picked up on a club video. “I’m sure the supporters will get right behind the team,” said Clarke, who is likely to start McBurnie against Russia at Hampden on Friday night. “The best thing he can do is go out, play really well and show everybody how committed he is. If he wants, he could score a goal. That would be nice as well.” McBurnie had offered an explanation to his Scotland teammates in full public view before training on Monday. “We could have done it inside but it was better to do it outside,” the manager said. “Clarified and clear. We have moved on and we urge everyone else to move on from it. Finished. “If he didn’t want to be here, he wouldn’t be here. That’s the bottom line. He had never worked with me before. He has no reason to say: ‘I don’t want to go,’ because he didn’t know what it was like. After the game you can quiz him and he will tell you he enjoyed it.” Russia are three points ahead of Scotland in a Euro 2020 qualifying group in which Belgium, who visit Hampden on Monday, appear destined to win. Clarke senses his team are overdue a shock result. “It’s been a long time since Scotland had a win where everyone went: ‘Ooof, where did that come from?’” Clarke said. “As a nation we like to get excited. It’s one of those results that we need. It’s a chance at home against Russia to set down a marker and say we are still in this group and fighting to get out of it.” Scotland (4-3-2-1, possible) Marshall; O’Donnell, Cooper, Mulgrew, Robertson; McTominay, McGinn, McGregor; Forrest, Fraser; McBurnie. Russia (4-5-1, possible) Guilherme; Kudryashov, Dzhikiya, Semenov, Fernandes; Zobnin, Golivin, Yerokhin, Cheryshev, Ionov; Dzyuba.
