Cut 2 large aubergines, about 350g each in weight, into 1cm slices. Lay them on a roasting tray or baking sheet. Season. Peel and thinly slice 4 cloves of garlic, scatter over the aubergine slices then pour over 8 tbsp of olive oil. Let the aubergines cook under a moderately hot overhead grill for 7-10 minutes, turning them over as they start to soften and begin to go gold in colour. Season and lightly oil a piece of bavette steak, about 700g in weight. Place a wire rack over the aubergines then lay the bavette on top. Set the grill to high, place the steak and aubergines under the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes, then turn the steak and cook the other side. Remove the meat and rack from the roasting grill and place in a warm place, lightly covered, to rest for 8-10 minutes. Check the aubergines are thoroughly soft and golden. If they are not, then return them to the grill, turning them as necessary, while the meat rests. Toss the aubergine and any meat juices together, adding 10 large basil leaves as you go. Spoon the aubergines on to a serving plate, lay the steak on top and serve. Enough for 2. Get the grill really hot for cooking the steak. If you doubt your overhead grill, then cook it separately on a hot griddle or flash fry it in a heavy frying pan. Pour any meat juices over the aubergines. Include a few onions, sliced thinly, with the aubergine. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
