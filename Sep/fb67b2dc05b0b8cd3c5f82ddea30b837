Enable continued the smooth buildup to her attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe three times, when she made what could well be her final visit to a British racecourse on Wednesday morning. John Gosden’s mare exercised under her regular jockey Frankie Dettori on Newmarket’s Rowley Mile course, covering a mile with the useful handicapper Crossed Baton and finishing just in front of her galloping companion. “I’m very pleased with her work,” Gosden said afterwards. “I wanted her to just stay with her lead horse and she’s had a good, healthy blow. It went to plan, and that doesn’t always happen with work mornings. “Frankie said she pulled all the way down to the rubbing house [before starting the gallop]. She’s worked exactly how we wanted, she enjoys coming to a racecourse and she seems very happy now. “She’s going to have to be in top form to win the Arc. I don’t think she’s going to go winning it off what she did last year. You always have to be in top order to win a race like that.” Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to Enable’s owner, Prince Khalid Abdullah, was also in attendance and confirmed that all has gone well in the build-up to her final race. “Her preparation has been straightforward, we’ve had no issues and she’s been in good form,” Grimthorpe said. “It was a good, solid piece of work and just what everyone seemed to want to see. Frankie was happy with her.”  Enable is generally top-priced at 8-11 to win her third Arc next Sunday, with Aidan O’Brien’s Japan next in the betting at 13-2. The International Stakes winner is just ahead of Sotsass, who took the French Derby in June, on 7-1. Ghaiyyath is a 12-1 shot and it is 16-1 bar. Ed Arkell, the clerk of the course at Goodwood, described the track as “slightly soggy” this morning in a going update on Twitter, proving himself a master of understatement as he did so. “The ground is soft, heavy in places,” he continued. “We’ve had 58.6mm of rain since Monday afternoon. The forecast is for a little more patchy rain [and] heavy showers this morning, then starting to clear away and brightening up a little this afternoon.” Inevitably, the change in the ground from good when the final declarations were made on Monday has prompted a series of non-runners, and every race on the card now has at least one absentee.

Ralph Beckett’s filly has winning form on good-to-soft going and notched her second victory in her last three starts when upped to 12 furlongs for the first time at Leicester last month. She has looked a little quirky in the closing stages at times but there is little wrong with the bulk of her form and another step up in trip could see further progress.Air Pilot (3.40), a 10-year-old, is at least six years older than all five of his remaining rivals in the Listed Foundation Stakes but he remains relatively lightly-raced for a horse of his vintage and also has plenty of form with cut in the ground, including a Group Two victory on heavy going in April last year. He is worth an interest at around 5-1, along with Tukhoom (2.30) in the claiming handicap, while Lydiate Lady (2.20) and Round The Island (3.25) should both go well on the card at Redcar.
