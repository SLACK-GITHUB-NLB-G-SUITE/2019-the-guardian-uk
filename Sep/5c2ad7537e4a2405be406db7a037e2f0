In her article (3 September) on the abuses and misjudgments of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings in their time in the education department, Fiona Millar mentions an oft-used “fact” about the Conservative reforms: that the number of students in good and outstanding schools has increased “incrementally” (or, if you ask CCHQ, 1.9 million children). At face value, this is true. But the truth is far more complex. In 2012, Ofsted changed the “satisfactory” rating to “requires improvement” – a clear shift in language and tone, making the third category far more damning and lowering the standard of the second category, which seemed to include the “slightly above average” schools. The percentage of children at good and outstanding schools (according to the government’s own numbers) jumped 10% in the following year, clearly a direct result of this change. By 2016, the percentage had reached its peak. This is perhaps not a coincidence. Satisfactory schools used to be checked every three years, meaning that the last satisfactory school would have had its rating changed (most likely to “good”) by the 2015 checks. There is enough in these statistics to suggest that one of the primary reasons why the number of good and outstanding schools has increased is this administrative change, and not a sudden and dramatic improvement in educational standards. Millar somewhat begrudgingly attempts to look at the positive impact that Gove has had in an otherwise critical article; Gove does not deserve even this.Lorenzo MontaniSemington, Wiltshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
