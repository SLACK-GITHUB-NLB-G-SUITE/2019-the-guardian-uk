“If you’ve always wanted to know what’s in a traffic patrol car, here you go.” On 1 September, the police department of the Swiss canton of Zurich sparked more curiosity than they sated by posting an image of two police officers, six traffic cones, a broom, two hand guns and dozens of other pieces of neatly arranged policing paraphernalia to their Facebook page. The arrangement – known to fans of graphic design and internet miscellanea as knolling – won the police department several thousand Facebook likes. “Every Sunday I post an exciting, nice or funny picture from the police everyday life on Facebook and Instagram,” Rebecca Tilen, the Zurich police department’s press officer told the Guardian. The photograph was taken during a department open day. “We had issued such a police car and spread the contents next to it. Two policemen then had the idea to join in as well. The photo was finally taken with a drone.” Soon other Swiss emergency response organisations, like the Thusis fire department, mimicked the Lego-set layout, in what has become known as the Tetris Challenge. #TetrisChallenge du Service d’Incendie et de Secours (SIS) de Genève 🚒🚒🚒 ça en fait du matériel à embarquer ! #geneve #igersgeneva #geneva #thingsorganizedneatly #firefighter #firefighters #pompiers #switzerland #inlovewithswitzerland #suisse A post shared by  Ville de Genève (@ville_de_geneve) on Sep 12, 2019 at 2:22am PDT “We were immensely happy and encouraged others to join us. It was followed by rescue services, fire departments, other police departments, but also private companies participated,” Tilen says. From there, the challenge spread to the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria and Germany. A nemzetközi porondon már egy ideje hódít az az új kihívás mentősök, tűzoltók és rendőrök körében, ami Magyaroszágon a Készenléti Rendőrség által készített fotóval most indul hivatalosan útjára. A képen egy bevetési és dokumentációs feladatok ellátására alkalmas eszközökkel felszerelt járőrautó látható. A kihívás nem is lehet teljes kihívott nélkül: a mi választásunk a Fejér megyei Autópálya Alosztályra esett. Hajrá, FMRFK, izgatottan várjuk, mit rejtenek a Ti járműveitek. #challange #tetrischallenge #policecars #missioncompleted #whatismycar #készenlétirendőrség #rendőrség #police #hivatás A post shared by  Magyar Rendőrség (@police_hu) on Sep 9, 2019 at 9:08am PDT Then, it went global with Singapore’s civil defence force posting a gallery of emergency response teams in taking the challenge. First responders in Mexico and Taiwan also participated. Tilen says she had no problem convincing the original officers to take the photograph. “It is a self-runner. The different departments all over the world try to constantly confront each other with even more funny ideas.” Aha... we've seen the latest online trending #TetrisChallenge where netizens from other countries get a look at their respective emergency responders' sprawl of equipment and guess what, we in The Life Saving Force simply could not resist sharing with you what we have too! By the way, remember, every non-emergency call made to 995 could delay our response to life-threatening emergencies. #995ForEmergenciesOnly 📸: Sengkang Fire Station A post shared by  SCDF (@myscdf) on Sep 13, 2019 at 6:25pm PDT TCPB 警察[守護交通安全組合]開箱囉！ 自國外捲起一陣警消開箱風， 我們TCPB局長室也不能落人後， 請來我們交大同仁開箱日常勤務裝備囉~ 為了市民的用路安全, 我們同仁平常都攜帶這些裝備在各個街頭守護著。 這樣攤開擺放， 在這角度看來是不是讓人莫名的療癒呀~ #TCPB #警察 #開箱 #police #警察開箱挑戰 #tetrischallenge A post shared by  TCPB局長室 (@tcpb_commissioner) on Sep 15, 2019 at 8:58pm PDT Para este 15 de Septiembre 2019 #TetrisChallenge #TetrisChallengeMexico un Fraternal Saludo¡¡ @DavidLeonRomero @rescateurbanomx @alertasurbanas @SASEMEP_IPN pic.twitter.com/BEGMwviMLy In New Zealand, the police department created a near identical image in November 2018. #flatlay pic.twitter.com/60byoMxbdK They subsequently reposted the image in response to the Tetris Challenge. In June, a review of the New Zealand police’s social media use found that New Zealand police should post fewer memes and “puppy pics”. In the audit, posts such as the #flatlay image above, were praised as “great for viral pick up”. Tilen says: “Since the challenge, our number of followers has once again increased and so our prevention campaigns and our witnesses searches have more reach, which is good for us.”
