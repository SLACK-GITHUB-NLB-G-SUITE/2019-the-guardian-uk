A middle school football player in Oklahoma has died after competing in a game, the second teenager to do so in the state in a matter of weeks. Lexington High School football coach Dale Berglan told the Oklahoman that Riley Boatwright died on Tuesday after playing a game in Stratford. Officials with the Lexington public schools district confirmed the death with KOCO-TV, Oklahoma City’s ABC affiliate. A cause of death has not been disclosed. Officials with the school district told the station they will provide counselors and safe spaces for student and staff in the coming days to share their memories and feelings after their classmate’s death. Boatwright’s death is the second this month of a scholastic football player in Oklahoma. Sixteen-year-old Peter Webb died on 15 September after suffering an apparent head injury during a game. He played for Southwest Covenant in the Oklahoma City suburb of Yukon.
