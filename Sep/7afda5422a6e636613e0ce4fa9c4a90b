Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea, nine months after he handed in a transfer request in an attempt to force a move to Bayern Munich. The 18-year-old forward, who is close to returning to the first team after an achilles injury, has received a substantial wage increase to £120,000 a week. Hudson-Odoi’s deal to 2024 is part of a push at Chelsea to secure their most talented young players to long contracts. He follows Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek in committing his future to the club, and talks are under way with Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori. Frustration at a lack of first-team appearances under Maurizio Sarri prompted Hudson-Odoi to seek a transfer to Bayern in January but he subsequently played more matches and was encouraged by the appointment of Frank Lampard as head coach last summer. Hudson-Odoi told Chelsea’s website: “It’s been a long wait but it’s done now and I’m really happy about that. I’ve been a Chelsea player since I was eight and this is the right club for me to be at.” Lampard spoke of his high regard for the player, who has two international caps. “He can be central to this team and for England,” Lampard said. “I want to work with him, I want to drive him forward and I want to improve him as a player. Callum can show, right here at Chelsea, the club he came through the academy at, that he is going to be a world-class player because I truly believe that.”
