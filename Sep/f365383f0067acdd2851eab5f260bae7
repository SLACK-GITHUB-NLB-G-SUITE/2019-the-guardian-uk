The talented but troubled jockey Graham Gibbons has been jailed, following his fourth conviction for drink driving. The verdict was recorded last week at Harrogate magistrates court and resulted in the 37-year-old being committed to prison for 16 weeks, disqualified from driving for five years and fined a victim surcharge of £149. It is the latest of several examples of Gibbons making trouble for himself and throws into question whether he will ever be able to recover his licence to ride in races. He last rode as a jockey in December 2016, until a urine sample taken from him while he was riding at Kempton returned positive for a metabolite of cocaine. He was eventually given a lengthy ban, six months for failing the test and a further two years for having coerced a teenage apprentice jockey into swapping urine samples with him in an attempt to avoid that positive test. That led to a finding by the British Horseracing Authority of conduct prejudicial to the sport. But it appears Gibbons believed he was making headway with his latest application and hoped to resume the career he began in January 2000, which at one time looked like turning him into a star name. He built his reputation when delivering a 22-1 shock in the Lincoln Handicap of 2006 aboard Blythe Knight, the first time he had ridden the horse in public, and he was at one time seen as the most effective Flat-race jockey based in the north. The most valuable success of his career came four years ago, when he won the Gimcrack Stakes for the trainer William Haggas aboard Ajaya. The veteran North Yorkshire-based trainer David Barron, who has provided Gibbons with close to 200 winners over the years, continues to be a supporter and has been giving him employment as a work rider. “He’d been here once or twice a week, sometimes more than that depending on whether we needed him,” Barron told the Racing Post. “That’s been going on since the start of the year and he could have race-ridden tomorrow. “It’s an awful shame because he’s a very talented lad but he has a problem that he struggles with. He has a tremendous amount of ability but it’s an illness and he needs help.” Gibbons’ struggles with alcohol first came to public notice in 2007, when he was the first jockey in Britain to be found over the drink-drive limit when taking a breath test at the races. The Guardian understands that some jockeys are concerned about the prospect of Gibbons recovering his licence, on the grounds that it could pose a threat to their safety if he were to ride under the influence of drink or drugs. The BHA declined to confirm whether any such concerns had been brought to its attention.
