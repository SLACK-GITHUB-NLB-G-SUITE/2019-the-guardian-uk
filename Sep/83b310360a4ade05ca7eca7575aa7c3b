The United States men’s basketball team nearly saw their 54-game win streak at major tournaments come to end on Tuesday before rallying in overtime for a 93-92 win over Turkey in Fiba World Cup group-stage play at the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center. Khris Middleton, who led the Americans with 15 points, made a pair of free throws with 2.1 seconds left to put the two-time defending champions ahead by one and Turkey’s Ersan Ilyasova missed a three-pointer at the buzzer to preserve a victory that secured the US team’s passage into the second round. “It was a heck of a game,” US coach Gregg Popovich said. “As we all know, it was anybody’s game. We will accept the win.” USA saw their 78-game win streak in major tournaments and exhibitions with NBA players snapped by Australia two weeks ago in a pre-tournament tune-up, but Tuesday’s thriller marked the closest margin for the American men at the Olympics or the World Cup (formerly known as the world championships) since a six-point loss to Greece in the 2006 semi-finals of this event. Kemba Walker, who single-handedly erased a five-point US deficit in overtime with a three-pointer and another score sandwiched by his drawing an offensive foul, added 14 points in a game where Jayson Tatum had to make two of three free throws with one-tenth of a second left in regulation to save them. Ilyasova, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, led Turkey with 23 points. Melih Mahmutoglu had 18, Furkan Korkmaz scored 16 and Cedi Osman added 15 for Turkey. The win clinched a second-round berth for the US, but only after Osman and Dogus Balbay went 0-for-4 from the line with Turkey up by one in the final seconds of overtime. Balbay missed a pair following an intentional foul with the US down one, and Osman missed two more about a second later. Those misses by Osman set up the last US possession, one where Tatum controlled a rebound, brought the ball down and found Middleton for a drive to the rim. Tatum went down, leaving the game with sprained left ankle. The US didn’t go down with him. Middleton made both, Ilyasova missed a jumper for Turkey as time expired and the US survived. “It really hurts,” Turkey’s Korkmaz said. “I think it was in our hands – not their hands.” Ilyasova’s tip-in with 12.3 seconds remaining in regulation gave Turkey their first lead at 81-79. Turkey had gone 0-for-9 on shots to take the lead before Ilyasova’s swat bounced off the rim and dropped through the net.

He got fouled by Osman as he took a three-point attempt from the top of the key; the scoreboard showed no time left, but officials put one-tenth of a second on after review. He made the first. The second rimmed out. The third, with the game on the line, rattled home. Turkey had a chance on the final play of regulation, but a lob to the rim got knocked away easily, sending the game to OT. The US ran out to a quick 10-2 lead and never trailed in the half, though it was far too close for the Americans’ comfort. It was 26-21 after the first quarter, though it seemed like the Americans had control again when they led 41-26 with 5:33 left in the half. That’s when Turkey got a spark by a guard born in Gainesville, Florida. Scottie Wilbekin, who played four years of college ball for Florida and got his Turkish passport last year, fueled a 12-0 run that awoke the pro-Turkey crowd of 18,000. He got it going with a three-pointer, fed Ilyasova for another three not long afterward and converted a four-point play with 3:12 left in the half. And it stayed tight the rest of the way, all the way to the end. “I need mental strength to overcome this,” Turkey coach Ufuk Sarica said. The US improve to 3-0 against Turkey, after meetings in each of the last three World Cups. The Americans endured a raucous home crowd to beat Turkey 81-64 in the gold-medal game of the world championships at Istanbul in 2010, then rallied from a five-point halftime deficit to beat Turkey 98-77 in the second game of the 2014 World Cup. Popovich’s side can clinch first place in Group E when they face Japan on Thursday in the final game of the preliminary stage. In other Tuesday action, Canada were knocked out of the 32-nation tournament after a 92-69 drubbing by Lithuania, as Brazil shocked Greece 79-78 while the Dominican Republic stunned Germany 70-68. Having suffered a 108-92 defeat by Australia, the Canadians left themselves no chance of progressing after they were torn apart by a rock-solid Lithuanian side. Lithuania never looked back after winning the first quarter 24-14 and built on that lead against a disjointed Canada, whose coach Nick Nurse suffered a painful exit after steering the Toronto Raptors to the 2019 NBA title. Six Lithuanian players ended in double scoring digits to wipe out a valiant solo effort by Canada’s Kyle Wiltjer, the game’s top scorer with 24 points. Greece face a decider against New Zealand to advance from their preliminary pool while Brazil booked their last-16 berth after Anderson Varejao racked up 22 points and nine rebounds for the South American side. The Greeks missed a chance to force overtime as Kostas Sloukas missed one of three free throws with two seconds left while Giannis Antetokounmpo, last season’s Most Valuable Player in the NBA regular season, was held to 13 points. New Zealand kept alive their hopes of advancing with a 93-83 defeat of Montenegro as Corey Webster scored 25 points and towering centre Isaac Fotu added 20, while Australia breezed to an 81-68 victory over Senegal. The Czech Republic will battle it out with Turkey for a spot in the second group stage after an 89-76 win against Japan while France hardly broke sweat in a 103-64 rout of Jordan. Serbia, the tournament favourites alongside the United States, face Italy in Wednesday’s standout fixture. The top two teams from each of the eight preliminary pools will advance to the second group stage.
