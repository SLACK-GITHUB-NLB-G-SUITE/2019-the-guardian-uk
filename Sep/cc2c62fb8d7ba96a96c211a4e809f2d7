A no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday. Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU. But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.
