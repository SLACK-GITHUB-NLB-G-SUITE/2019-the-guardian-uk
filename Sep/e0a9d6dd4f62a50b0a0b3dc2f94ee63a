Brexit will have a profound effect on the rights and wellbeing of women. The principle of equality between men and women is enshrined in EU law; many employment rights, maternity rights, trafficking laws and measures to combat violence against women and girls are derived from EU treaties and directives. These protections do not only fight current levels of discrimination against women; they also provide a structural basis for eliminating it from our society. However, as illustrated in a report published this week by the campaign group Best for Britain, Brexit will put these protections at risk and will mean that future EU equality and human rights protections are not binding in UK law. Through the removal of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and no British replacement lined up to the EU charter of fundamental rights, Brexit will remove existing avenues of protection and leave women in the UK more vulnerable to abuse. We are at a profound moment in UK history, and the fight to protect the rights of women is real. The EU has made huge progress over the past 45 years in protecting rights both for women now and in the future. The government has a duty to ensure we do not turn back the clock on this critical issue. We call on the government to lay out its plans to keep these vital laws and regulations in place.
