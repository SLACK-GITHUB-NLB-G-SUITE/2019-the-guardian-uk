US rapper Cardi B has detailed a sexual assault she experienced during a magazine photoshoot. Speaking to TV and radio host Angie Martinez, she said: “I went to shoot for this magazine and the photographer, he was trying to get close to me like, ‘Yeah, you want to get in this magazine?’ Then he pulled his dick out. I was so fucking mad … You know what’s crazy? I told the magazine owner and he just looked at me like, ‘So? And?’” She did not name the photographer or magazine, nor when the incident occurred. Cardi added: “When I see the #MeToo movement – there’s girls from the hood I know that went through the same type of treatment. They make you feel like you got to do a certain type of thing. It happens every day.” She had previously alluded to the incident in a 2018 interview, saying: “I bet if one of these women stands up and talks about it, people are going to say, ‘So what? You’re a ho. It don’t matter.’” The rapper broke through in 2017 and has since earned five Grammy nominations and a US No 1 with her debut album Invasion of Privacy. She recently starred alongside Jennifer Lopez in the crime film Hustlers, and is set to present Rhythm + Flow, a hip-hop talent show on Netflix, alongside TI and Chance the Rapper. She recently appeared in a video for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. In June she pleaded not guilty alongside two others to 12 charges including assault, after an alleged fight at a New York strip club in August 2018.
