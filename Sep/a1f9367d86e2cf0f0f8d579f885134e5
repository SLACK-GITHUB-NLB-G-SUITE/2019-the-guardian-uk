The New Zealand government is supporting an industry push to trademark manuka honey in China and shut Australia out of the market. Manuka honey is a highly-prized commodity across the world, particularly China, for its antibacterial properties. The honey is produced in southern Australian states and New Zealand where bees gather the nectar of the manuka tree. While manuka honey is produced on both sides of the Tasman, the NZ industry is shooting for a monopoly into the lucrative Chinese market. Kiwi producers are to apply to the Beijing intellectual property court to obtain the Chinese certification trademark that would link the manuka name to New Zealand alone, Nine newspapers have reported. If successful, Australian producers would need to market under a different name – despite it being from the same source. The New Zealand trade minister, David Parker, says the application carries the government’s support, despite likely protests from Australia.

The Kiwi industry is considered further advanced than its Australian counterpart. The chairman of the Australian Manuka Honey Association, Paul Callendar, has urged the Australian government to intervene. “The New Zealand government is involved. This is a major trade issue and the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Trade have got to get involved,” Callander told Nine newspapers.
