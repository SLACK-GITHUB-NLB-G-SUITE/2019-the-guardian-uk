Lorius Karius had a night to forget as Besiktas lost 4-2 to Slovan Bratislava on a Europa League evening filled with surprise scorelines. Austriaâ€™s Wolfsberger AC won 4-0 at MÃ¶nchengladbach, while Bulgariaâ€™s Ludogorets thumped CSKA Moscow 5-1. In the dayâ€™s earlier games, Luxembourgâ€™s Dudelange stunned Apoel Nicosia with a 4-3 win in Cyprus while Lazio slumped to a 2-1 away defeat against Cluj. Karius was at fault for the hostsâ€™ opening goal in Slovakia, charging off his line to deal with a long ball but misjudging it completely, allowing Slovan striker Andraz Sporar to slot home. Besiktas rallied to lead 2-1 at half-time, before Sporar struck again on the hour mark. With the game heading for a draw, the hosts struck twice in stoppage time through Marin Ljubicic and Mohammed Rharsalla. The result leaves Group K wide open, after Wolves were beaten by Braga at Molineux in their opener.

The hosts then rallied dramatically, scoring three goals in four minutes. Andrija Pavlovic netted either side of Tomas de Vincentiâ€™s penalty to put the Cypriot side 3-2 ahead in the Group A match. Dudelangeâ€™s hopes of a shock looked over, but goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert produced a string of saves to keep them within one goal, before Dominik Stolz grabbed an equaliser and Sinaniâ€™s second goal eight minutes from time snatched victory.
