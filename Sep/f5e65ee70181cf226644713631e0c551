As a GP I read your article about testosterone replacement therapy with interest (‘My energy and drive are back’, G2, 9 September). I was disappointed it did not mention the 2016 review that concluded that testosterone supplementation for “low-T” is not supported by evidence. It is not due to lack of awareness that I rarely prescribe testosterone for “low-T”, but lack of evidence. I am sure that is also true of many of my colleagues.Dr Alan PetrieGlasgow • I know someone who has had his testosterone blocked to stop the progression of prostate cancer. He is fairly happy; he is still alive, can read, listen to music and has climbed many hills since. I hope men without testosterone won’t feel they have to succumb to misery. Brexit worries him far more.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife • Disaster tourism isn’t new (Whaley Bridge dry and high as damaged dam draws in tourists, 10 September). In 1852 there was a railway excursion to the scene of the great Holmfirth flood that year, and in 1967, thousands of sightseers descended on the scene of the terrible Stockport plane crash.Susan MajorYork • In two places on page 3 of Tuesday’s G2, animals are referred to as being the size of dogs. In one case, rats in Liverpool, in the other, a cat-like creature in East Yorkshire. Since dogs are somewhat variable in size, this description is not very helpful. Perhaps someone could come up with a standard dog for such occurrences, so it could be used with the same confidence as, for example, Wales, for area?Penelope StanfordNew Ash Green, Kent • Why are so many Guardian readers (Letters, passim) going to the tax-avoiding Starbucks?Jed O’NeillSheffield • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
