Share your experiences of autumnal breaks in the UK, whether they were town-based, or involved outdoor activities. Tell us about markets, seasonal and harvest food festivals in towns and villages, and other cultural events – anything that might make a good basis for a short break. Autumn is also a good time for a coastal break; much of the UK’s shoreline seems to come alive at this time of year with crashing waves and unpredictable weather making that evening pub visit all the more pleasurable. Please include details of places to stay that you’d recommend, venues offering attractions and events this autumn and any particularly good walking routes you’ve discovered with places to view the changing colours of the landscape. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
