This recipe was made by accident. Whenever a Marvel film comes around, my friends and I always find time to go to the cinema and, of course, snacks are essential. While we all get popcorn, we also have our speciality snacks: Babs has a pasta bowl, George a smoothie and Henry goes for honey-roasted nuts. I have caramel popcorn, which recently Henry went and tipped his nuts into, and it inspired today’s recipe... we’re talking honey caramel with a few extra tasty twists. Leave the popcorn to cool completely before breaking into chunks. Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4-6 3 tbsp vegetable oil100g popcorn2 tsp fine sea salt200g salted peanuts, chopped For the honey caramel110g honey150g caster sugar70g unsalted butter, chopped, plus extra for greasing Grease and line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a large saucepan for which you have a fitted lid, heat the oil over a medium heat for a couple of minutes, then add the popcorn and cover. When the corn starts to pop, give the pan a good shake. When the corn stops popping, tip it into a large bowl, sprinkle over the salt and peanuts, and give it a good stir. Put the honey, sugar and butter into a saucepan over a low heat. Cook, stirring, for eight minutes, until the sugar dissolves. Next, boil the caramel, without stirring, for five minutes until golden. Quickly pour the caramel over the popcorn and stir until well coated. Tip the popcorn into the prepared tin, leave to cool completely, then roughly break up into chunks.
