Italy scored three tries within the space of 10 minutes, either side of half-time, to give themselves breathing room against a stubborn Namibia before recording a 47-22 win at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium in Osaka on Sunday. Damian Stevens scored an early try for Namibia to hint at an upset but Italy’s extra skill and class eventually shone through as they ran out comfortable victors. Namibia took the lead just five minutes into the Pool B clash through scrum-half Stevens. Janco Venter gathered the loose ball after an Italian lineout went wrong. It was played down the line and winger Chad Plato broke through three tackles before feeding back inside for Stevens to run in under the posts. Italy drew level five minutes later through a penalty try after Namibia collapsed a scrum five metres out. The Azzurri went ahead after 25 minutes when Luca Morisi broke the defensive line and the ball was worked back inside for fly-half Tommaso Allan to run onto it at pace and crash over. Three quick tries either side of half-time effectively put the game to bed. A fine no-look pass from second-rower Federico Ruzza sent in Tito Tebaldi at the end of the first half, then Tommaso Benvenuti’s cross-field kick was picked up by Edoardo Padovani to slide in. Carlo Canna extended the lead by going over the line following a ruck. JC Greyling scored in the corner for Namibia but Italy finished well. Jake Polledri peeled off the back of the maul to crash over and Matteo Minozzi coasted in after Italy spread the ball wide from a lineout. Plato then burst clear for a late consolation for the battling Namibians, who have lost all 20 of their World Cup matches.
