In July this year the niche podcast Who? Weekly got a call from an unexpected listener. “Hi Who? Weekly, this is Lena Dunham calling you from Wales,” said Lena Dunham, calling from Wales. On the biweekly show, the hosts Lindsey Weber and Bobby Finger decode – with eager and delightful sass – the myriad dramas of wannabe celebrities (referred to as “Who?s”) and the tabloids who love them. And, on Tuesday episodes, listeners call the helpline – sometimes drunk, often stoned, occasionally hysterical – demanding an explanation of who some Instagram person is, for instance, or why their fake wedding is getting press. Dunham is too much of a real celebrity, or a “Them”, to be discussed on the podcast, but evidently not too famous to call in. She is “obsessed” with Who? Weekly, she told Weber and Finger, and wanted to hear more about the UK reality TV sensation Love Island. “Overnight, these incredible Who?s ... become these total Thems, and then get kicked off the show and transition back to Who?s!” Dunham enthused. She ended the call with a series of podcast in-jokes: “Good form, Bella Thorne! Scar-Jo Yummy Pop! Bye!” In just three years of recording Who? Weekly from their homes, editing it themselves and touring a live show, Weber and Finger now get about 400 calls a week. It’s a strange thing to have your highly specific D-list obsession resonate with so many others. It’s even stranger to have it resonate with Lena Dunham. “She did a perfect call!” Weber exclaims. “She did her full name – ‘Hi, it’s Lena Dunham’ – and I’m like, ‘You’re crazy, and I love it.’ AND she talked about a topic [Love Island] that is very close to my heart.” Listening to Weber and Finger chat in a Brooklyn cafe is not dissimilar to listening to their podcast, which is best summed up by its tagline: “Everything you need to know about the celebrities you don’t.” Close friends in real life, they talk fast, funny and often both at once, ramping each other up into coffee-spitting laughter or cutting the other down sharp and quick: “Bobby, NO. Don’t SAY that!” The people they poke at might be influencers, YouTubers, or stars of dud films and reality shows. As Weber said in the first episode, “they’re the people that want to be talked about the most” – which theoretically gives her and Finger carte blanche to let loose on them. Weber used to write for the pop culture site Vulture and Finger for Jezebel, but earlier this year they were making enough from the podcast’s ads and subscribers to quit full-time jobs and focus on its growth. Perhaps its success can partly be attributed to the hosts’ own insider status, as New York media-types who are only a few degrees of separation from the people they talk about. “I think Lena is one of those celebrities that we would get along with, because she’s also super obsessed with other celebrities,” Weber says. Another is the actor Busy Phillips, who in 2018 appeared as a rare guest on the show, and had no issues sharing what it was like being the least successful former cast member of Freaks and Geeks; and admitted to making more money in a year from sponsored content, or sponcon, than from acting. While Dunham is a “Them” in the show’s parlance, Phillips would be a “Who?” – and when the Orange Is the New Black star Lea DeLaria called the helpline in August asking to be classified, she was told she was a Who? too. “‘Who?/Them’ is not actually a value judgment – it’s literally just a categorisation,” Weber explains. “It’s totally out of love.” Today’s is one of my favorite Who’s There episodes in a while, and not only because Lea DeLaria called the hotline. https://t.co/k1Atryi95K The podcast deals not just with the antics of Who?s – the influencer scandals, public apology fails and manufactured beefs – but the desperate way those antics are covered by the tabloid industry, which is being rendered increasingly irrelevant thanks to social media. When someone can get millions of “fans” just for posting photos of themselves pretending to eat a burger, what even is a celebrity? And why do we need some magazine to tell us what they’re up to a week later? “So much of [the magazine] Us Weekly now is, like, Instagrams I saw three days ago,” Finger says. “And if you’ve already seen the Instagrams, you don’t need to see them again. Maybe you want to hear people talk about them like idiots instead. Sure, we can provide that!” The pair love Who?s including the actor Bella Thorne, who recently (allegedly) leaked her own schedule to the paparazzi; and Josh Gad, who appears in the coverage of every celebrity death by popping up on social media with an “RIP”. (“It’s a great tic to have,” Weber says, laughing). The US television hosts the Property Brothers provide plenty of fodder (“Two twins who did magic and now do house renovations? How could we not!”), and Australia’s Hannah Gadsby is a new fave too: “When you’re a Who? [Gadsby] and you’re known by a completely different name [Nanette], that’s a recipe for joy,” Finger says. The UK pop star Rita Ora, meanwhile, remains a Who? Weekly MVP, thanks to her ability to attract coverage for doing something as simple as wearing – or not wearing – or half-wearing? – jeans. The podcast has a regular segment called “What’s Rita Ora Up To”, where they check in on her headlines each week – and while she may be transitioning from a Who? to a Them, the hosts say it would be “fucked up” if they stopped following her. “She’s kind of a magical figure in that she attracts it, appreciates it, likes it, encourages it,” Weber says. Ora has been told about the segment, apparently. She doesn’t care. “Honestly, she’s too busy,” Finger says, shrugging. It’s impossible to talk about Who? Weekly without talking about its Facebook group. With 15,000 members and volunteer moderators, it has become its own world, populated by listeners, yes, but also by industry insiders, who weigh in with their own obsessions, deep dives and rumours. In an article on Refinery29, Amelia Harnish praised the group, whose members refer to themselves as Wholigans, for being “crucial to the survival of my sanity these past few years” – and for generating headlines in its own right. The 2017 doxxing of Sean Spicer’s Venmo account, for instance, was instigated by a Wholigan; and it was on Who? Weekly’s Facebook group that a superbly in-depth 29-page PowerPoint presentation first appeared, floating a theory – with legendary detail – that Lorde was the reason Dunham and Jack Antonoff split up in 2018. “There’s no greater way to find people you like than to start your own podcast and let them find you,” Weber says. But while the official group and its innumerable spin-offs are fertile ground for news tips, the pair try to stay out of it. “The drama makes me nervous,” Finger says. “And starting new gossip isn’t what we want to be doing. We’re about what’s already been covered.” In their analysis, he says, they try to strike a balance “between BuzzFeed Books niceness and Page Six snark”, but they cut things that go too far “all the time”: commentary on someone too young, for instance, or someone who might be on a downwards spiral. The pair have “no major regrets” about anything that’s made it to air: “And, fortunately, we’re still not big enough to the point that the celebrity will listen or care. That’s only happened twice.” One was the actor and writer Tavi Gevinson, who allegedly called the pair “mean” after an episode in which they discussed the deluxe apartment gifted to her as sponcon. “But it’s just one of our favourite Spons!” Weber says. “A New York apartment? Could that be more in our wheelhouse? I am literally obsessed with the fact that Tavi got paid to LIVE IN IT, you know?” The other came in 2016, after Finger questioned the chemistry of Martha Stewart and the Modern Family actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who appeared together on Stewart’s online cooking show. “You could tell Martha just did not like this guy,” he said on the podcast. The actor tweeted his rebuttal. @bobbyfinger Martha & I are actually friends. You'll have to rethink your reasoning. All other points are valid.😘 pic.twitter.com/qrxv3AlNxa “That’s, like, what I crave,” Weber says now, laughing. “Jesse Tyler Ferguson tweeting at Bobby that he and Martha Stewart are actually friends. It’s like, God bless you. Thank you for that. I love you. It’s perfect.” “And thank you,” Finger adds, “for the stream.”
