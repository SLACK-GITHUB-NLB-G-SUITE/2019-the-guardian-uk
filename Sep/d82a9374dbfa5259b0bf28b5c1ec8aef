The BBC is not planning to offer a permanent presenter role to David Gower, who is set to leave Sky at the end of his contract. The former England Test captain, who has been part of Sky’s cricket coverage for two decades, made a surprise appearance as a presenter of the sports news on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. He helmed the early morning sports bulletin, reading out the racing tips and made a quip about Brexit and the rain at Old Trafford where the fourth Ashes Test is taking place. It is understood Gower’s invitation was scheduled solely to coincide with the start of the Test and was more a case of “showing willing”, according to sources, rather than intended to indicate a more permanent arrangement. The 62-year-old confirmed in July he had not being offered a new contract by Sky and that the Ashes series will be his last as the channel’s cricket anchor.
