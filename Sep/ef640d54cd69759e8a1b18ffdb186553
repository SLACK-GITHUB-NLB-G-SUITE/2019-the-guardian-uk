Australia claimed victory in their opening T20 match against Sri Lanka at North Sydney Oval in a tighter than expected clash that saw blistering centuries scored by both teams. Sri Lanka mustered a national record 176-7 from their 20 overs, in response to Australia’s massive 217-4. Chamari Attapatu reached the boundary almost at will in the latter stages of her innings to finish on 113, hitting 12 fours and six sixes. But despite her stylish heroics, the result was rarely in doubt with Sri Lanka well behind the run-rate from the early stages of the chase. Megan Schutt (1-34) finally dismissed the opener in the penultimate over with a well-directed yorker breaching Athapaththu’s defences, ensuring the all-conquering Aussies opened their domestic summer in winning fashion. Earlier, Beth Mooney crunched her way to three figures, eventually hitting 113 in a 61-ball innings that included 20 boundaries. Australia’s batting barely missed a beat as Mooney and Ashleigh Gardner put on a 115-run stand for the third wicket. Gardner’s whirlwind 27-ball innings, included four sixes. Alyssa Healy got the Australians to a strong start with 43 off just 21 balls, although there was a rare failure for Australia’s leading run-getter Meg Lanning who managed just one before failing lbw.
