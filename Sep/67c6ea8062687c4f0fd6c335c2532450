After years of success, Juventus hope the thing that will take them to the next level is to bring in three Manchester United players, with the Serie A champions contemplating a triple swoop for David de Gea, Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic. Bruno Fernandes was interesting Manchesters City and United in the transfer window, the midfielder is now set to commit his future to Sporting. With all the talk of Christian Eriksen trying to leave for any club in Spain, no one noticed that Lucas Moura had the chance to join Barcelona over the summer but the Catalans could not pay Spurs the proposed £45m fee. Maybe he was the Brazilian forward with Paris Saint-Germain on his CV that the Catalans really wanted and the whole Neymar thing was a smokescreen. Speaking of Eriksen ... he could still be heading to La Liga in January as Atlético Madrid are interested in signing the Dane but it might be trickier to do the deal in real life than on Football Manager. West Ham finally looked to have a competent striker in Sébastian Haller but this has spurred them on to find another. They are supposedly plotting a move for Juventus big man Mario Mandzukic, who could replace the Andy Carroll sized hole in the squad but also be fit enough to play some games. There could be a Basque battle for Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta, as he’s attracting eyes from Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad, if the Premier League club ever decide to sell the Spain international. One man set to stay at Chelsea is Callum Hudson-Odoi who after delaying longer than Crossrail, looks set to sign a new five-year deal at Stamford Bridge. After Bolton avoided extinction they will mark the occasion by signing striker Joe Dodoo, who was recently released by Rangers.
