Australia’s Owen Wright has cemented his spot in the World Surf League tour top 10 with a third-place finish at the Freshwater Pro event in California. Wright backed up his win at last month’s Tahiti Pro with a solid display in Saturday’s (Sunday AEST) final at Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch in Lemoore. The 29-year-old Wright’s two-wave score of 17.33 matched championship leader Filipe Toledo but the Brazilian finished second due to a higher single-wave score of 9.63. Defending world champion Gabriel Medina made it a one-two for Brazil, winning the event with an unmatched 18.86 two-wave score including a near-perfect 9.93 on his first left-hand wave of the eight-man final. The result lifts Medina to the top of the tour standings, ahead of Toledo with Wright moving up one place to seventh. Wright remains the highest-ranked Australian with Julian Wilson’s fifth-place on the artificial waves at Lemoore moving him up two places to ninth. In the women’s competition, a brilliant final ride by American Lakey Peterson secured her a 9.33 and victory over France’s Johanne Defay. Peterson’s clutch ride gave her a two-wave score of 18.03 with Defay having to settle for second on 17.60. Australian pair Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons both had to settle for a share of fifth place after missing out on the four-woman final. Peterson’s fifth world championship tour event win took her above Fitzgibbons and Gilmore and into second on the championship ladder behind American Carissa Moore, who finished third. Fitzgibbons has slipped to third on the rankings while seven-time world champion Gilmore is fourth. The next event of the WSL tour is the Quiksilver and Roxy Pro events in France from October 3.
