The openers Chris Nash and Alex Hales fired Notts Outlaws to Vitality Blast Finals Day with a 10-wicket win against Middlesex at Trent Bridge. The hosts’ bold decision to tinker with their top order paid off as Nash, replacing Joe Clarke, and Hales led their side to victory with a 165-run stand. Set a victory target of 161, Outlaws raced to the finish line with 22 balls remaining with Nash making an unbeaten 74 and Hales, who won the match with his seventh six, on 83 not out. Both players were dropped by the shell-shocked visitors; Nash at long-on by Steven Finn on 31 and his partner on 47 by Toby Roland-Jones. Middlesex were put in and had to settle for 160 for eight on a fresh strip. Eoin Morgan made 53 from 31 balls, before becoming one of Harry Gurney’s two victims. Matt Carter, with two for 16, was the most economical member of the Outlaws’ attack. Morgan, England’s World Cup-winning captain, was given a warm and respectful welcome to the middle by the Nottingham public. The 32-year old combined with John Simpson to take the total to 66 for four at halfway. Morgan looked to get after Gurney in the 18th over, hitting him for two sixes – the second of which brought up his 50 – but the attempt for a third in a row fell short as Ben Duckett held his second catch of the innings. Luke Wood and Gurney delivered the final two overs at the expense of a trickle of singles, leaving Middlesex’s score within comfortable striking range of the Outlaws’ top order.
