Cara Delevingne has revealed that she was told by Harvey Weinstein to “get a beard” to cover up her sexuality in order to succeed in the film industry. In an interview with Net a Porter, Delevingne said that “one of the first things Harvey Weinstein ever said to me was, ‘You will never make it in this industry as a gay woman – get a beard.’” The term “beard” is traditionally used to describe someone who helps conceal another person’s sexual identity on social occasions. Delevingne, who describes herself as “gender fluid”, added she felt the industry has been resistant to her sexuality, saying: “In the beginning, I don’t think it helped.” Delevingne’s remarks echo recent comments by Kristen Stewart, who says she was told to not “go out holding your girlfriend’s hand in public” in order to win mainstream film roles. In 2017, Delevingne alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed her at a meeting, asking her to kiss another woman, and then trying to kiss her himself when she wanted to leave. In the same social media post, she said that Weinstein said that “if I was gay or decided to be with a woman especially in public that I’d never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood”. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Alongside her successful career as a model, Delevingne has appeared in a string of films including Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, Tulip Fever and London Fields.
