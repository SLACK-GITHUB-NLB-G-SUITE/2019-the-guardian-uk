From brightly patterned tiles to intricate mosaics, sometimes beauty is right under our feet. Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag. Featuring striking geometric designs, positive affirmations and colourful bricks, they reveal that attractive floors can appear in some pretty unlikely places – such as this one in Dallas/Fort Worth international airport. The craze started one night in a bar in Amsterdam when work friends Edith Beurskens, Josha Jansen and Pien van Wijmen discovered they had something in common: they all enjoyed sharing pictures of their feet on attractive floors on Instagram. They decided to create a dedicated account where they could share their own photos and re-gram beautiful floors, using the hashtag #ihavethisthingwithfloors. Instagrammers are instructed: “When feet meet nice floors, take a selfeet.” Five years later, more than 845,000 photos have been shared from cities from Hội An to Beirut to Miami. Some are featured on the team’s original account, often coupled with an inspirational or punny caption.Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.
