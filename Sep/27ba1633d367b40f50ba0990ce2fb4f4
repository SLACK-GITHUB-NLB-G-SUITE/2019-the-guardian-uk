It would be comforting to think that a story about the defence secretary endorsing mock executions in an interview 16 years ago (Report, 9 September) might be of merely historic interest. Surely no serving minister could believe it acceptable to support actions banned under the UN convention against torture. Sadly, Ben Wallace’s comments are in tune with a government agenda to undermine the absolute torture ban. His department is currently considering proposals which would give a 10-year expiry date for prosecution of crimes committed by British forces abroad, potentially including torture. For the UK to create impunity in this way would be offensive to torture survivors. Blocking justice for past crimes sets a dangerous precedent and must be avoided.Sonya SceatsChief executive, Freedom from Torture • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
