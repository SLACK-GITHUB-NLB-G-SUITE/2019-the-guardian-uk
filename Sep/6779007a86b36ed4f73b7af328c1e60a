Fans of the John Gosden/Frankie Dettori combination endured a frustrating Friday but Lord North (3.40) gives them every chance of a better Saturday at around 8-1 in the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket. A progressive three-year-old, like the horse that won this race last year for the same trainer and jockey, he looked well treated when runner-up on his handicap debut recently. That was his first run after a gelding operation and a break since May, suggesting Gosden may have had this target in mind for some time. The 33-1 about the doughty Baltic Baron has some each-way appeal. 1.50 Newmarket Kameko will be a warm order for this Royal Lodge but a value alternative may be Pyledriver, who surprised connections with a strong-finishing win at Haydock last time. The progressive colt has more to offer and his stamina could count for plenty here. 2.05 Haydock If racing goes ahead on soggy Merseyside, the mudlark Mitchum Swagger is the sort of horse you will need on your side. He was a Listed winner last year and this looks a good opening for him after a mid-season break. 2.25 Newmarket Another compliment was paid to Raffle Prize on Friday when Daahyeh, who chased her home in July, won the Rockfel. Her neck second in the Prix Morny reads very well in this company and the stable remains in fine form. Tropbeau perhaps needed more rain. 3.00 Newmarket A Middle Park of extraordinary depth provides a contest to savour, in which Siskin’s turn of foot may prove the deciding factor. From the Ger Lyons stable that won the Cheveley Park on this card some years ago, he was brave to win the Phoenix on unsuitably soft ground but should be more comfortable on this surface. Mums Tipple is a very short price for a horse that has never raced in Group company. Earthlight is classy but might be at the stage where another furlong is a good idea. 3.15 Haydock There was a lot to like about the way Came From The Dark won over this course and distance three weeks ago, when the going was also heavy. This is tougher but Ed Walker’s grey is going the right way.
