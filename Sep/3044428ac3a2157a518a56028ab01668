The pound hit its highest level in five weeks against the US dollar on Thursday as investors reacted to the diminishing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit following a string of government defeats. The pound reached $1.2353 on Thursday just before midday, its highest point since 29 July, in the wake of Wednesday’s vote in parliament to block a no-deal Brexit and Jo Johnson’s shock resignation from his brother’s government. The move represented a dramatic 3% turnaround from earlier in the week. Sterling plunged to a three-year low below $1.20 on Tuesday, as investors priced in heightened political uncertainty after Downing Street’s call for an election if rebel MPs blocked a no-deal Brexit. Against the euro, the pound hit €1.1171 on Thursday, the strongest since 26 July. Sterling remains one of the most sensitive barometers of the risks of a disruptive Brexit, which the vast majority of economists believe would be damaging to the British economy. David Page, a senior economist at AXA Investment Managers, said a delay to the scheduled departure date was the most likely outcome after Wednesday’s vote, and its subsequent rejection of Johnson’s calls for an election on 15 October. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has said he will only whip in favour of an election after legislation preventing a no-deal Brexit becomes law. Despite the recent recovery, sterling remains almost 7% lower than the day Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, took office, and 16% weaker than at the start of 23 June 2016, the day of the EU referendum. Richard Falkenhäll, a currency strategist at SEB, a Nordic bank, said Johnson’s defeats might only offer temporary relief to sterling. “We expect renewed weakness in the pound once the election is under way,” he said, “as the outcome will be impossible to predict, and could be anything from a leave parliament accepting a no-deal departure to a Labour majority with a completely different and left-oriented economic policy.”
