The Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka paid tribute to the influence of Freddie Ljungberg after producing a scintillating display in Thursday night’s 3-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Saka, who turned 18 on 5 September, was virtually unplayable on only his second senior start, setting up goals for Joe Willock and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and bending in a sublime strike of his own. It was a triumphant night in particular for Arsenal’s academy, where their former player Ljungberg – these days an assistant to Unai Emery – coached Saka and the 20-year-old Willock. “He’s been with me since I was 15 and seen me do amazing things, but he always tells me to stay humble and keep working hard because he really thinks I can be a top player,” Saka said. “He’s been a player before so he understands how I would feel. He’s played in my position and it’s just so good to have him there, an Arsenal legend giving me advice. There’s not much more I can ask for.” Ljungberg was seen giving Saka some hands-on coaching before the Europa League tie and during half-time. “He was teaching me some tactics but I can’t quite remember what he was saying because he does give me a lot of information,” Saka joked. “He’s been a big part in my progress.” Saka explained that Cristiano Ronaldo had been a rather more far-flung influence on his young career. “He is unique but I try to look at him and take the good things from his game and one of them is his mentality,” Saka said. “He’s always focused, always working and I try to do that as well.” On a day-to-day level, Saka sees plenty of inspiration at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground. There is a sense that the current vintage of young players, many promoted to the first-team setup by Ljungberg, are capable of thriving together for many years. “It’s good to have your mates around you,” Saka said. “They push you. When you’re down they pick you up, when they’re down I pick them up. It’s good to have them all around us.”
