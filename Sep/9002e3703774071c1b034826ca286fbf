A new Chinese app that lets users swap their faces with celebrities, sports stars or anyone else in a video clip racked up millions of downloads at the weekend but was swiftly criticised over privacy issues. The app’s surge in popularity and sudden backlash from some users highlights how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies raise concerns surrounding identity verification. Zao was uploaded to China’s iOS App Store on Friday and immediately went viral. According to a post from the app’s makers on China’s Weibo social media site, Zao’s servers nearly crashed because of the deluge of traffic. According to App Annie, a firm that tracks app downloads all over the world, Zao was the most downloaded free app in China’s iOS App Store as of 1 September. In case you haven't heard, #ZAO is a Chinese app which completely blew up since Friday. Best application of 'Deepfake'-style AI facial replacement I've ever seen. Here's an example of me as DiCaprio (generated in under 8 secs from that one photo in the thumbnail) 🤯 pic.twitter.com/1RpnJJ3wgT Users sign up for Zao with their phone number and upload images of their face, using photographs taken with their smartphone. They can then choose from a range of videos of celebrities on which to superimpose their face, and share the videos with their friends. In addition to Chinese celebrities, other famous faces on the app include Leonardo DiCaprio and Marilyn Monroe. Gu Shi, a 21-year-old student in Shanghai, downloaded Zao after seeing her friends post clips on their WeChat feeds. “I’ve never tried using Japanese makeup and hairstyles because it’s too complicated to do all by myself,” she said. “This app gave me a chance to try a totally different style from my normal life.” As the app went viral, some users complained that its privacy policy could endanger them. One section of the user agreement says consumers who upload their images agree to surrender the intellectual property rights to their face, and permit Zao to use their images for marketing purposes. Zao said on Weibo it would address those concerns. “We thoroughly understand the anxiety people have towards privacy concerns,” the company said. “We have received the questions you have sent us. We will correct the areas we have not considered and require some time.” Zao was published by Momo Inc, which was previously best known for a dating app that later transformed into a livestreaming service. The company listed on the New York stock exchange in 2014. Momo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
