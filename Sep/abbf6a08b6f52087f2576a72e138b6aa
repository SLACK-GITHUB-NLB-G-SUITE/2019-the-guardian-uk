The actor and comedian Kevin Hart has been injured in the crash of a vintage car in the hills above Malibu. A California highway patrol collision report said the 40-year-old Hart was a passenger in a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda that went off Mulholland Highway and rolled down an embankment around 12.45am on Sunday. The report said Hart and the driver, 28-year-old Jared Black, suffered “major back injuries” and were taken to hospitals. Another passenger, 31-year-old Rebecca Broxterman, only complained of pain. The highway patrol report said the car went out of control as it turned from a canyon road on to the highway. The report said the driver was not under the influence of alcohol. A representative for Hart didn’t immediately reply to messages. The crash was first reported by the website TMZ.
