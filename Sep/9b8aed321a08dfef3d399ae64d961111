The Tesla Model 3 has rapidly become the UK’s third most popular new car as sales of electric vehicles overall doubled in the past year. New owners registered 2,082 Tesla Model 3 cars in August, according to data published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The figures meant Model 3 registrations overtook popular cars including the Ford Focus, the Vauxhall Corsa and the Mercedes-Benz A-Class in August. Only the Ford Fiesta and the Volkswagen Golf sold more during the month. Pure electric vehicles remain the preserve of a tiny minority of British car owners, representing only 1.1% of all car sales this year. However, sales of battery electric vehicles have almost doubled year on year in the 12 months to August, rising from just over 9,000 in 2018 to 17,393 this year. The success of the Tesla pushed battery electric vehicle sales by 378% in August compared with the same month last year. Deliveries of the Model 3 began in late June. Tesla, the carmaker founded in the US by Elon Musk, has been a pioneer in electric vehicle production. Tesla’s Model 3 retails at between £36,490 and £50,000, making it the most affordable car from the marque but still significantly more expensive than the UK’s other most popular cars. However, other carmakers are starting to catch up as the pressure to move away from fossil fuels intensifies, suggesting that prices for electric cars could fall. Jaguar’s I-Pace sports utility vehicle won the world car of the year award this year and Nissan has had some success with its Leaf model, while BMW has high hopes for its new electric Mini. The Mini, priced in line with fossil fuel versions, will be delivered to customers in early 2020. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, described the take-up of electric vehicles as encouraging but said the “figures also show the scale of the challenge ahead” as the UK moves towards zero tailpipe carbon emissions. 1 Ford Fiesta – 3,978 registrations2 Volkswagen Golf – 3,4393 Tesla Model 3 – 2,0824 Ford Focus – 1,8865 Mercedes-Benz A-Class – 1,8806 Ford Kuga – 1,7707 Volkswagen T-Roc – 1,6858 Volkswagen Tiguan – 1,6329 Vauxhall Corsa – 1,59210 Ford Ecosport – 1,477 Source: SMMT
