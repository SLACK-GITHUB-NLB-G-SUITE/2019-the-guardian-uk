Australian residents who were injured or lost a family member in the Easter Sunday suicide bombings in Sri Lanka can apply to the federal government for compensation. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Sunday the eight suicide bombings on 21 April have been declared a terrorist act for the purpose of the Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment scheme. “The scheme ensures Australian victims of terrorist events overseas, such as the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, have access to financial support,” he said. “The declaration of these attacks means that Australian residents who were harmed or lost a close family member … may seek a one-off payment of up to $75,000.” The Sri Lankan bombings targeted churches and hotels. More than 253 people died and more than 485 were injured. “We condemn those responsible for the horrific terrorist attacks on innocents and have extended our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and injured, and to the government and people of Sri Lanka,” Dutton said. The government has also declared the 25 August 2007 attack in Hyderabad, India, a terrorist act for the purposes of the scheme. Two almost simultaneous bombings occurred at a restaurant and an amusement park in Hyderabad, killing 42 people and injuring more than 50. The declaration of these attacks brings the total number of overseas terrorist acts declared by the Australian government for the purposes of the scheme to 42.
