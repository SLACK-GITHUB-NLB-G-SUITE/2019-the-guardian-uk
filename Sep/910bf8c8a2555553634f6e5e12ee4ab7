I could not take the sentimental send-off David Cameron got from the House of Commons when he resigned, and said so at the time. History was immediately being rewritten when it came to this man who had just made the mistake of having an unnecessary referendum. Poor chap. Sorry, but this is just not the case. Cameron’s self-belief deluded others into thinking that he stood for something other than himself. He was ruthless, and his shininess hid the reality of what his ministers were doing: what his chancellor George Osborne, for instance, unleashed on ordinary people. The decimation of the public sector, the deliberate impoverishment of the already poor was a national disaster. It still is. But not according to one George Osborne, who reviewed his mate Cameron’s book in a newspaper he now edits. Osborne described the pair helplessly witnessing the referendum result – “an event that destroys our careers, wrecks our political project and (much more importantly) ends an era of political stability and rationality”. Their careers were not destroyed; they failed upwards. The national disaster had already happened and, in fact, fed into Brexit – the poisonous discourse whereby the poor are blamed for the sins of the rich was an ideological choice. Cameron and Osborne were finishing the Thatcherite policy of shrinking the state. Even the International Monetary Fund at the time warned about the repercussions of such austerity. This rewriting of the recent past – the pretence that everything was going fine until the Tories gave in to their headbangers – is wrong. Cameron’s one modernising move, equal marriage, cost nothing. That was the whole point. Osborne asks us to feel sorry for Cameron, who suffers for his innocent mistake. David is “distraught by what happened to the Britain he cared about”. So am I, but it’s the Britain in which we step over bodies in sleeping bags, the one that he is partly responsible for, that I care about.
