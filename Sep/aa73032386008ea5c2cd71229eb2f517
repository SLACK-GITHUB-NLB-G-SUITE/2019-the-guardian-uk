Mathieu van der Poel sprinted to win the eighth and final stage and wrap up his Tour of Britain victory in style. The 24-year-old Dutchman, the 2019 world cyclo-cross champion, edged his compatriot Cees Bol (Team Sunweb) and Matteo Trentin (Michelton-Scott) in a dramatic finish in the centre of Manchester. It marked the Corendon-Circus rider’s third stage win of this year’s Tour and confirmed his overall victory by 17 seconds over Trentin, with the Belgian Jasper De Buyst taking third. Van der Poel played it safe in a gruelling final stage and kept Trentin in his sights, with a series of breaks hauled back in by teams seeking to secure their own success in a sprint finish. 🏆 @mathieuvdpoel 🇳🇱 wins stage eight of the 2019 @OVOEnergy Tour of Britain 🇬🇧 in Manchester to claim the overall race victory!#OVOToBpic.twitter.com/OXiyv2wja2 Movistar’s Michal Golas was central to a pair of late breaks but they were brought back into the pack with 10km remaining as Trentin’s teammates did their best to manufacture a win for their man. Instead it was Bol who seized the initiative heading round the final bend. He looked to have done enough until Van der Poel came round him to sneak victory in a photo finish. “Coming into the [race] I didn’t really think that winning was possible, because of the time trial [on stage six] as I hadn’t done one in a really long time,” said Van der Poel. “After the time trial I started to believe I could win overall but today was harder than I thought it would be. “It wasn’t an easy day today. A lot of teams tried to attack us. I think I timed my jump perfectly so, yeah, I’m glad to win. I’m really happy with how I felt today, too.” Rory Townsend, who will be part of the Ireland squad at the forthcoming world championships in Yorkshire, won the sprinters’ competition, while Britain’s Jacob Scott held on to the king of the mountains jersey. “I don’t think I’ve done an eight-day stage race since the Tour of Britain two years ago,” he said. “I’d convinced myself that with working four days a week I’d probably have one really bad day but I don’t think I did.”
