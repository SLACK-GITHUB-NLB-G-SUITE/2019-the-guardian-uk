Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our small patio is looking rather sad and my husband is desperate to install some decking, which I fear will look good for a year or so, but then go downhill fast. Can you buy inexpensive, long-lived decking? Help me talk him out of it with a better solution. Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
