Alexandre Lacazette will be out until October as he recovers from an injury to his left ankle, leaving Arsenal short of attacking options during a spell that brings seven matches in three weeks. Arsenal confirmed that Lacazette had been playing through an “ongoing ankle issue” for weeks and would return next month. It is a significant blow given that the striker, who picked up a knock to the same ankle during the Emirates Cup match against Lyon in pre-season, has scored two goals in a strong start to the campaign. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is now Arsenal’s sole senior centre-forward and, with Europa League and Carabao Cup matches complicating their schedule after Sunday’s match at Watford, the 18-year-olds Gabriel Martinelli and Tyreece John-Jules could come into Unai Emery’s thoughts. In better news for Arsenal’s frontline, Emery confirmed the winger Nicolas Pépé would be fit to play at Vicarage Road after being held back from Ivory Coast’s squad during the international break. Emery said Pépé had been battling a “small problem” although claimed not to know the nature of the injury. Pépé, who impressed sporadically on his first home start against Tottenham a fortnight ago, will be expected to help fill any goalscoring void left by Lacazette but Emery pointed out the record signing from Lille will need time. “We need people to be patient with him and also help him to be comfortable, to know us, to know the opposition teams,” he said.
