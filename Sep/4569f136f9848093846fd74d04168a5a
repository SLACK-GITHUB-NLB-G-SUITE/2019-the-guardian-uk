In April 2017 I bought a 50cc AJS Modena scooter for my 16-year-old son. After eight months it wouldn’t start. The retailer ceased trading without fixing it. The manufacturer didn’t reply to my letter, and so I made a section 75 claim under the Consumer Credit Act to the Co-op Bank as I had paid using its credit card. But it rejected my claim as I had purchased it for my son whose name was on the log book.NJ, Belfast Banks will use any technicality not to pay section 75 claims. You bought the scooter and most would say you have a reasonable claim. But the Co-op won’t budge. If you’d bought a bicycle, for example, a log book would not have been a factor. The “customer-led ethical bank” says it’s treated you fairly. I disagree. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
