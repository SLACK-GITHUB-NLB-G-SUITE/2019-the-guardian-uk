Refugee, Mark-Anthony Turnage’s song cycle for tenor and chamber orchestra, received its first performance at the Enescu festival in Bucharest with Allan Clayton and the Britten Sinfonia, conducted by Andrew Gourlay. The following night they brought it to London, as the centrepiece of a programme devised by Turnage himself, which surrounded his new work with music by three composers whom he admires: Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten and Oliver Knussen. Poems from three centuries on the subject of displacement and rejection are brought together in Turnage’s cycle. A setting of Emily Dickinson’s These Strangers provides the brief introduction, delivered fortissimo by the tenor, before the main weight comes in Benjamin Zephaniah’s We Refugees and WH Auden’s Refugee Blues; there’s then a short, fierce orchestral interlude before the final poem, Refugees by Brian Bilson, in which the text is read (and in Turnage’s work sung) forwards and then backwards to express entirely different attitudes of intolerance and tolerance. The songs are predominantly lyrical, their orchestral accompaniments spiked with soprano saxophone and percussion, and with a distinct flavour of between-the-wars Weimar – Weill and Eisler – in the Auden setting. Clayton’s voice wrapped around all of them like a glove, with perfect weight and range of colour and dynamics, and he returned to end the evening with an equally masterly account of Britten’s Nocturne, in which the Britten Sinfonia’s principals distinguished themselves too. In between came Knussen’s Songs Without Words, enigmatic miniatures that seem far more substantial than their dimensions suggest; the concert had begun with Tippett’s Divertimento on Sellinger’s Round, though that sounded a bit congested in the generous Milton Court acoustic. • To be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 24 October.
