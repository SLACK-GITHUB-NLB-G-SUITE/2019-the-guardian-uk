Donyell Malen enjoyed a dream debut for the Netherlands after his goal helped give the Dutch their first win in Germany for almost 17 years. The 20-year-old PSV Eindhoven forward struck 11 minutes from time in Hamburg before Georginio Wijnaldum sealed a 4-2 victory which puts Ronald Koeman’s side right back in contention in Group C qualifying for next year’s European Championship. Not since November 2002 had Holland beaten their neighbours in their own back yard. That day they enjoyed a 3-1 success thanks to goals from Patrick Kluivert, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Serge Gnabry’s early goal gave Germany a half-time lead but Frenkie de Jong’s strike and a Jonathan Tah own goal turned the game on its head just before the midway point. A controversial penalty scored by Toni Kroos levelled things up before Malen quickly restored Holland’s lead and Wijnaldum made sure of victory in injury time. The win moves Koeman’s team to within three points of second-placed Germany with a game in hand. Belgium maintained their 100% record in Group I with a 4-0 win at San Marino. Michy Batshuayi scored twice, the first from the penalty spot, with Dries Mertens and Nacer Chadli on target in between. Croatia kept pace at the top of Group E thanks to a 4-0 victory in Slovakia thanks to goals from Nikola Vlasic, Ivan Perisic, Bruno Petkovic and Dejan Lovren. The Group G leaders, Poland, suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat in Slovenia, with Andraz Struna and Andraz Sporar on the scoresheet for the hosts. Austria moved to within three points of Poland with a 6-0 home thrashing of Latvia. Marko Arnautovic scored twice, once from the penalty spot, while Marcel Sabitzer, a Pavels Steinbors own goal, Konrad Laimer and Michael Gregoritsch ensured an easy win.
