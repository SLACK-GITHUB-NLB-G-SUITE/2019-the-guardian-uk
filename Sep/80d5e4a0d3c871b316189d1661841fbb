Pep Guardiola has strongly defended Bernardo Silva against accusations of racism following the midfielder’s controversial tweet to his Manchester City teammate Benjamin Mendy. Guardiola was asked for his opinion after his side opened their push for a third consecutive Carabao Cup with a 3-0 win at Preston. Silva posted pictures on social media on Sunday comparing Mendy, with whom he also played at Monaco, to the character on packets of Conguitos chocolates. The anti-discriminatory body Kick It Out called on the Football Association to take action, referring to the contents of the post as a racist stereotype. The governing body has written to City requesting their observations. Guardiola said: “I don’t know what is going to happen but they should put the focus on other issues because they don’t know which guy you are talking about. Bernardo is one of the most lovely people I have ever met in my life. “He speaks four or five languages – that is the best way to understand how open-minded he is – and one of his best friends is Mendy. He is like a brother for him. The image for the two is not about the colour of the skin. He took a picture of Benjamin when he was young and he related it to this cartoon, which was quite similar for the image … “If they [the FA] want to do that, to ask Bernardo, we’d be open to talk, but first to do that you have to know exactly which person are you talking about. “There are many situations with people, with white people and you look at a cartoon and [the face] is quite similar as your face and you put it in there, it is quite similar. “I think the response from Mendy was clear after that. They are joking all the time. Maybe it is what I said many times and my advice is not to use social media too much. If something happens it would be a mistake because Bernardo is an exceptional person.”
