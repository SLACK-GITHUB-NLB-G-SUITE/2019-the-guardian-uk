Women around the world are 27 times more likely to be harassed online than men. In Europe, 9 million girls have experienced some kind of online violence by the time they are 15 years old. In the UK, 21% of women have received threats of physical or sexual violence online. The basis of this abuse is often – though not exclusively – misogyny. Misogyny online fuels misogyny offline. Abusive comments online can lead to violent behaviour in real life. Nearly a third of respondents to a Women’s Aid survey said where threats had been made online from a partner or ex-partner, they were carried out. Along with physical abuse, misogyny online has a psychological impact. Half of girls aged 11-21 feel less able to share their views due to fear of online abuse, according to Girlguiding UK. The government wants to make Britain the safest place in the world to be online, yet in the online harms white paper, abuse towards women online is categorised as “harassment”, with no clear consequences, whereas similar abuse on the grounds of race, religion or sexuality would trigger legal protections. If we are to eradicate online harms, far greater emphasis in the government’s efforts should be directed to the protection and empowerment of the internet’s single largest victim group: women. That is why we back the campaign group Empower’s calls for the forthcoming codes of practice to include and address the issue of misogyny by name, in the same way as they would address the issue of racism by name. Violence against women and girls online is not harassment. Violence against women and girls online is violence.Ali Harris Chief executive, Equally OursAngela Smith MP IndependentAnne Novis ActivistLorely Burt Liberal Democrat, House of LordsRuth Lister Labour, House of LordsBarry Sheerman MP LabourCaroline Lucas MP GreenDaniel Zeichner MP LabourDarren Jones MP LabourDiana Johnson MP LabourFlo Clucas Chair, Liberal Democrat WomenGay Collins Ambassador, 30% ClubHannah Swirsky Campaigns officer, René CassinJoan Ryan MP Independent Group for ChangeJoe Levenson Director of communications and campaigns, Young Women’s TrustJonathan Harris House of Lords, LabourLuciana Berger MP Liberal DemocratsMandu Reid Leader, Women’s Equality PartyMaya Fryer WebRoots DemocracyPreet Gill MP LabourSarah Mann Director, Friends, Families and TravellersSiobhan Freegard Founder, Channel MumJacqui Smith Empower
