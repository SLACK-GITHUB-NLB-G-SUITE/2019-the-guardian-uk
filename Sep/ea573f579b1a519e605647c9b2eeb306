Un abrazo y muchas gracias! 💪 A post shared by  Diego Maradona (@maradona) on Sep 5, 2019 at 2:01pm PDT After he was banned from football, or had his “legs cut off” as he put it, for doping at the 1994 World Cup, he hung up his boots, temporarily, to coach Textil Mandiyú who were relegated and later Racing Club for the 1995 Clausura. He was unsuccessful and was back to wearing the No10 for Boca Juniors again the following season. Maradona most recently failed to take Dorados de Sinaloa into Mexico’s Liga MX from the second division. He later quit, citing health reasons. He coached Argentina at the 2010 World Cup but the team crashed out in the quarter-finals to Germany 4-0. His return to his homeland and its insatiable football media promises plenty of drama – a distraction from everyday life that some Argentinians will welcome. The country is experiencing economic and political turmoil as the peso continues to inflate at record levels heralding a depression with presidential elections looming.
