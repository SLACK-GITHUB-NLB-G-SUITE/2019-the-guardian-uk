Prof Lee Elliot Major pleads for Oxford to centralise its admissions (Oxbridge: Watchdog must now bare its teeth on admissions, 3 September). His characterisation of the current system is full of misconceptions. Faculties already set centrally agreed criteria for admissions, agree the framework by which these will be assessed, reallocate applications between colleges to ensure that individuals have the best chance of admission, and agree a faculty-wide ranking of candidates, as well as running many other aspects of the exercise. The central university runs the computer systems that coordinate the process, as well as organising compulsory training for those marking admissions tests and conducting interviews. While colleges remain the formal admitting bodies, the idea that admissions are run separately by each college is a myth. Moreover, in popular subjects, the process of selecting students already requires almost all members of the faculty to be involved. As nearly as possible, therefore, the system already runs in the manner that he seems to be calling for, except that candidates may express a college preference. The systems run by each faculty are designed to admit the top candidates across the university, respecting the preferences of students when it comes to college choice where possible. The college tutors who review applications and conduct interviews themselves constitute the faculty – there is no separate “department” to whom selection could be handed. They are one and the same.Nicholas ColeSenior research fellow, Pembroke College, Oxford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
