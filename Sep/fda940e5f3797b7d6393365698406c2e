Adele has filed for divorce from her husband Simon Konecki, following their separation in April. The filing was made in California, where she and Konecki have had a home since 2016, the year they married. When separating, a statement read that the pair are “committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always they ask for privacy.” Their child, Angelo, was born in 2012. The British singer has not directly commented on the split since, though did make reference to it in an Instagram post where she posted a meme of herself, featuring a tearful picture alongside a triumphant pose with the caption: “When you catch yourself in your feelings then you remember who you are.” In another post for her 31st birthday she wrote: “30 tried me so hard but I’m owning it and trying my hardest to lean in to it all.” That post suggested that her new album would be called 30, following the albums 19, 21, and 25. The latter, released in 2015, became the fastest-selling album of all time in the UK, and was the highest selling album in the world that year.
