Cats, it turns out, love humans more than we might think. Despite their contrary and aloof reputation, our feline friends form close emotional attachments to people who look after them – much like babies and dogs do. “Our study indicates that when cats live in a state of dependency with a human, the majority use humans as a source of comfort,” Dr Kristyn Bitale of Oregon State University, one of the researchers. Have you lived with a cat? If so we’d like to hear your stories about the moment you realised your cat really loved you. Did you return from a holiday to be slathered with affection? Perhaps you had a period of ill health and they didn’t leave your side. You can share your stories with us by filling in the form below. We will feature a selection of your submissions.
