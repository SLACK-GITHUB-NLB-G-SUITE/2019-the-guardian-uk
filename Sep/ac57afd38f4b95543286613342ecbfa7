100g, £1.50, asda.comMelts very easily. Smooth with quite caramelly notes. It’s thin. Quite nice; not too sweet. This is my favourite.★★★★ 180g, £3.98, tonyschocolonely.comVery chunky. It’s kind of biscuity – quite a crumbly texture. I think I prefer something thinner. Brown-sugary notes. Nice flavour, I just don’t like the thickness.★★★ 63g, £7, eu.marcolini.com Quite different to the rest. Like it’s got more cocoa... there’s a carob-y taste. I like the size of it. Very different texture in your mouth, more like a crumbly fudge. I don’t love it.★★ 85g, £1.60, waitrose.com Not as flavoursome as the others; a bit more delicate. It seems like it has more dairy, it’s very creamy. Kind of blah.★★ 70g, £5.95, rococochocolates.comSmooth creamy texture with subtle caramel cocoa tones and strong bursts of sea salt. I want more!★★★★★ 100g, £1.60, coop.co.ukSalt is the overriding flavour. I’m not sure I would be able to eat that much. The chocolate is quite good, it melts nicely in your mouth. Smooth, too.★★★ 180g, £3.98, tonyschocolonely.comIt’s really personal but I don’t like thick bars. It’s quite sweet; not that salty, more buttery. The caramel bits are nice – not a deep caramel taste, it’s quite light – but they get wedged in the back of your teeth which I’m not sure I like.★★★ 85g, £1.60, waitrose.com It has biscuity pieces that taste like ... cornflakes? The crunchy texture is very distracting. I don’t like this. ★ 150g, £2, marksandspencer.comI like that the skin is on the nuts. It’s got a good crunch. There is definitely more of a nutty flavour to this bar. I like this the most.★★★ 200g, £2, ocado.comIt tastes very sweet, and it’s definitely the milkiest-tasting. I think I can tell where this is from, because it’s a classic, isn’t it? It’s got its place.★★ 200g, £1, asda.comI got a massive almond, nice and crisp. But it’s quite a sweet chocolate and I imagine if you get a raisin it’s going to be extra, extra sweet.Quite a chunky chocolate. Creamy.★ 200g, £1.62, waitrose.com Raisin-heavy - there’s a lot of raisins and not so many nuts … I’m not so fond of this. Really sugary chocolate and the amount ofraisins makes it feel sweeter.★ 100g, £1.99, ocado.comClean, crisp. Well balanced, strong, lingering cocoa flavour with very light floral notes. I recognise this. I think it’s something I’ve eaten a lot before, dipped into fennel tea.★★★★★ 125g, £1.39, aldi.co.ukGood texture; it melts quite slowly. It’s a little cloying in my mouth but it has a nice aftertaste. It has a dark berry flavour and a flavour like the tannins in wine in wine. I like the intensity of this.★★★★ 100g, £1.40, morrisons.comThis is very fruity, there is a red berry flavour – initially at least. The texture is quite nice, smooth.★★★ 100g, £1.60, coop.co.ukQuite delicate. It’s crisp and it’s got a good bite to it. You could eat more of this as it’s not so intense. I can’t taste many underlying flavours.★★★ 100g, £1.50, asda.comHas a nice aftertaste, it feels refreshing, but not overly sweet. It’s bold, with a strong flavour, which is what I think I am looking for in a mint chocolate.★★★ 125g, £1.39, aldi.co.ukIt has a light mint flavour – I think if I’m going to eat mint chocolate, I’d rather taste it more. Really delicate.★★ 100g, £1.40, morrisons.comIt’s not very flavoursome but I like the thickness and the chocolate melts nicely. Tastes more spearminty.★★ 80g, £3.50, ocado.com It has crunchy brown-sugary pieces of mint, and is a thicker chocolate. It’s overwhelmed by the texture. I’m not sold. ★ 50g, £1.90, ocado.comSubtle vanilla notes. A nice balance of sweetness with a chalky, firm texture.★★★★ 85g, £1.60, waitrose.comIt tastes like there’s a bit of salt, which is good as it balances the sweetness. Melts nicely. Very sweet though – a caramelly salty flavour.★★★ 125g, £1.39, aldi.co.ukVery creamy. It has a familiar white chocolate flavour – more like a Milkybar.★★★ 100g, £2, marksandspencer.comI like the thinness. I can really taste the vanilla. Other than that, the only flavour is … sweet.★★ All products are blind-tested  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
