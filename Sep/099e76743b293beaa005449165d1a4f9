Your article (Falkland Islanders fear crashing out will end their fishing boom, 3 September) on the likely impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the Falklands provides yet another illustration of the broad and largely undiscussed effects of what the UK government is threatening. The Falklands and Gibraltar (a part of the EU) may be impacted most, but other UK overseas territories are also fearful of what comes next. All gain significant benefits from their association with the EU, particularly in relation to aid, free movement, and diplomatic access. Through EU support the territories in the Caribbean and Pacific have developed strong links with their neighbours; these too are now at risk. A recent House of Commons foreign affairs select committee report criticised the UK government for not doing enough to safeguard the interests of the territories; despite the fact that their populations are predominantly British. It is a bitter irony that those Conservative Brexiters who claim to be the strongest defenders of the territories are now precipitating a crisis that threatens their economic viability and security.Dr Peter CleggUniversity of the West of England • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
