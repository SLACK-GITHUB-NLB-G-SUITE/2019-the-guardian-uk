Jonjo O’Neill seems as puzzled as anyone else about the shortage in recent seasons of big-race winners from his yard, formerly a reliable source of contenders in Gold Cups and Grand Nationals. But there was a big presence of well-heeled people and good‑looking horses at his preseason owners’ day on Sunday and a lot of work has gone into recruiting both, testament to the fact that the 67-year-old trainer is in no mood to let his career wind down. “When you lose the good horses they leave a big hole and when the young horses don’t fill their place, you lapse for a year or two,” O’Neill said after parading around 40 of the 110 animals at his Gloucestershire base. “That’s the way it goes. There’s nothing you can do about that. It happens and it hits you before you realise. Then you’ve got to get off your backside and get some more horses.” The obvious alternative would be to drift towards retirement and, if he chose to put his feet up, no one would blame O’Neill, who has accumulated masses of goodwill in the 49 years since he first rode a winner. But he responds: “Oh Jesus, no chance. The two boys [the jockeys Jonjo Jr and AJ] are interested in it now, so that gives you a buzz. We’ve got a real good young team here now. Everybody is young and buzzing. Bar me and a couple of others, the rest of them are grasshoppers, flying around the place. “I won’t be giving up for a long time yet. The only way they’re going to be taking me out of here is in the box.” O’Neill estimates that his landlord, JP McManus, has just 15 horses in the yard at the moment and sadly these do not include the talented Palmers Hill, still sidelined by injury. Other heavy hitters such as Trevor Hemmings and Gay Smith are represented, part of the widest non-JP team of owners that O’Neill has had. They include Martin Tedham, chairman of the pharmaceutical packaging firm Wasdell Group, unveiled on Sunday as the new sponsor of O’Neill’s yard. Tedham went to £440,000 at an auction in April to buy the point to point winner Papa Tango Charly, who draws many admiring glances here. McManus was the underbidder.
