Peel and finely chop 4 cloves of garlic. Peel a 4cm knob of ginger and cut it into fine matchstick-sized shreds. Halve, seed and finely chop 4 small, hot, red chillies. Finely chop 4 spring onions, discarding any dark or tough shoots. Cut 250g of brown chestnut mushrooms into thick slices. Trim the roots from 150g of shimeji or other small mushrooms. Warm 6 tbsp of groundnut oil in a wok or thin frying pan. Add the sliced chestnut mushrooms and fry for a minute or two, turning them in the oil until golden. Add the chopped garlic, sticks of ginger, chopped chillies and spring onions and continue cooking, moving them round the pan to ensure even cooking. Stir in the small mushrooms and continue cooking for a minute or two. Mix together the juice of 3 large, ripe limes and 2 tbsp of fish sauce. Tear a handful of mint leaves and coriander leaves into shreds then add to the pan together with the lime and fish sauce mixture. Lastly, roughly chop 80g of cashew nuts and add to the pan. When all is hot and sizzling, divide between 2 plates or bowls. Enough for 2. Prepare all the aromatics – garlic, ginger, chillies and spring onions – before you start, then set aside until you need them. Once you start cooking you need to move quickly and there won’t be time to chop as you go along. In place of the mushrooms, use chicken breast and thigh meat, cut into 2cm pieces. Let them brown in the hot oil before introducing the other ingredients. Alternatively use scallops, removing them the moment they are opaque, returning them to the pan at the very end, with the fish sauce and herbs.
