The sacking of the chancellor’s special adviser, Sonia Khan, by the prime minister’s special adviser, Dominic Cummings, has turned Margaret Thatcher’s famous maxim, that “advisers advise and ministers decide”, on its head (Report, 31 August).

It took Thatcher 10 years to be “tripped up” by a minister–adviser disagreement; it has only taken Johnson five weeks.Steve GriffithsWatchet, Somerset • If Boris Johnson wants to deselect any Tory rebel MPs (Report, 2 September), surely progressive political parties should respond by allowing them to stand unopposed.Don MacdonaldLondon • I wish Boris Johnson would sort out Brexit soon, I can hardly move in my spare room without falling over boxes of tins and packets.Carolyn MartinFalmouth, Cornwall • In 1960s Uganda our neighbours had two Weimaraners with more sophisticated tastes than Simon Beeson’s border collie (Letters, 2 September).
