I am sorry that James Skelton, a former miner from Sedgefield, feels his Englishness has been eroded by EU membership (Labour’s love lost, 16 September). French-ness is obviously more robust. Here in southern France this summer, the locals have been as gloriously Gallic as ever despite 62 years in the community.

A simply cry of “Are you a foreigner?” before boarding a distressed vessel might do wonders for their image.Philip ArdaghTunbridge Wells, Kent • I’ve just heard on the wireless that an American has swum the Channel four times, back and forth in one go. Did the poor lady have to keep going while Priti Patel made up her mind whether she could come back in?Paul WrightKing’s Lynn, Norfolk • It’s good to see that the BBC is to streamline the selection of the UK’s Eurovision song (Report, 17 September).
