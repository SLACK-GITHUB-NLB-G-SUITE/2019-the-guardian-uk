1 September. The start of meteorological autumn. Another two hours of daylight lost in the next few weeks. Gardeners have seen it for some time. Seeds that raced to leaf and flower just weeks ago are sluggish now. All has noticeably slowed. Still time, though, to sow the last of the autumn leaves, mustards and mizunas, komatsuna, and spinach for spring. To sow, too, hardy lettuces, radishes, rocket, land cress. Plant garlic and autumn onion sets – we will, after some resistance, for want of watching something slowly grow. But first wait for the coming cooler weather. Even with an Indian summer, frost is possible sometime this month especially outside the south. So tidy and weed, take care of the compost and fork it over, water it if it’s dry. Harvest the last of the potatoes. Untie lingering tomato plants, remove lower leaves and lay flat. You may soon need to strip the last green toms to colour them on a windowsill, bag them with a banana. Similarly, with pumpkins and squash, remove some leaves to let light in and remember to keep up with the watering and feed. It’s likely the end of beans and courgettes and corn. Clear the space and pack poles away (I may try running up a few climbing nasturtiums, though of course I know it is late). There is still time for a few herbs to go in: chervil, coriander, perhaps parsley in a sheltered spot. It is a good time, too, to think about sowing green manure (I will come back to this soon in another column). Mostly gather together for an early autumn barbecue, share stories of successes and failures. Some will start the slow drift away from their plots, to return again in the spring. Time, too, to take stock and to give thanks – for family, garden friendships and food. Allan Jenkins’s Morning (4th Estate, £8.99) is out now. Order it for £7.91 from guardianbookshop.com
