Manchester City thrashed Lugano 7-1 in the first leg of their Champions League tie in Switzerland, after going in at the break level with their hosts. Nick Cushing’s side were eager to make amends for last season’s exit at this stage to Atlético Madrid, and dominated proceedings against the Swiss league runners-up at the Cornaredo Stadium. City took an early lead through Georgia Stanway before hitting the woodwork twice, but were left fearing another shock exit when Kaela Lee Dickerman equalised for Lugano just before the break. The hosts then missed a chance to take the lead, Sofia Pedrazzini failing to capitalise on an error from goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck. Just three minutes into the second half, the visitors regained the lead with Aoife Mannion slotting home from the penalty spot after Lee Geum-min had been fouled inside the area. Pauline Bremer then took centre stage, scoring twice in 12 minutes. The German forward finished with a clinical lob from Steph Houghton’s pass, before slotting home the fourth to end the tie as a contest. Lugano’s side features several US college players and the hosts inevitably tired in the latter stages, with City ruthless. Caroline Weir scored twice either side of a Janine Beckie effort, as the visitors made progress to the last 16 a formality. PSG also ran up a huge first-leg lead, beating Braga 7-0 in Portugal. Marie-Antoinette Katoto struck a hat-trick inside the first hour, with Formiga and Kadidiatou Diani also on target, before Canada’s Jordyn Huitema added two more in stoppage time. In Wednesday’s other first-leg ties, Olga García’s late winner earned Atlético Madrid victory at Serbian champions Spartak Subotica, while forward Laura Rus was sent off as Anderlecht drew with Kazakh side BIIK-Kazygurt.
