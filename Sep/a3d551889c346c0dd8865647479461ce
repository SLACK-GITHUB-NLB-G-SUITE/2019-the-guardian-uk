The Packers used the Bears’ usual trademark, a staunch defense, and just enough from Aaron Rodgers on Thursday night to kick off the NFL’s 100th season with a 10-3 victory over their archrivals. A lack of action in the preseason clearly damaged both offenses, and Rodgers at times looked uncomfortable in the attack designed by new coach Matt LaFleur. But he is a two-time league MVP, and he hit Jimmy Graham in the second quarter for the only touchdown of the game. From there, it was an aggressive defense that would have made Vince Lombardi proud in the latest edition of the NFL’s longest rivalry, which the Packers lead 98-95-6. Green Bay have won 16 of the last 19 regular-season meetings, and Rodgers is 17-5 against Chicago. Chicago’s defense was good, getting five sacks tying the most it has had against Rodgers. But the Bears could do little with the ball and the Packers had five sacks of Mitchell Trubisky, who never found his stride, and was sacked on Chicago’s final offensive play. Former Bears safety Adrian Amos picked off an end-zone pass into double coverage with 1:58 remaining, the only turnover of the contest. Mason Crosby made a 39-yard field goal in the final period for Green Bay, while defending NFC North champion Chicago got a 38-yarder from Eddy Pineiro. The NFL opted to go for a history-tinged opener rather than having the Super Bowl champions host the first game. New England will be at home to Pittsburgh on Sunday night, and it’s unlikely that game will be so dominated by D. Or by mistakes. Each team had 10 penalties, there was a total of 467 yards of only offense, and several drops. At one point, Chicago had three straight penalties to put them in a first-and-40. The Bears didn’t convert. “Three points is ridiculous,” coach Matt Nagy said. “Any Chicago Bears fan ... should be upset.”
