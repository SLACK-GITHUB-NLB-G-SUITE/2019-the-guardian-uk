Your article (Just 1% of passengers take one-fifth of all flights from England, 25 September) included a discussion on the option of applying a frequent flyer levy to help reduce emissions from aviation. It should have mentioned that precisely this proposal was adopted by the Liberal Democrats at our recent conference. As we said in our policy paper, Tackling the Climate Emergency, we would “reform air passenger duty for international flights to target the most frequent flyers. The duty level would be set at zero for the first flight and increase progressively for each subsequent flight in a given year … Everyone currently flying would still be able to afford to fly for occasional holidays, or for family reasons, but wealthy frequent flyers would pay more.” Any serious plan for reaching net-zero emissions has to tackle emissions from aviation. The omission of any mention of flying (and other sources) from Labour’s plans for reaching net zero by 2030 raises major question marks over their feasibility.Duncan BrackVice-chair, Liberal Democrats’ federal policy committee • Your report makes much of the growing contribution of the aviation industry to the climate crisis. What a shame, then, that so many Guardian Holidays – including river cruises, railway journeys and holidays in Scotland and the Isle of Man – involve at least one flight. It certainly makes them a no-no for my husband and me. We have never boarded a plane in the 49 years we’ve been married, but we’ve enjoyed some wonderful holidays and experiences.Joy WebbPenistone, Sheffield • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
