Tadej Pogacar won stage nine of the Vuelta a España as Colombian climber Nairo Quintana claimed the red jersey. UAE Team Emirates rider Pogacar battled through heavy rain and lightning storms to power to victory on the gruelling 94.4km route from Andorra La Vella to the summit of Cortals d’Encamp. The 20-year-old Slovenian finished 23 seconds ahead of new race leader Quintana, with compatriot Primoz Roglic third, Alejandro Valverde fourth and Marc Soler fifth. Movistar Team rider Quintana now tops the general classification for the first time since his overall victory in 2016, six seconds ahead of Roglic (Jumbo-Visma). The 29-year-old’s second-placed finish on Sunday came after his team-mate Soler, who was riding alone at the front with five kilometres to go, showed frustration having received team instructions to wait. Stage winner Pogacar told Eurosport 1: “I tried to follow the attacks and then on the ground sections I went full gas. “Today was a tricky stage, a lot of technical problems on the ground section, also a hailstorm. But today was an incredible ride.” After a rest day on Monday, the race resumes on Tuesday with stage 10’s 36.2km individual time trial from Jurançon to Pau.
