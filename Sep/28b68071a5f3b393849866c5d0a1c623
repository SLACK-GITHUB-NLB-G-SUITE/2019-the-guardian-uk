Neil Woodford has piled cash into FTSE 100 stocks after seeing the value of his flagship fund tumble 13% following its shock suspension in June. The beleaguered fund manager apologised to investors still trapped in the Woodford Equity Income Fund, and confirmed that their cash would likely stay gated until early December. Woodford has been using the suspension period to sell off stakes in unquoted stocks and unlisted companies that can be more difficult to get rid of. On Monday, Woodford Investment Management revealed that the bulk of the proceeds – about 84% – had been reinvested in London-listed blue chip stocks including Imperial Tobacco, BT and the British Airways owner, IAG. Woodford was forced to block investors from withdrawing their money from the equity income fund in June following a string of bad bets that prompted a surge in redemptions that he could not fulfil. Since then, the value of the suspended fund has tumbled 12.8%, underperforming the benchmark FTSE all-share index, which rose 4.3% over the same period. The fund manager blamed poor performance in recent weeks on its investment in Benevolent AI, a British healthcare company that uses artificial intelligence in drug development. A recent funding round that resulted in a $90m (£72m) injection from the Singapore investor Temasek valued the company at $1bn, half of what it was worth in April 2018. Woodford said the equity income fund would continue to charge trapped investors management fees during the suspension, despite calls by MPs and the Financial Conduct Authority to waive them. “We are very sorry for the continued suspension and understand the concern it will be causing investors,” Woodford said. “We remain fully committed to getting the fund into a position that delivers the best possible outcomes for our investors – for those who wish to withdraw their money from the fund when it reopens and for those who wish to stay.”
