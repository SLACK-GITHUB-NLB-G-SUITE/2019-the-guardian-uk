In December 2017 I cashed in some bitcoin and bought a £380 voucher for lastminute.com from Giftoff.com, which accepts digital currency payments.

After much to-ing and fro-ing I was eventually told the voucher had expired in December 2018. I have the printout in front of me and it clearly states 2020, but the company won’t budge.SF, by email Having seen the voucher, which as you say clearly states the 2020 expiry date, we were bemused by lastminute.com’s stance.
