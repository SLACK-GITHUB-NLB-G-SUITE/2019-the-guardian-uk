An urban climber known as the “French Spiderman” has been detained by German police after climbing a high-rise building in Frankfurt. Alain Robert took 20 minutes to scale the 153-metre (502-ft) Skyper building in the heart of Germany’s financial capital early on Saturday. After descending from the glass structure, Robert, 57, was escorted away by police. Robert has climbed many of the world’s tallest buildings, often without permission. In October 2018 he was arrested after scaling the 202-metre Salesforce Tower, one of London’s tallest buildings, without a rope or other safety equipment. Other landmarks tackled include Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Taiwan’s Taipei 101 and the Lloyds building in London.
