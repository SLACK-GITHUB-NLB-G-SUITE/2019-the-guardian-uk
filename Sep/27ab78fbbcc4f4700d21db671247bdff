It’s timely of Alex Clark to pre-empt any use of Shakespeare’s Henry V – you can see it coming – as evidence of how the selfhood of England and the English thrives on sticking it to the French (Shakespeare’s Henry V was more nuanced than we think, 2 September). We won the Battle of Agincourt, so there you go, Macron. But we didn’t; our victory was at a place called Azincourt. The now revamped museum Clark rightly approves of for its Anglo-myth busting is the Centre Historique Medieval Azincourt. Not Agincourt – that was, presumably, a medieval trooper’s mishearing (“What’s this place then, eh?”) of Azincourt. That we go on keeping up this mistake is no doubt a good sign of how we’ve always known better than our old frog-eating enemy.Prof Valentine CunninghamCorpus Christi College, Oxford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
