Note to anyone who contributes to Feast on Saturdays: please rethink the opening line in your recipes. Modern ovens needn’t be switched on when you start preparing the dish. Preparation times of 20-45 minutes over a switched-on oven simply waste energy. Instead, set your oven timer to five minutes before the end of preparation time to turn the oven on then. Bingo. You’ve saved another couple of minutes for the planet. Multiply that by the number of Guardian readers…Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire • What a hopeful, life-affirming article about Queen Mary University of London’s new “social change” degree course, where students attending are not motivated by potential earnings but by a desire to help fellow human beings within society (Report, 27 September). Come on, other UK universities, put on your own similar courses – they are obviously, and wondrously, in demand.Gayna WallsHythe, Kent • Why is Peter Bradshaw’s main G2 review called “film of the week” when it seems that every Friday he gives it fewer stars than other films? Maybe “review of the week” would be a better title.Annette DentKeighley, West Yorkshire • Can you explain why the freakishly beautiful Isle of Wight was chosen as a suitable place to send this minority of individuals who are allegedly responsible for part of the climate emergency that is facing us (These too-frequent flyers need their wings clipped, G2, 26 September)?Claire EzardCowes, Isle of Wight • Gaby Hinsliff says that “most voters are too busy cooking supper” to pay attention to politics (Journal, 27 September). Untrue. Most of us – the ones who aren’t posh – are too busy cooking our tea.Andy RileyLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
