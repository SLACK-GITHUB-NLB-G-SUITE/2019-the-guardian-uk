The lander module from India’s moon mission has been located on the lunar surface, the day after it lost contact with the space station, and efforts are underway to try to establish contact with it, the head of the nation’s space agency said. The cameras from the moon mission’s orbiter had located the lander, said K. Sivan, the chairman of the Indian Space and Research Organisation (ISRO) according to the Press Trust of India news agency. He added: “It must have been a hard landing.” ISRO officials could not be reached for comment. The space agency said it lost touch with the Vikram lunar lander on Saturday as it made its final approach to the moon’s south pole to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. A successful landing would have made India just the fourth country to land a vessel on the lunar surface, and only the third to operate a robotic rover there. The space agency said on Saturday the lander’s descent was normal until 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the lunar surface. The roughly $140m mission, known as Chandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008. The latest mission lifted off on 22 July from the Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, an island off the coast of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. After its launch, Chandrayaan-2 spent several weeks making its way toward the moon, ultimately entering lunar orbit on 20 August. The Vikram lander separated from the mission’s orbiter on Sept. 2 and began a series of braking maneuvers to lower its orbit and ready itself for landing. Only three nations — the United States, the former Soviet Union and China — have landed a spacecraft on the moon.
