The England wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor has announced her retirement from international cricket as she continues her battle with anxiety. The 30-year-old, who was the inaugural winner of the Guardian women’s cricketer of the year award in 2018, made her England debut in 2006, and has gone on to make 226 appearances, earning a reputation as one of the world’s finest players. In recent years, though, Taylor has missed a number of series at home and abroad as she manages her mental health, with the issue leading to her withdrawal from England’s squad midway through this summer’s Ashes. She has therefore decided to end an international career that started in August 2006 and comprised 10 Tests, 126 ODIs and 90 Twenty20s, the highlights of which include three Ashes series wins and World Cup triumphs in 2009 and 2017. Taylor said: “This has been a tough decision but I know it’s the right one, for me and for my health moving forward. I am extremely proud of my career. I leave with my head held high and with excitement for what my future holds and what my next chapter brings.” Taylor took an extended break from the game in 2016 but returned to play a pivotal part in England’s World Cup win the following year, amassing 396 runs at an average of 49.5. Nobody in the women’s game has affected more dismissals across all the formats than Taylor’s 232. She added: “Playing for England and getting to wear the shirt for so long has been a dream come true and I have been blessed with so many great moments. From making my debut in 2006, to Ashes wins, and of course the World Cup final at Lord’s, to name just a few. I’ve also been blessed with travelling the world and making lifelong friends. I can’t wait to see the heights that this team can reach.” Guardian sport and agencies
