I was pleased that the developer of the King’s Cross area will stop using facial recognition equipment (Report, 3 September). Of course, if Camden council had paid heed to the local objectors in 2004 and 2005, it would have adopted all the roads and public footpaths on the site and could have prevented the installation of this surveillance. By the way, the development is called King’s Cross Central, not King’s Cross, which is an area of London in two boroughs with a large and diverse population. It was a bit of a shock to read in your report that “King’s Cross is owned by a consortium…”Diana ShelleyLondon • Larry Elliott is right to call for the first phase of HS2 to start with connecting northern cities with each other rather than with London (Business view, 4 September), but it is essential that such a programme should include the north-east.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords • You do not need to be a “time traveller” to remember the polluted state of the Thames in the 1950s (A murky business: London’s ‘dark water’, 3 September).

On the rear doors was scrawled: “No prisoners left in this van overnight (Letters, 2 September).”Hilary MilburnWakefield, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
