Ginger Baker, the jazz and blues drummer who co-founded the rock band Cream, has been reported critically ill. A tweet posted from his official account reads: “The Baker family are sad to announce that Ginger is critically ill in hospital. Please keep him in your prayers tonight.” Baker, 80, has had a hugely varied career. Following two years together with Cream from 1966 to 1968, he and Eric Clapton formed Blind Faith, before Baker moved to Lagos and played with Fela Kuti. He has since spent time in cosmic rock band Hawkwind, John Lydon’s post-punk group Public Image Ltd, and in groups with jazz musicians including Charlie Haden and Bill Frisell. A documentary about his life, Beware of Mr Baker, was made in 2012. Baker’s health has deteriorated in recent years. In 2013 he told Rolling Stone that he was suffering from “extremely painful” osteoarthritis, and also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition. In 2016 he underwent open heart surgery and suffered a bad fall.
