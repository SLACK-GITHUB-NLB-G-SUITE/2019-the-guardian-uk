Lewis Hamilton’s unrelenting march to a sixth world championship has been given another boost after it was revealed Max Verstappen will start Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix from the back of the field. Verstappen is Hamilton’s closest non-Mercedes challenger for the title, 87 points adrift of the Briton. But just days after he crashed out on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix, it emerged that an engine penalty will demote the Dutchman down the grid at Monza. Red Bull’s engine supplier, Honda, has introduced a new engine for the 14th race of the campaign, and Verstappen’s former team-mate, Pierre Gasly, now racing for the junior team, Toro Rosso, will also be penalised for taking on the revised power unit. Hamilton is 65 points clear of his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas with eight grands prix remaining. Like Bottas, Verstappen has won twice this season. Charles Leclerc registered Ferrari’s first win of the campaign in Belgium last time out and they are expected to fare well in front of their home supporters.
