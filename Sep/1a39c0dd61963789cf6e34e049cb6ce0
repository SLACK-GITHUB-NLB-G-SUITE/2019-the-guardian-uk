In your report (Outstanding schools to lose exemption from Ofsted inspections, 1 September), Gavin Williamson claims he will leave no stone unturned in his drive to deliver great education for all children. Most school leaders and teachers will welcome this change for outstanding schools. Many such schools retain judgments made though a previous inspection framework in a very different educational landscape. However, it is important that outstanding schools are treated fairly. Under current arrangements, good schools receive a section 8 inspection in the first instance. This type of inspection cannot change the grade. Inspectors must explain why a grade change is needed and then allow the school 18 months to rectify any concerns before a full section 5 inspection. Outstanding schools must also be given this opportunity. The prospect of a grade change based on a single two-day inspection adds a huge amount of pressure for school leaders: 31% of headteachers who started in 2013 left the profession within three years. As a headteacher who has experienced a two-day inspection resulting in a “requires improvement” grade, I am sharply aware of how damaging it can be to the entire community. If Gavin Williamson is serious about delivering great education for all, he will work to ensure that Ofsted is a supportive process for schools rather than a system that contributes to the appalling waste of leadership talent we have seen in recent years.Rachel HornseyHeadteacher, Sutton Courtenay C of E primary school, Oxfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
