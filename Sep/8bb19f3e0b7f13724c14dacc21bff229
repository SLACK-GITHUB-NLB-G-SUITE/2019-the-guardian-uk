We’re in an era of “bring-backery” – blue passports are on the way and grammar schools would be if Theresa May had got her way. Any day now a politician is bound to call for the return of military conscription of our youths into national service. David Cameron was trying to get there with his National Citizens Service, before events, as they say, got in the way. Lots of countries still do this, especially if they’re near to Russia and its tendency to annex bits of other states. That’s not the issue for the UK, but politicians like the idea of military service knocking our wayward teenagers into shape, physically and otherwise. So is military conscription what 21st-century Britain needs to get discipline up and crime down? No, says an Economic Journal study of conscription in Sweden. Indeed, it has the exact opposite effect, with military service significantly increasing the chances of young men committing crime afterwards – convictions go up by 32%. The effect is driven by young men from disadvantaged groups or who had criminal histories. In part that is because military service means they are less likely to get established in jobs. In fact, conscription (even of the Swedish variety) widened inequality – reducing earnings and employment for those from disadvantaged groups while increasing incomes for those from more wealthy backgrounds. So there’s a lot more our politicians can do to help the youth of today – from providing better job or housing security to doing something about climate change. If any of them veer off track and start banging on about national service, consider it your national duty to put them straight. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.
