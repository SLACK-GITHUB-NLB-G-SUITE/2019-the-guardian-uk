Your article (Prevent review branded ‘superficial’ as past decisions overlooked, 16 September) was founded on a misunderstanding of the terms of reference of my independent review of Prevent. As I have made very clear, it is an evidence-based review with nothing off the table. In order to meet that requirement, I shall examine as much lived experience of Prevent as will be described to me. In this review, as in all others, the past will inform the future. What I will not be doing is passing judgment on specific past cases, nor on past policies replaced in the years since Prevent was first devised. I hope that the responses to my call for evidence (soon to be issued) will include real examples of the full range of experience and practice of Prevent.Alex CarlileIndependent reviewer of Prevent
