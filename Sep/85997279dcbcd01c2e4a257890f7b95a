A late equaliser from Burnley’s Jeff Hendrick earned his side a 1-1 draw as Brighton’s winless streak at the Amex Stadium continued. After a goalless first half Neal Maupay broke the deadlock, striking a superb volley from the edge of the box. The Seagulls looked to be heading towards victory before the ball fell to Hendrick outside the penalty area and he sent a powerful drive past Mathew Ryan. Brighton have not won at home in the Premier League since their 1-0 victory over Huddersfield on 2 March. They have now lost five and drawn three of their last eight games there, leaking 17 goals while scoring only four as Graham Potter’s wait for a first home win goes on. “It was frustrating. I feel for the players because they put a lot into the game,” said Potter. “For the first 20 minutes Burnley were the better team but then we grew into it. It would have been nice to hang on but that’s the Premier League. One thing can hurt you and that’s what happened.” The early momentum went in favour of the visitors, and the Clarets came close to taking the lead when a Dwight McNeil cross was almost turned into his own net by Dan Burn after Adam Webster failed to clear the low ball. In their first clear opening of the game Brighton worked the ball through midfield to Burn but Maupay failed to control his pass. Before half-time Solly March and Glenn Murray both tested Nick Pope in Burnley’s goal. The Seagulls started the second half much as they finished the first and were rewarded in the 51st minute, when Maupay volleyed home a March cross to score his first home goal. Then Davy Pröpper sent a header narrowly over the bar as his side looked to wrap up the points. Brighton kept the intensity up, putting pressure on the Burnley defence to try to score a second, with the substitute Aaron Connolly missing one of the better chances in the 89th minute. Against the run of play, however, the substitute Hendrick’s fine stoppage-time strike grabbed Burnley a point.
