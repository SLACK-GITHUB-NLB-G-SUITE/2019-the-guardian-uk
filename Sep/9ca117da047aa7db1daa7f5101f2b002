Dominic Cummings is an intriguing individual. His supposed intelligence (The myth of Cummings’ invincibility is crumbling, 5 September) seems to function for destructive purposes only and utilise well-rehearsed formulas. What are his aims? He also seems to hate the Tory party – he said in 2017 that Conservative MPs largely do not care about poorer people or the NHS – and to have the same feelings about the UK. Could he be using power-blinded Tories, particularly Boris Johnson, as tools to destroy both the Tories and the country?Margaret MartlewSheffield • We seem to be in a new Boris in Rumsfeldland situation. We have the known unknowns: which Tory MPs will vote against the government? But lurking in the background is the great unknown unknown: what new monstrosity will leap fully formed from the head of Dominic Cummings and slink across Downing Street to “entertain” the rightwing media? Jabberwocky, anyone?David SpilsburyBirmingham • Your article (Protesters’ cacophony takes the mic, 4 September) refers to the “largely inexplicable presence of a man with a glockenspiel playing the Imperial March from Star Wars”. Surely it is obvious that he is a supporter of the Rebel Alliance.Catherine BillamHavant, Hampshire • Question time is rightly named.

Can we expect some fraternal anecdotes from ancient history – Romulus and Remus, Cain and Abel?John BaileySt Albans, Hertfordshire • Et tu, Jo?William BullinBexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex
