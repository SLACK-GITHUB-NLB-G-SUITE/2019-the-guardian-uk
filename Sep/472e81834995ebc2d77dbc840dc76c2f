The Grammy award-winning songwriter LaShawn Daniels has been killed in a car crash in South Carolina at the age of 41, his wife said. Tributes are being been paid to the songwriter, who has written tracks for artists including Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson. Daniels won the Grammy for best R&B song in 2001 for Destiny’s Child’s hit single Say My Name, and he was nominated again in the same category in 2014 for Tamar Braxton’s Love and War. Other songwriting credits include Whitney Houston’s It’s Not Right But It’s Okay, Jackson’s You Rock My World and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé’s Telephone. Writing on Instagram, his wife, April, said: “It is with deep and profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved husband, father, family member and friend LaShawn Daniels, who was the victim of a fatal car accident in South Carolina. “A Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter, Daniels was a man of extraordinary faith and a pillar in our family. We would like to express our sincere appreciation for the continuous outpouring of love and sympathy.” The singer Kehlani was among those to pay tribute and tweeted: “Your legacy will never be forgotten!” Dawn Richard, who was in the groups Danity Kane and Dirty Money, said: “Yooooo I’m lost. LaShawn Daniels died?!!!! I’m stuck. This man took my vocal ability to new levels while working in Dirty Money. One of the funniest people with the best heart. A rare talent and a beautiful soul.” She added: “God bless his family and friends. I send my prayers to them. Stay strong.
