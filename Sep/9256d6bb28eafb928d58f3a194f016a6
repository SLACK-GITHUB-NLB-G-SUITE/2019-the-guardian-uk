The White House just offered a painful reminder to always double-check the recipients before hitting “send” on that office email. Shortly after the release of an explosive memo showing Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the administration appeared to accidentally send its talking points on the scandal to House Democrats. The talking points encouraged the president’s political allies to argue that there was no direct quid pro quo conveyed in the memo and that the whistleblower complaint was handled “by the book”. Here are the White House talking points on the Ukraine call. It’s a master class in straw man arguments. pic.twitter.com/Dugxee7seS “The case just shows another example of the ‘Deep State’, the media, and the Democrats in Congress damaging our national security by leaking confidential information,” they go on to say. After realizing the error, the White House sent another email to House Democrats, this time requesting to “recall” the original message. Here's a screenshot of the White House asking House Democrats to please disregard the talking points on Trump/Ukraine they just emailed them pic.twitter.com/55HgOESWyL However, it was too late, and shortly after the mistake was made screenshots of the talking points quickly spread on social media, catching the interest of many, including Bernie Sanders: The White House sent us their talking points around President Trump’s Ukraine call.For some strange reason, they forgot to mention that Mr. Trump said, “I would like you to do us a favor though” after Zelensky brought up military aid. pic.twitter.com/60PMZ6aKcv I would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump’s favor. However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth. But thanks though. While the Democratic party is yet to officially confirm whether they disregarded the email or not, the evidence suggests that it may now be too late.
