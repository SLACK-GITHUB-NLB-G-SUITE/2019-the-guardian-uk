Frozen in mid-air and silhouetted against the distant floodlighting at White Hart Lane, this image captures Tottenham goalkeeper John Hollowbread jumping to keep warm during a third round FA Cup match against Chelsea in January 1964. Spurs were a powerhouse in the sixties: they won the double in 1961 – with Hollowbread, primarily the club’s reserve goalkeeper, making one appearance that season – as well as the FA Cup again in 1962 and 1967 and the Uefa Cup Winners’ Cup in 1963. White Hart Lane was demolished in recent years to make way for a new multi-million pound stadium, but this ethereal image captures the old ground in its pomp. The packed “shelf side”, comprising twin layers of terracing, housed close to 20,000 Spurs fans and produced an intimidating wall of noise. This historical photograph is one of the most recognisable frames by the renowned sports photographer Gerry Cranham.
