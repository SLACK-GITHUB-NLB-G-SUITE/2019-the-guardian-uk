Chris Froome is back in hospital after accidentally cutting his thumb with a kitchen knife – the latest injury in a terrible year for the Briton. The four-times Tour de France winner said on Twitter that he had surgery on Friday to put the tendon back together in his left hand. Froome posted a picture of himself with his arm in a sling, sitting upright in a hospital bed. “Stupidly cut my thumb with a kitchen knife and had to have surgery to put the tendon back together last night. Stuck giving a thumbs up for a couple of weeks. This is not my year. Can’t wait for 2020.” Stupidly cut my thumb with a kitchen knife and had to have surgery to put the tendon back together last night. Stuck giving a thumbs up for a couple of weeks 👍😂 This is not my year 🙈 Can’t wait for 2020🤞 pic.twitter.com/BKzLgho82R It is the second time this year Froome has been in hospital. In July, he was in intensive care after crashing at the Critérium du Dauphiné, suffering numerous fractures and losing four pints of blood. The injuries caused him to miss the Tour de France. Froome only returned to riding a week ago after a 10-week spell of rehabilitation, undertaking some short track sessions in Nice. Richard Carapaz, the Giro d’Italia winner and future Team Ineos cyclist, has been forced to withdraw from the 2019 Tour of Britain after failing to receive his visa in time. The Ecuadorian had been set to feature for Movistar in the race, which began in Glasgow on Saturday. Instead, Héctor Carretero replaces the 26-year-old, who will join Britain’s Ineos team next season. “Sadly, and despite the Movistar team following all procedures, Richard Carapaz’s visa for the Tour of Britain has not been granted in time for him to travel,” Movistar said in a statement on Twitter.
