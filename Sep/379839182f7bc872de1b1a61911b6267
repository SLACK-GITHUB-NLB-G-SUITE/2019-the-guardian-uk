How am I supposed to answer that? It’s like asking about your favourite kid, or the best ice-cream, or naming one good book … ugh, Michelle Wolf in Melbourne. SNL’s The Day Beyoncé Turned Black. Perfection. The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾. It was the funniest book I’d read until I realised I was probably Adrian. The Heat. “Was he a hearing man?” is worth a pause to breathe every time. My girlfriend, [comedian] Sarah Keyworth. I know I’m biased but I don’t even mean as a standup. Just day to day, she’s hilarious. “I like your body.” I’ve never seen a room turn on a man faster, which is weird because I’ve had way worse things said to me. On reflection, anything I ever made on Weight Watchers. I’d try so hard to pretend it was filling. I was hungreeeee. I know what you want me to say but I won’t. Squillion. Butt. There’s too many to choose from but London Hughes on ice-cream and the “dick brain” is the last thing to make me cry with laughter. Catherine Bohart is touring, 30 September to 27 March
