Several personal items related to 1930s Texas outlaw Clyde Barrow have sold at a Boston auction for nearly $186,000. RR Auction officials say the Bulova watch that Barrow wore when he and Bonnie Parker were killed in 1934 sold on Saturday for $112,500. Parker and Barrow, who were immortalised in a 1967 film starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, were fatally shot by officers in Louisiana. The auction house’s executive vice president, Bobby Livingston, said a sawed-off shotgun that was in the possession of the Barrow gang in 1933 sold for $68,750. The weapon was confiscated after a shootout in Joplin, Missouri, left two lawmen dead. A draft of a Dallas police “wanted” poster for Barrow sold for $4,375. All of the buyers wished to remain anonymous. Bidding for a poetry book written by Parker reached about $25,000 before the consigner withdrew the lot.
