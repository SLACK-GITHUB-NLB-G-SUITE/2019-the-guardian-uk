I wish Jeremy Paxman’s campaign to make littering unacceptable every success (Paxman lays out proposals to stop Britain being ‘nation of litter louts’, 12 September). But there is a simpler way of solving the problem. If everyone who is able picked up just one piece of litter, as I do despite my geriatric knees which make bending down difficult, the streets would soon be clean. And the litter louts might get the message and mend their ways without the need for coercive measures such as numberplate recognition.Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex • I was interested to read that the Ig Nobel peace prize (Report, 13 September) was won by the international team that helped map out which parts of the body are most pleasurable to scratch. As the ankles, back and forearms ranked highest, I can only assume the researches were men (or women) who have never worn a bra.Michelle WebbHuddersfield, West Yorkshire • Stephen Rafferty writes: “Should this government lose in the forthcoming supreme court hearing it could appeal to the European court of justice” (Letters, 13 September). Although amusingly ironic, it is sadly untrue. Prorogation is a matter of domestic UK law. The ECJ (now the CJEU) only deals with issues of EU law.Robert AndersonLondon • Perhaps the crew at Starbucks didn’t want Ishmael on board as they knew it hadn’t turned out well last time he signed on (Letters, 13 September).Maggie JonesLondon • Perhaps Geoffrey Boycott will reflect, although he probably won’t, that the continued controversy over his dismissal of his domestic abuse conviction (Report, 14 September) probably kept Jofra Archer’s superb 6-62 at the Oval on Friday off the front page.Keith FlettLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
