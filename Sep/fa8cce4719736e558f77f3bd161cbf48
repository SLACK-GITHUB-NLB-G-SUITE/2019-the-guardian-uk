As international development academics and practitioners we are dismayed that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) intends to give its Goalkeepers Global Goals award to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on 24 September despite widespread global condemnation (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under fire over award for Narendra Modi, theguardian.com, 12 September). We recognise the considerable efforts made by the Indian government in tackling India’s sanitation crisis. Yet while Modi has brought the issue into mainstream political discourse, evidence suggests there remains a massive gap between the rhetoric and reality of the achievement of universal sanitation under his watch. Open defecation still prevails, alongside problems concerning sustainability and equity, especially for sanitation workers, and rights-based access. But what is most worrying is Modi’s human rights record and divisive politics, which prevent the realisation of the global goals that BMGF promotes. During his time as Gujarat chief minister and India’s prime minister, inflammatory hate speech, vigilante nationalism and violent acts against Christians, Muslims and women have been widespread. Freedom of speech and the right to dissent is under fire. Activists and critics have been jailed, killed and accused of being anti-national. Although imperfections exist in any democracy, the attitude of leaders is crucial when faced with such events. Mr Modi has generally reacted with either silence or a delayed and weak response. More recently, the Modi government’s repressive communication blockade and militarised actions in Kashmir and the crisis of detention camps that is unfolding due to the national register of citizens in Assam have undermined democratic process, and the health, security and rights of Indian citizens in these states. The BMGF award, along with the Seoul peace prize and UNEP’s Champions of Earth prize, serves to legitimise and embolden Modi and his supporters to intensify their divisive politics in a way that is in complete contradiction with the spirit and soul of sustainable, equitable and fair development.Prof Lyla Mehta Institute of Development Studies, UKDr Kamal Kar Honorary associate, Institute of Development Studies, UK and Community-Led Total Sanitation FoundationDr Shilpi Srivastava Institute of Development Studies, UKMr Deepak Sanan Sanitation activist, IndiaShibaji Bose Independent media consultant, IndiaDr Arnab Acharya Economics and statistical consultant, USAProf Vinita Damodaran University of Sussex, UKDr Anuradha Joshi Institute of Development Studies, UKProf Sanjay Reddy New School for Social Research, USA Dr Deepta Chopra Institute of Development Studies, UKDr Pauline Oosterhoff Institute of Development Studies, UKDr Subir Sinha School of Oriental and African Studies, UKDr Prarit Agarwal Department of physics and astronomy, Seoul National University, South KoreaProf Ian Bryceson Norwegian University of Life Sciences, NorwayDr Dolf te Lintelo Institute of Development Studies, UKProf Ben Rogaly University of Sussex, UKDr Gavin Collins National University of Ireland Galway, IrelandDr Lars Otto Naess Institute of Development Studies, UKDr Synne Movik Norwegian University of Life Sciences, NorwayDr Suchi Pande Research scholar, USAProf Emeritus Bill Derman Norwegian University of the Life SciencesDr Nicholas Nisbett Institute of Development Studies, UKProf Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt The Australian National UniversityDr Rosemary Collard Simon Fraser University, CanadaProf Ian Scoones IDS, University of Sussex, UKDr. Rohan D’Souza Kyoto University, JapanDr Syed Abbas Institute of Development Studies, UKSeema Kulkarni Feminist, water and sanitation advocate, IndiaDr James Ebdon University of Brighton, UKDr Pragya Srivatsava University of Pennsylvania, USAProf Khalid Nadvi Global Development Institute, University of Manchester, UKProf Bridget Byrne University of Manchester, UKDr Vera Mehta Senior advisor, Intergovernmental consultations, New York, USProf Sanae Ito Nagoya University, JapanDr Amrita Saha Institute of Development Studies, UKShruti Ajit Researcher, IndiaDr Andrés Hueso Sanitation specialist, UK • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
