I was disappointed to read that rape convictions are plummeting but sadly not at all surprised (Report, 13 September). While awareness of the crime has never been higher and the training of police officers is better than it’s ever been, victims are being failed. And that’s down to a couple of different issues. During the course of my work I’ve spoken to many police officers who tell me they have never received more reports of rape and other serious sexual assaults but struggle to process these allegations as quickly as they would like because of a lack of resources. They find the same issue when they hand them to the Crown Prosecution Service, where cuts in funding mean there is also a lack of resources to properly investigate and charge suspects. Another issue that could be to blame is the new policy of asking victims of crime – including rape complainants – to hand over their phones for evidence. This “digital strip search” asks for permission to view data including messages, photographs, emails and social media accounts, with prosecutions sometimes not going ahead if victims do not comply. With officers more capable than ever of supporting victims of this appalling crime, it’s worrying that a lack of funding is causing conviction rates to come down rather than go up. This could lead to a situation where rape is, in effect, decriminalised in all but name if those who are brave enough to report offences fail to see justice.Kim HarrisonPrincipal lawyer and head of operations – abuse, Slater and Gordon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
