Pop duo the Veronicas have disputed the account of their removal from a Sydney plane over an “incredibly intimidating and confusing” cabin baggage dispute, and are taking legal action. Sisters Jessica and Lisa Origliasso were asked to leave Qantas QF516, which was bound for Brisbane on Sunday morning, amid an argument with cabin crew. Qantas said two passengers refused to follow the cabin crew’s instructions and were “offloaded” before the plane took off. The Australian federal police said officers came on board amid an argument between the two passengers and staff before the women agreed to disembark, with no further issues. One passenger told Queensland’s Courier Mail that the singers “refused to follow crew instructions”. But the Veronicas have hit back at reporting of the cabin baggage incident, which they said was “incredibly intimidating and confusing”. “The details reported are false and in conflict with video recorded during the event and witness accounts from the flight,” they said on Instagram. “The incident was escalated without explanation why from the cabin staff. We cooperated with all requests from authorities and exited the aircraft.” Underneath a post from another passenger, they commented from their shared account, “this was crazy”, calling the event “an upsetting and embarrassing experience”. This makes me so upset to read 💔 I hope everything is better now @jessicaveronica @lisa_veronica , sending love always 💖 A post shared by  𝕋 ℍ 𝔼 𝕍 𝔼 ℝ 𝕆 ℕ 𝕀 ℂ 𝔸 𝕊 (@ayeveronicas) on Sep 22, 2019 at 2:26am PDT “We actually already had our bag up in the overhead,” they wrote. “The female flight attendant wanted Lisa’s bag spun around. Lisa asked the attendant if she could help assist her, because she couldn’t reach it (we’re only 5”1). The attendant said it was against company policy. And a lovely man behind us helped instead. “Then right before take off, the flight attendant bought over the manager and pointed us out. He proceeded to lecture us about company policy.” After this, they claimed, the staff refused to give the duo their names, and threatened that they would call security. “We had no idea why. That’s when we started filming! “We were so confused as to why asking for their names resulted in us being removed by 3 federal police,” they continued. “We are still in shock and so upset … It’s so scary they can call federal police on people without any reason or explanation.” The Veronicas, who caught a later flight to Brisbane, added they were pursuing legal action over the incident and media reports of it. Police said they were still looking into the incident.
