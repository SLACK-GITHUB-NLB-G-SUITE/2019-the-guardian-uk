Nick Carter, a member of boy band Backstreet Boys, has taken out a restraining order against his brother, pop star Aaron Carter. Nick wrote that “after careful consideration” he and his sister Angel had both sought restraining orders. He added: “In light of Aaron’s increasingly alarming behaviour and his recent confession that he harbors thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child, we were left with no choice but to take every measure possible to protect ourselves and our family.” Aaron confirmed the order on Twitter, and wrote: “I never threatened anyone. I’m appalled by this and don’t ever wish to speak to them again … All I ask is for my family to leave me alone.” He told TMZ: “I am astounded at the accusations being made against me and I do not wish harm to anyone, especially my family.” He claimed that he had not seen brother Nick in four years. Aaron Carter’s career began in 1997, aged nine, when he scored two UK Top 10 hits with songs from his debut album. He released four more albums, including a comeback release in 2018, and appeared on numerous reality TV shows including Dancing With the Stars. He entered a rehab facility in September 2017, following a dramatic drop in weight after he “just stopped eating”. Earlier this month he appeared on US TV show The Doctors to discuss his mental health. “The official diagnosis is that I suffer from multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, acute anxiety; I’m manic depressive,” he said. Nick Carter achieved superstardom with Backstreet Boys, who have released nine albums – their third, Millennium, is the fourth biggest-selling album ever in the US, and their 2019 comeback album DNA reached No 1.
