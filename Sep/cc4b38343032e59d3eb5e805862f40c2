A Belgian F-16 fighter pilot has been rescued from a high-voltage electricity line after his jet crashed in Brittany, France. The plane came down over the town of Pluvigner at about 10.30am local time on Thursday, narrowly missing a house. The two pilots were able to eject, with one safely picked up on the ground. However, the other pilot’s parachute got caught on a 250,000-volt high-tension electricity line. Local media broadcast images of the pilot dangling below the line. He was rescued by emergency crews with the help of technicians from an electricity company.

A Belgian defence ministry spokesperson said investigators from the Aviation Safety Directorate had been dispatched to the scene to determine the cause of the accident. A French police spokeswoman said there were no injuries among residents and that 100 police officers had surrounded the crash site to look for clues as to the cause.  The F-16 crashed 50 metres from a house, damaging part of the roof at the rear. The owners were evacuated. “We were in the garden. There were aircraft passing overhead, over the trees. We heard a loud bang and the noise of metal tearing. A few moments later, there was a second explosion and more tearing metal. Then silence,” one resident told Ouest-France. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic aircraft originally developed for the US air force and that first went into service in 1973.
