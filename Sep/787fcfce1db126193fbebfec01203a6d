Liverpool have accepted an improved offer from Fiorentina for Bobby Duncan days after the striker’s agent accused the club of “mentally bullying” the teenager. The 18-year-old is expected on Monday to sign a three-year contract with the Italian club, who have agreed a £1.8m fee plus 20% of any sell-on with Liverpool. Last week Liverpool rejected Fiorentina’s offer to take Steven Gerrard’s cousin on loan with a view to a £1.5m summer transfer, prompting a furious statement from the player’s agent, Saif Rubie, that mired Duncan in controversy. On Friday Jürgen Klopp suggested a contract dispute was at the heart of Duncan’s stand-off with his boyhood club and hoped a resolution could be found by all parties doing “the right things”. Fiorentina’s latest bid, however, will give Liverpool a healthy return on an academy prospect they signed for £200,000 from Manchester City last year. The profit available, combined with the unseemly episode over the player’s future, prompted Liverpool’s decision to part company with a player who scored 32 goals for their youth teams last season. Duncan was also involved in a contract dispute with City, when under a different agent, and believed he should have been part of Klopp’s senior squad rather than playing for the under‑18s and under-23s. He missed the under‑23s game at Southampton last week because of stress, his agent said. Liverpool dismissed Rubie’s allegations against the club and the sporting director, Michael Edwards, as unfounded and inaccurate.
