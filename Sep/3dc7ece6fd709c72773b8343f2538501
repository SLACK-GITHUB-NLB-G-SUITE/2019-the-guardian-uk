Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, shimmied his way on to Dancing with the Stars on Monday night in a shiny fluorescent green ruffled shirt and white trousers, brushing off criticism of his casting in the reality TV show by saying it was “finally time to enjoy myself”. In his attempt to dance the salsa to the Spice Girls hit Spice Up Your Life – highlights of which included some out-of-time clapping and a jubilant knee-slide finale – it was clear that the controversial former Trump aide was not holding back. Spicer’s inclusion has prompted criticism, with the show’s own host, Tom Bergeron, saying the competition is meant to offer “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” free from “party affiliations”. Triple the spice in this Salsa! 🌶 #DWTS @seanspicer pic.twitter.com/L85aPYVGt0 But when the judges’ comments came, there were no bushes for Spicer, 47, to take cover in. Bruno Tonioli said Spicer looked like he was being “attacked by a swarm of wasps” on the bongos and that his hips “looked like they were set in cement”. But, he conceded, “I have to say it was strangely entertaining.” Carrie Ann Inaba said: “You were off beat most of the dance, but you had fun.” Len Goodman commended his “courage coming on this show”. Each judge gave him four points, leaving him with an overall score of 12 out of 30. But online, critics were not so kind: We can’t wait to see how flexible Sean Spicer is on Dancing with the Stars since he had his spine removed years ago. #DWTS Happy Hispanic Heritage Month, peeps.This fool failing at dancing Salsa while dressed like a neon parakeet with ruffles (obviously, the #DWTS wardrobe people are part of The Resistance), just made the argument of why this country needs Hispanics. https://t.co/AINUnSWvgQ Would I be a bad person if I secretly hoped that @seanspicer broke both of his legs competing on #DWTS? pic.twitter.com/GY6xTOIX5u Many mocked his costume, suggesting it was the work of a Democrat. Clearly the Costume designer on #dwts is a Democrat. #nicelydone #SeanSpicer https://t.co/s2VVDoKzoa Some were already looking forward to the response of Melissa McCarthy, who has parodied Spicer on Saturday Night Live. I can't wait until @MelissaMcCarthy wins an Emmy for her #SNL performance of @seanspicer on #DWTS! pic.twitter.com/AgIXNQrgwv At least he could take comfort in the kindness of former colleagues. The former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus posted a photo and the comment: “Fantastic time cheering on Sean Spicer live from #DWTS!” The former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee also tweeted his support, encouraging viewers to vote for Spicer. Huckabee’s tweet elicited a self-pitying response from Spicer, who appeared to take aim at the judges. “Clearly the judges aren’t going to be with me. Let’s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won’t be discounted. May God bless you,” he tweeted. During Spicer’s tenure in the White House, he was criticized over a number of misleading statements, including the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. He was also condemned for claiming that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against the German people. After he resigned in July 2017, he made a cameo at the Emmy awards and wrote a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President, in which he referred to Trump as “unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow”. Spicer follows in the post-White House reality show footsteps of fellow Trump staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother after working for the president.
