An RAF senior aircraftman has died after being injured playing in an inter-services rugby league match against the army. Scott Stevenson was hurt playing in the game at Aldershot last Friday night and news of his death was announced by his family in a Facebook post on Monday evening. Stevenson, 25, who was based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, also played for the Boston Buccaneers community club in Lincolnshire. The Rugby Football League’s chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, said: “This is tragic and heartbreaking news and I know everyone involved in the game will join me in sending deepest condolences to Scott’s family and friends, and to all involved in rugby league in the RAF and the other services.” The RFL has offered support to the family and the RAF Rugby League through the Rugby League Benevolent Fund.
