It was brilliant, and even had Tiger Woods fist-pumping in the crowd â€¦ but better than Novak Djokovicâ€™s in 2014? You decide. 4) Bone-crunching NRL tackle alert! Cameron Munster is monstered by Jorge Taufua. 5) Some goals of the week, featuring a couple of bangers here and here and a straight-from-kick-off beauty from Charlton Under-18sâ€™ Aaron Henry. ðŸ˜± STUNNER!The Addicks' U18s beat @ManUtd4-2 in a friendly last week...Oh, and Aaron Henry casually scored direct from kick-off... #cafc pic.twitter.com/S2aCl3pI6Y 6) Donâ€™t grow marijuana on rooftops along the Vuelta route. 1) Bury at Bramall Lane in 1902. 2) Welcome to Psicobloc, the most extreme sport youâ€™ve never heard of.
