In this time of divisive politics, we are rarely afforded the opportunity to support a proposal that cannot, or should not, be opposed by anyone of any political belief. When it comes to assisted dying, it remains a divisive issue that not even all the signatories of this letter agree on. But as parliamentarians we must make policy decisions based on robust evidence. MPs from across the House of Commons have repeatedly asked the Ministry of Justice to look at the effects of the current blanket ban on assisted dying and how it is enforced. This week we heard from a group of police and crime commissioners who have now also called on the government to examine the consequences of section 2 of the 1961 Suicide Act, which criminally implicates anyone providing assistance to someone to die. We know from cases such as Ann Whaley’s and Mavis Eccleston’s just this year the difficult decisions that some dying people and their families are forced into as a result of the current law. No matter our views on whether and to what extent assisted dying can be legalised safely, we should all agree that the only way to ensure the law is fit for purpose is to hear from those it affects most.Nick Boles MP, Oliver Letwin MP, Karin Smyth MP, Lucy Allan MP, Paul Blomfield MP, Crispin Blunt MP, Vince Cable MP, Sarah Champion MP, Frank Field MP, Jim Fitzpatrick MP, Kate Green MP, Stephen Kinnock MP, Norman Lamb MP, Caroline Lucas MP, Huw Merriman MP, Nigel Mills MP, Andrew Mitchell MP, Sarah Newton MP, Melanie Onn MP, Claire Perry MP, Antoinette Sandbach MP, Anna Soubry MP, Stephen Twigg MP, Dr Sarah Wollaston MP • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
