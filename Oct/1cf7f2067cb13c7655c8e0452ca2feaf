In response to your article about racism in football at the Bulgaria-England game (Report, 15 October), as a Bulgarian I have to say that racism in all its forms has to be eradicated. What I will not take though is lectures about equality and decency from English football fans. I was there that day on the streets of Sofia. English football fans were later outraged that Bulgarian fans were making racist monkey chants at the stadium. Well, English fans were making loud animal sounds surrounding me as I was walking on the street. Can women also not be animals for English fans, the same way people of colour are non-animals for them? That would be appreciated. I find it ridiculous that English football fans are taking the moral high ground. Equality is across the board.
