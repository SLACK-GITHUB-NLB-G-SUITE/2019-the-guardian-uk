The Lionesses are set to break the attendance record for a women’s match in England with over 75,000 tickets sold for their game against Germany at Wembley on 9 November. The current record for a women’s match, 70,584, was set when Team GB beat Brazil at the 2012 Olympics. The Lionesses’ record attendance is currently 45,619, established when they beat Germany 3-0 at Wembley in 2014. In addition to the Wembley game, the FA have announced that over 30,000 tickets have been sold for Saturday’s friendly against Brazil at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium, which has a capacity of 34,742. The squad then fly out to play Portugal on Tuesday night. Phil Neville’s side will be hoping to end a run of four games without a win which began with defeat to eventual champions the US in the World Cup semi-finals. After losing their third-place play-off game to Sweden, a Nikita Parris penalty salvaged a 3-3 draw against Belgium and they lost 2-1 in Norway. The interest in watching the Lionesses is mirrored domestically, with more than 100,000 attending the opening three rounds of the Women’s Super League, topping the approximately 92,000 that attended across the course of all 110 games last season. The record 31,213 crowd for Manchester City v Manchester United at the Etihad, 24,790 at the London Stadium on Sunday and 24,564 at Stamford Bridge, make up the bulk of that figure and show that the drive of the FA and clubs to build on the success of the Women’s World Cup and draw the interest into the domestic game is bearing fruit.
