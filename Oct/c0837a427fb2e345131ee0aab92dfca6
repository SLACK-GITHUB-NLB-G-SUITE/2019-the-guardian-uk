Liverpool could be without Joël Matip until after the next international break because of the knee injury that has restricted the defender to one appearance in the last month. Matip suffered a kick to the knee in the win at Sheffield United on 28 September and returned to the side against Manchester United following a three-week recovery period. The central defender felt the injury again at Old Trafford, however, and Liverpool plan to ease his return to full fitness. The 28-year-old, who recently signed a five-year contract at Liverpool, will miss Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie with Arsenal, Saturday’s Premier League visit to Aston Villa, the Champions League return with Genk and Manchester City’s trip to Anfield should he remain sidelined until after the international break. Jürgen Klopp has favoured Dejan Lovren over Joe Gomez in Liverpool’s last three matches without Matip.
