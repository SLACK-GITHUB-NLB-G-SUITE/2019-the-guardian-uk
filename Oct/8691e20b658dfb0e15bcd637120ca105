Injury-hit Norwich City picked up a first Premier League clean sheet and away point of the season after grinding out a goalless draw at Bournemouth. Ben Godfrey, who underwent a hernia operation during the international break, limped off early in the second half, leaving the Canaries with a makeshift pairing of Alex Tettey and Ibrahim Amadou. “To have a first away point on this level and also the first clean sheet under your belt is always difficult but important and we did this,” said Norwich’s manager Daniel Farke. “The situation we had at the end I had to play without any centre-backs – all my four centre-backs are injured. We had periods when we controlled this game and were pretty close to gaining all three points.” Norwich’s battling display ended a three-game losing streak, that included a 5-1 thrashing by Aston Villa a fortnight ago, and produced a first point since shocking Manchester City last month. Teemu Pukki almost gave them all three points with a powerful second-half drive that was tipped wide by Aaron Ramsdale. Dominic Solanke came closest to breaking the deadlock for the hosts when he was denied by Tim Krul in the first half before the Cherries’ performance petered out. It was their first 0-0 draw in the league for a year. “People will see the fact we’re playing Norwich at home and the expectation is for it to be a home win and I understand that and that’s certainly our expectation as well,” said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe. “But these games are never that easy. I fully respect Norwich and their manager, their players and the way that they play. They’re a tough nut to crack and they were today for us. “We sort of faded away in the game, stopped doing the things that had brought us that early dominance and then became quite desperate to score.”
