Germany squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Argentina thanks to Lucas Ocampos’s 85th-minute equaliser in a friendly in Dortmund on Wednesday. The hosts, missing a dozen players and without a single world champion in the starting lineup for the first time since 2014, fielded an inexperienced team including newcomers Robin Koch and Luca Waldschmidt. What they lacked in experience, however, they made up for in enthusiasm in the first half, with Serge Gnabry continuing his prolific run a week after his four goals against Tottenham with his 10th goal in his 11th international, putting the hosts ahead after quarter of an hour. Gnabry turned provider seven minutes later when he found Kai Havertz in the box to complete a quick move. Marcel Halstenberg then rattled the crossbar with a stunning left-footed free-kick as did Argentina’s Rodrigo De Paul with a long-range effort. The visitors, without the suspended Lionel Messi as well as Ángel Di María and Sergio Agüero, cut the deficit in the 66th minute through substitute Lucas Alario who instantly added more pace to their game. Germany, who had four players making their debuts, gradually ran out of steam and the visitors completed their comeback when Alario charged into the box to lay off for Ocampos to score the equaliser.
