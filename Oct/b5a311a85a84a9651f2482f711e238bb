Billy Vunipola came through Wednesday’s final training session before Eddie Jones names his England team to face Australia on Saturday with the No 8 in line to start against the Wallabies. Vunipola has been recovering from a twisted ankle sustained against Argentina but after taking a full part in the decisive session he looks set for a 13th straight start for England. It comes as a major boost to Jones, who has no like-for-like replacement, and means England are set to be unchanged from the side who comfortably beat the Pumas. The England defence coach, John Mitchell, revealed that Vunipola had been on a restricted training programme and while he said that the No 8 was “very likely” to play against Australia he insisted that he would have to be 100% fit to be considered. Vunipola has suggested recently he has not performed at his maximum level of late, but Mitchell expressed confidence he will make an impact if selected against the Wallabies. “He’s going well. Like any player, he wants to play better. He’s having to make a couple of little adjustments in his game, because players obviously start to read you in terms of what you do. He’s at a very optimal body weight. The last campaign, it was too extreme, whereas at the minute he’s at an optimal stage. If he loses too much weight, it’s not ideal for him.” England have a six-match winning streak against Australia since Jones took over but Saturday is their first World Cup knockout match for eight years. “It’s exciting and these are the games you want to be involved in against some quality opposition,” said the England assistant coach Steve Borthwick. “Our preparation has gone really well over the period of time – specifically the last 10 days – and the guys are raring to go. Our concentration is on the game and delivering the best possible performance and that is our focus. The players are looking in very good physical shape and their eagerness to get stuck in and they are excited by it.”
