Organisers said “unprecedented” wind gusts flipped RED E just north of Coober Pedy. The driver was unhurt but was taken to hospital for observation before being released. The conditions also claimed German team Sonnenwagen and Kogakuin from Japan with their cars blown off the road. Both teams were delayed but were expected to reach the finish. Agoria’s car Bluepoint was due to cross the line around noon on Thursday.
