On what basis is The Tale of Genji considered “the world’s first novel” (Lost chapter of world’s oldest novel found in storage chest in Japanese home, 11 October)? From the Romano-Hellenistic world we seem to have disqualified (not necessarily the first, but the oldest that have survived) a romantic novel, Longus’ Daphnis and Chloe; a satirical novel, Apuleius’s The Golden Ass; and a science fiction novel, Lucian’s Vera Historia. Charles BailyBedford • It’s good to see the National Portrait Gallery is staging an exhibition of pre-Raphaelite female artists. But this isn’t their first dedicated exhibition (Taking flight, Review, 12 October). There was an excellent exhibition, Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists, in 1998 in Manchester, Birmingham and Southampton. I still have the accompanying book.Angie BurnsStafford • Dessert, sweet and afters are all acceptable but pudding is not (Letters, 12 October). A pudding is a type of dessert made from suet, ie spotted dick, preferably smothered in custard. How could a creme caramel or ice-cream be described as a pudding?John RixRugby, Warwickshire • I was once invited to have “luncheon” at the country home of a genteel, middle-aged lady. Following a delightful first course, and expecting “afters” she leaned in and said: “Would you like sex?” Panic set in until I realised that she meant seconds – another helping.Christine OzanneLondon • Strange to see a report that having found a “pathway” to a deal, Boris Johnson has signalled a U-turn (Report, 12 October). I hope he checked his mirrors first because it sounds like a risky manoeuvre.Richard CooperChichester, West Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
