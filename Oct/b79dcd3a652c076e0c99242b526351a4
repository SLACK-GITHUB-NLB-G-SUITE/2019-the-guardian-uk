It seems you are never too old to try new gardening thinking. For the first time I have veered from seed, succumbed to an email ad and bought Organic Gardening Catalogue ‘super plugs’. Specifically: 10 Winter Density lettuce, 20 Bright Lights rainbow chard and 20 Nero di Toscana kale. All organically grown, of course, and all replanted now on the plot in space opened by fallen sunflowers – felled at last by the first heavy rain and winds – and by lifting the last of the beetroots. Some sunflowers were first cut for home. The riper, larger heads spread on the communal table tops for birds to feed. A slightly scary amount of seed was already scattered over the soil. The other sunflowers re-homed from Kala’s garden are still standing tall. Our bean poles are down, too. The fattest pods now left to dry on a dish with Basque tear peas for sowing next spring. In their place, we have transplanted Joy Larkcom Midnight chard (bred out of Bull’s Blood by Adaptive Seeds), some red Treviso radicchio and the last of the Gulag Stars kale from our nursery beds. I’ll see how the home-grown veggies compare to the imported plugs and report back. To even out the odds against them, another first: we are covering both sets of the infant winter crops to keep off voracious pigeons. Some are protected with bean poles that have been cut down and hung with woven net. Others are sheltered with wire-mesh mini-tunnels. It doesn’t come naturally to me, the caging. We have avoided it before, but maybe parenting other people’s baby plants brings different responsibilities. We’re undecided how long the cages will stay. Perhaps just until our autumn leaves are vegetable teenagers and can more strongly stand on their own. Allan Jenkins’s Morning (4th Estate, £8.99) is out now.
