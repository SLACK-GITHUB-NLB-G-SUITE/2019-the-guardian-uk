We all know about the bizarre cravings for pickles to overcome morning sickness, or the frantic panic to rearrange cupboards as a due date looms, but the impact that pregnancy and birth has on women’s bodies differs greatly and can be defining of early parenthood. From the heavy bleeding that affects many, to sheet-drenching night sweats, hair loss, and even an increase in shoe size for some, the body recovers from having a baby in some weird and wonderful ways. And as much as you can you can prepare yourself for these postnatal changes, they are still fairly surprising, especially when you throw newborn-induced sleeplessness into the mix as well. We want to know the most unexpected thing that has happened to your body as a result of pregnancy or birth and how it has impacted on your health long-term if at all.
