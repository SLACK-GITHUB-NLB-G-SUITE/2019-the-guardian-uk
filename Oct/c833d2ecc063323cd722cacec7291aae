Rangers came from behind to keep pace with their historic rivals in the Scottish Premiership title race, beating Motherwell 2-1 after Celtic had thumped Aberdeen 4-0. Devante Cole’s low strike gave Well a 21st-minute lead at Ibrox, before James Tavernier missed a chance to equalise from the spot, sending his effort against the woodwork after being brought down by Liam Polworth. Jermain Defoe did level things up in first-half stoppage time, firing in on the rebound after Mark Gillespie opted to punch away Steven Davis’ 25-yard strike. But the hosts found their winner 10 minutes from time, when Filip Helander threw himself at Tavernier’s corner to head home from the centre of the box. In the day’s earlier kick-off, Celtic cruised to a comfortable win at Pittodrie. French forward Odsonne Edouard struck in the 10th minute, before 18-year-old Dutch right back Jeremie Frimpong doubled that lead five minutes later with his first Hoops goal in his first away match since signing from Manchester City in September. Derek McInnes’ side offered little resistance and further first-half strikes from attackers James Forrest and Mohamed Elyounoussi left Aberdeen in tatters and their supporters far from happy. The results leave Rangers and Celtic level on 25 points at the top of the table, with Neil Lennon’s men at the summit on goal difference.
