After six weeks and 46 matches featuring 20 teams, we are ready for the Rugby World Cup final. England and South Africa will meet in Yokohama on Saturday to battle it out for the Webb Ellis Cup. This is not the first time the countries have contested a final. When they met in Paris in 2007, South Africa came out on top, beating England 15-6. Eddie Jones was part of the South Africa coaching team that day. Now he is in charge of England. The final is kicking off early for fans in the two countries: 9am in England and 11am in South Africa. We’d like to hear from both sets of supporters about your plans for the match. Are you watching it in a pub, have you organised a party, or will you be tuning in over breakfast at home? Will you be decked out in your team’s kit and do you have any lucky charms? Do you wear the same hat, drink coffee from the same mug or always sit in the same chair? We’d love to see pictures of the lucky garment that has carried your team to the final. And we’d like to hear your thoughts about the game. Will your team be crowned champions?
