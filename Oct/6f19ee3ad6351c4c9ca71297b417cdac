Paths linking shrines and cathedrals offer not only beautiful countryside but a connection with history, myth and early literature (think The Canterbury Tales) going back through the medieval era to the Dark Ages and beyond. Tell us about your experiences; the people you met, the most picturesque stretches, the stories that swirl around the trail and the historic buildings you came across. Please include details of exact locations of the start and end of the trail with any relevant websites and price information. You may have camped en route or found a cosy B&B or other accommodation; if so, please include details. But even if your walk was just a day trip, feel free to share your experiences. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 29 October 2019, 10am GMT If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
