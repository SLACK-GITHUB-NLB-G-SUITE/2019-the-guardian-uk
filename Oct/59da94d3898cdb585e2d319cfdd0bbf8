Watford are still searching for a win and will be looking to build on a positive display, that ended in a draw, against Tottenham in order to break their duck. A difficult proposition though considering no Watford player has scored more than one goal yet. Troy Deeney has been sorely missed and Bournemouth will be glad the striker still needs time to recover from a knee injury. Eddie Howe’s side are looking to end a winless run of their own stretching to four matches in all competitions.
