Can David Cox advise on how I can time travel back to pre-2010? This would enable me to follow his advice to get a doctor’s appointment and an antiviral prescription within 48 hours of noticing flu symptoms (Five ways to recover from flu, G2, 30 September). That was before Tory government “reforms” effectively torpedoed the GP system. Is a four- to five-week wait a bit too long?Roger DriscollEpping, Essex • Sajid Javid asserted on the Today programme on Monday that “you can knock on any door and one of the first things you’ll hear is ‘get Brexit done’”. Clearly these are carefully selected doors – if he knocked on my door he would hear something completely different.Cherry WestonWolverhampton • Douglas Adams gave us a hint to solving global heating in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. We should build a big spaceship, fill it with the all the earth’s advertising and marketing executives, and then launch them into space to go and colonise a very distant planet.John SquiresSwanage, Dorset • As the country threatens to split into those who have tea, dinner or supper (Letters, 1 October), can I plead for a compromise and suggest we refer to them all as the evening meal? Please?Colin HarrisonChesterfield, Derbyshire • It’s what you eat, as well as where or when you eat it. Dinner is more work for the cook than supper. So I make dinner on a Sunday, but just cook supper for the evening in the week. South of the Wash, it’s only tea if there’s no cooking.Eva LawrenceSt Albans, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
