Harold Pinter and I once paid a visit to James Joyce’s grave in Zurich, since James Joyce was his hero: two of the “pilgrim tourists” to which your editorial refers (22 October). The grave lies high over the city; apparently when he was buried there was a zoo nearby and Nora was cheered by the thought of Jimmy listening to the lions. Nowadays a statue of Joyce marks it, and I took a photo of the two of them which Harold treasured. I understand completely why the city of Zurich does not want such a perfect place of pilgrimage disturbed.

The pin drops around 36 Irk Street with a hefty reality dose. I suspect LS Lowry would still have recognised it – for now. Hilary GrimeOxford • Re the letter on misuse of English abroad (19 October). We were on holiday in Brittany and hired a small boat for a trip on the Nantes-Brest canal. A sign on the front of the boat read “defense de peche”. Underneath was a translation into English which read “sinning is forbidden”.Chris Sharples Egerton, Greater Manchester • As we see yet another photo of Dominic Cummings arriving in Downing Street (22 October), could your fashion editor help me – is his style “Brexit casual”?Helen EvansRuthin, Denbighshire • Deborah Orr brightened up all our Saturdays through the wonderful and eclectic Guardian Weekend. “Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis”.Síobhan Ní ChuanaighDublin, Ireland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
