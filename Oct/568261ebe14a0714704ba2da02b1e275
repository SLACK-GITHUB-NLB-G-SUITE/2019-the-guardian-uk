The leaves have turned, the clocks have gone back, and there’s a cold snap in the air. This can only mean one thing: Halloween is just around the corner and so pumpkin carvings are unleashed on our neighbours’ doorsteps, school displays and social media feeds once more. But pumpkin carving is treacherous stuff, and very difficult to pull off. To get us in the Halloween spirit, we want pictures and stories of your worst carved pumpkins and what happened to them. You can share your stories and images in the encrypted form below, only the Guardian will see your responses. We will include some of your submissions in our reporting.
