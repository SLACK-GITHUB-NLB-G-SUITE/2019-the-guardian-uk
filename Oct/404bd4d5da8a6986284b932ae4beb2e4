Reading have sacked manager José Gomes after a disappointing run left the club 22nd in the Championship. Gomes, who arrived at the Madejski Stadium in December 2018, helped keep the Royals up last season, but after two wins in their opening 11 league games, the club have acted. “Owner Mr Yongge Dai has made the difficult decision to part company with Gomes and make a change at first-team level,” read a club statement. “We would like to sincerely thank José for his hard work during his tenure as manager at Reading Football Club and we wish him the very best of luck in his future career. The club will make no additional comment at this time but will provide further updates as soon as possible.” Gomes joined Reading in December 2018, leaving Portuguese Primeira Liga side Rio Ave to take up the post. He replaced caretaker manager Scott Marshall, who stepped in after Paul Clement was fired. His arrival helped the Royals avoid relegation, ultimately ending last season in 20th place, seven points clear of the drop zone. This season has proved a struggle, however, with the club only claiming two Championship victories so far and currently enduring a seven-game winless streak. Gomes’s tenure at Reading was his 13th managerial role in 16 years. Fellow Championship strugglers Barnsley axed manager Daniel Stendel on Tuesday, when League One Sunderland also fired Jack Ross.
