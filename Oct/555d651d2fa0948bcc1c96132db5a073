Australia continued their domination over Sri Lanka with a thumping 157-run win in the opening match of their three-game ODI series at Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Australia scored a highly competitive 281-8 off their 50 overs on Saturday, before dismissing Sri Lanka for just 124 off 41.3 overs. A strong all-round showing with the ball highlighted Australia’s performance, with the wickets shared among five bowlers. Spinner Ash Gardner led the way with 2-9 from nine overs, while there were equally impressive figures for Tayla Vlaeminck (2-14) and Jess Jonassen (2-17). Sri Lanka’s hopes of overhauling the Aussies for an unlikely win floundering early on at 46-3 with the dismissal of star batter Chamari Atapattu, who was caught off the bowling of spinner Jonassen. It was a 16th consecutive ODI win for Australia and follows on from a clean sweep of the recent T20 series. Sri Lanka did fight back with the ball earlier in the day, putting the brakes on the home side after they raced to 138-1. Captain Meg Lanning posted a fourth consecutive ODI half-century with a confident 73 from 66 balls to be named player of the match. In combination with Rachael Haynes (56), the pair put on a match-high 126 for the second wicket. There was a rare failure for star all-rounder Ellyse Perry who was run out for 19, while opener Alyssa Healy was unable to follow up her world record T20 exploits four days earlier by being caught and bowled for eight. Beth Mooney maintained her bright start to the summer with a convincing knock of 66, while Ash Gardner fell for just seven. Australia will face Sri Lanka in the second ODI in Brisbane on Monday while the final international - also at Allan Border Field - is scheduled for Wednesday.
