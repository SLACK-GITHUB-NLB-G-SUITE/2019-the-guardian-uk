Make a loose, green paste with 3 medium-sized green tomatoes, 3 jalape√±o chillies, 3 cloves of peeled garlic and 100g of coriander leaves and their stems. It is done in seconds in a blender or food processor. Cut 3 medium to large tomatoes in half then cut each into 3 segments. Peel then finely slice 1 red onion and toss it with the sliced tomatoes. Coarse grate 200g of a firm, deeply flavoured cheese. Lay a tortilla in a frying pan or cast-iron griddle pan and scatter half the cheese evenly over the surface. Add half the sliced tomatoes and red onion then trickle over 3 tbsp of the green dressing. Place a second tortilla on top and toast over a medium heat for about 4 minutes, until the base browns in patches. Flip the tortilla and lightly brown the other side, by which time the cheese should be melting. Turn on to a plate or board and cut into 4 then continue with 2 more tortilla and more of the filling. Serve with the remaining dressing. Enough for 2 large tortillas. Turn the quesadilla halfway through cooking by placing a large plate or round board on top of the pan. Hold the plate in place and turn the pan over so the tortilla flips out on to the plate. Return the pan to the heat and slide the quesadilla back into the pan. The cheese needs to be a semi-hard variety that melts into long strings in low heat, such as queso oaxaca (I like the one made by Gringa Dairy, which you can buy online). If necessary, introduce a little olive oil to the paste as you blend. Much will depend on the juiciness of your tomatoes. As much as I delight in the simplicity of a quesadilla filled with ripe tomatoes, melted cheese and coriander salsa, other fillings beckon. Crushed avocados with chopped chillies and lime juice is always welcome, as is a stuffing of steamed squash, mashed and seasoned with chillies, coriander and spring onions. You can be as inventive as if you were filling a sandwich. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
