Ed Woodward said the Glazer family do not wish to sell Manchester United and the owners have received no offers for the club. There are reports that Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman would like to buy the club, but the executive vice-chairman denied there had been any concrete bids. “Based on what I see, they’re in it for the long-term,” Woodward told the United We Stand fanzine of the Glazers. “With regards to offers or asking prices, my understanding is that there have been no discussions for a price for the club or anything like that. Every conversation we have is based on the long-term. “The debt is a long-term, structured and similar to some other football clubs. It’s a fixed amount for a fixed period of time which results in it being fairly cheap to service. It’s just under two per cent of our annual revenue each year, so it doesn’t really have any impact on us.”
