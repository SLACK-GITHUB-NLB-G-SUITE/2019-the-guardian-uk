The Houston Astros have fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman following an investigation into a clubhouse outburst directed toward a group of female reporters after the team’s ALCS victory on Saturday night. The team released a statement Thursday that said Taubman’s conduct did not reflect the organization’s values “and we believe this is the most appropriate course of action”. Sports Illustrated’s Stephanie Apstein reported Taubman yelled toward a group of female reporters about closer Roberto Osuna, who was suspended last year for violating MLB’s domestic violence policy before being traded from Toronto to the Astros. The report said the 34-year-old Taubman “turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, ‘Thank God we got Osuna! I’m so fucking glad we got Osuna!’ The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.” The Astros’ initially rebutted the story, saying “[Taubman’s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else”, and accusing the magazine of “fabricating” the report. Major League Baseball said Wednesday they would speak with the Astros to determine whether the commissioner’s office or the club will handle any decision regarding Taubman’s status. On Thursday, the team announced they had terminated Taubman’s employment with the organization, adding: “We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct.” The Astros have dropped the first two games of the World Series at home to the Washington Nationals with Game 3 scheduled for Friday night in the national’s capital.
