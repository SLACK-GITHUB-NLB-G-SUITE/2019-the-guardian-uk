Northern Ireland endured heartbreak in Rotterdam as the Netherlands scored twice in stoppage time to snatch a 3-1 victory which leaves Euro 2020 qualification hopes hanging by a thread for Michael O’Neill’s side. Josh Magennis’s header had Northern Ireland dreaming of a victory that would have ranked among their greatest results but it all fell apart late on. Memphis Depay equalised five minutes after the Netherlands fell behind and then scored his second in the fourth minute of stoppage time after setting up Luuk de Jong for the second. Northern Ireland had battled bravely for 90 minutes and looked like they would be rewarded with a point that would have kept them firmly in the reckoning to reach the finals next summer. But instead they ended the night third in Group C, level on points with the Dutch and Germany, who have both played a game fewer and who will both face Northern Ireland next month.
