Two of the first three fillies in the betting for the 1,000 Guineas next year will face off at Group One level at Newmarket on Friday afternoon when Quadrilateral and Love go to post for the Fillies’ Mile. Love is a Group One winner already in the Moyglare Stud Stakes while Quadrilateral finished nine lengths clear at Newbury last time. But they face a stern opponent in the unbeaten Cayenne Pepper (3.35), a stablemate of Sunday’s Marcel Boussac winner, Albigna, at the Jessica Harrington yard. Harrington also took the Cheveley Park Stakes with Millisle and Cayenne Pepper can complete a remarkable treble for the trainer in the autumn’s major Group Ones for juvenile fillies. Newmarket 1.50 Platinum Star was a runner-up at Royal Ascot and has obvious claims but Jamaheery catches the eye further down the betting. She was impressive on debut at Yarmouth and fillies have a decent record in this, winning three of the last five. Chepstow 2.10 Any one of five or six could start favourite but it is interesting that Colin Tizzard launches the big-money recruit Fiddlerontheroof at Grade Two level and the hint could be worth taking. Newmarket 2.25 Stylistique is still a maiden after five starts but got to within half a length of the winner in the Rockfel last time and has an obvious chance to open her account eased in grade. York 2.40 The ground should suit Hortzadar, scratched from a race at Ayr last month when the going quickened up. He was prominent until the last 50 yards in the Irish Cambridgeshire in August and previously took a Ripon handicap off a 3lb lower mark. Newmarket 3.00 Shine So Bright could not last home after going too hard from a long way out at Doncaster last time. Silvestre De Sousa, who was aboard for his win in the Free Handicap in April, is back in the saddle and he should get his own way in front. York 3.50 Hamish was highly impressive when coming with a strong run from off a middling pace to land the Melrose over track and trip in August. He is up another 6lb in the weights but seems sure to be a Pattern-class performer in time. Newmarket 4.10 Battle Of Paradise will be popular for the ever-shrewd Sir Mark Prescott. Trueshan has plenty of scope too, however, will act on the ground and put up his best showing over the trip two runs ago.
