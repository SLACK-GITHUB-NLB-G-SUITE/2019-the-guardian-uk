I very much look forward to visiting Martin Parr’s photography exhibition in Cardiff . His exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery earlier this year was superb (Interview, G2, 14 October). Warm monochrome photographs of Yates’s Wine Lodge in Ashton-under-Lyne brought back vivid memories of waiting in line to be served a blob, akin to a rite of passage for Mancunians of a certain vintage. This delightful concoction consisted of a lump of white sugar slowly dissolving in a glass of warmed Australian white wine. Of course, it was the 1970s.Beverley MasonCardiff • If more people with hearing loss came to lipreading classes they would discover so many things available to help (Letters, 16 October).

Last week was an exercise on the painted lady butterfly, symbol of the Guardian’s campaign; its resilience giving us hope.Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • The testimony of Fiona Hill, former top advisor to the White House, could prove critical. In your report (14 October), you draw attention to how she “still speaks with flat northern vowels”. Having been brought up two streets away, and presumably sharing some of her “flat vowels”, I am left wondering if this bodes well or ill.Fiona CarrollFarringdon, Exeter • The Kurds stand for democracy, feminism, equality; Erdoğan stands for none of those things. If the west has “no dog in [this] fight” (Simon Jenkins, 14 October), then what do we stand for?Tom DaviesLiphook, Hampshire • “Whatever happened to ‘high tea’,” asks Judith Milnes (Letters, 11 October). I believe it got mixed up with the happy hour and became “high tiddly high tea”.Tully PotterTonbridge, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
