The teenager alleged to have thrown a six-year-old boy from the viewing platform at the Tate Modern has been named after he turned 18 and a reporting restriction protecting his identity expired. Jonty Bravery is accused of attempted murder after allegedly throwing the French child 30 metres (100ft) from the 10th floor of the London art gallery on to a fifth floor roof on 4 August. On Tuesday at the Old Bailey, the judge, Nicholas Hilliard QC, ruled the defendant could be identified upon turning 18 after an application for a new reporting restriction was turned down. No further details from the hearing can be disclosed. The victim, who cannot be named because of his age, is said to be making progress after being in a critical condition. However, his family said in a statement this week that “our little boy doesn’t know any more how to speak, to eat or to move his body” but that he is beginning to do his best to move his tongue, his right arm and hand. An update on a GoFundMe page that has raised almost £100,000 for the boy’s medical care said on Monday: “We see his efforts. We believe with all our heart that he will find the way, from his head, to do everything again. “He is very brave. He keeps on smiling and reacting to our jokes. We begin to see also, unfortunately, his suffering. Actually, he understands everything, but doesn’t understand why he cannot manage to eat or swallow a little bit of yogurt for instance … and he wants so much to be able to do it.”
