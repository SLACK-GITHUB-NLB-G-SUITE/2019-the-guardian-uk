Diana Ross will play the Sunday afternoon “legends” slot at Glastonbury 2020, her first performance at the festival. “To all my fans across the world, this is my tribute to you,” Ross said. “Every concert feels like a private party, I can see your eyes and feel your hearts. I’m coming to Glastonbury, with love.” The Sunday teatime slot is usually one of the biggest draws of the weekend. This year Kylie Minogue made her Glastonbury debut 14 years after she cancelled a headline slot in 2005 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was the most-watched Glastonbury performance ever on the BBC, with 3.9 million viewers tuning in. Ed Sheeran previously held the record at 3.1 million viewers for his 2017 headline slot. Ross is the first act to be announced for Glastonbury 2020. Tickets for the festival sold out in 34 minutes when they went on sale on Sunday, with a record-breaking 2.4 million people trying to secure one of the 135,000 places available. The bookmakers’ favourites to headline are Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift (whose European tour dates feature a conspicuously Glastonbury-shaped hole), Madonna, Fleetwood Mac and Oasis. Last month McCartney said he was “starting to think” about whether he could headline the festival, “or whether it would be a good thing”. Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus has poured cold water on rumours that the Swedish band could reform for the festival: “It’s a straight, straight no,” he said. Next year marks the festival’s 50th anniversary. To celebrate, its founder, Michael Eavis, and co-organiser Emily Eavis will publish a book, Glastonbury 50, featuring contributions from artists including Jay-Z, Adele, Dolly Parton, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Noel Gallagher, Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Billy Bragg.
