I bake and my nan cooks. Well, I cook as well, but you know what I mean. I have to admit, there have been a few times when Nan has stepped on my territory, the baking world. Did she succeed? Of course she did – with this bread pudding. And this is why she bossed it: it’s super simple, tasty and has a few twists here and there (she added coconut to it!). Nan is the best, I tell you. Forget the spoon for stirring – Nan doesn’t always use one. Prep 20 minRest 20 minCook 1 hr 20 minMakes 16 squares 500g wholemeal bread slices400g mixed dried fruit 150g desiccated coconut 100g mixed peel 2 tbsp mixed spice400ml whole milk200ml Guinness 2 tsp vanilla extract2 large eggs, beaten150g dark muscovado sugar 2 tsp fine sea saltZest of 2 oranges110g unsalted butter, melted and cooled 4 tbsp demerara sugar Tear the bread into a large mixing bowl, add the dried fruit, coconut, mixed peel and spice. Pour the milk, Guinness and vanilla over the bread and stir using your fingers (or a spoon), making sure that the bread is broken up. Add the eggs, sugar, salt and orange zest, give it another stir and set aside for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 and grease and line a 20cm nonstick square baking tin with baking paper. After the 20 minutes is up, stir in the melted and cooled butter, then tip the mixture into the tin, spreading evenly. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar, then bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until firm and golden. If the pudding starts to brown too much, pop some foil over the top. Leave to cool slightly, then flip it out of the pan, cut into squares and serve with a little cream – although it’s just as nice cold.
