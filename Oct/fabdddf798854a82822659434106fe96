Tacko Fall, who became the NBA’s tallest player when he signed with the Boston Celtics as an undrafted free agent in July, was forced to enter the league’s concussion protocol after hitting his head on a “low ceiling”, according to Masslive. The 7ft 5in center from Senegal said he suffered the bump when he was trying to wash his hands after a workout last Friday at the team’s practice facility but didn’t think anything of it, participating in a team charity event and an individual workout afterward with no noticeable effects. But Fall said he felt unwell the next morning and entered the league’s protocol for head injuries. The 24-year-old rookie, who is expected to spend most of the season with the G League’s Maine Red Claws, traveled to Philadelphia for Wednesday’s season opener against the 76ers but did not dress. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said on Wednesday that he expected Fall to be cleared for a return soon. “Very close [to a return] from what I’ve been told,” Stevens told reporters ahead of Boston’s 107-93 loss to Philadelphia. “But he wasn’t going to be active anyway.” #NEBHInjuryReport for tomorrow night vs Toronto:Tacko Fall (NBA Concussion Protocol) - OUTEnes Kanter (left knee contusion) - OUTRomeo Langford (sore right knee) - OUT Fall, who came to the United States when he was 16 and played collegiately at the University of Central Florida, set all-time records at the NBA’s draft combine for tallest height in shoes (7ft 7in), largest wingspan (8ft 2.25in) and highest standing reach (10ft 2.5in, 3.11 m).
