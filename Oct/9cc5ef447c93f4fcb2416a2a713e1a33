There are large acts of protest, such as the People’s Vote march that took place in London on Saturday. And then there are smaller ones, such as the work of the as yet unidentified individual who swapped the jacket of David Cameron’s autobiography for one of their own creation. Spotted by Alex Bray in Foyles on Charing Cross Road, London, the new version of Cameron’s For the Record looks at first glance unchanged – but the differences are a joy to behold. I popped into Foyles in my lunch break. Someone has been putting fake covers on @David_Cameron’s book. 😂 #Brexit @davidschneider @bbclaurak #davidcameron pic.twitter.com/B69bcJvI3M The cover has lost the Sunday Times’ glowing description (“The political memoir of the decade”) and is now adorned with a quote from Donald Trump: “A very great book. So great. No, it’s a great book. All the words. All the pages.” Then the back, which includes a positive verdict from Pliers of Chaka Demus and Pliers (“Hilarious”), and a damning write-up from Judy and Andy Murray, who found it “a poorly-written romp around the world, with hardly any reference to tennis whatsoever”. The real Judy Murray approves of this impersonation, by the way. But it’s the freshly written blurb that takes this to another level: “Women wanted him. Men wanted to be him. Animals feared him,” it begins, detailing how “within hours of moving into number 10, he’d installed a small urinal and a fax machine into all 38 rooms to ‘finally get things pumping on Downing Street’”. Cameron reportedly now “lives in a weird hut on wheels in the Cotswolds” where he “keeps wasps and brews his own vinegar”. A spokesperson for Foyles told the Guardian that “as far as we can tell”, there was only one copy with the swapped dust jacket, which had been removed from sale. “Since the images of the dummy jacket hit social media, we’ve seen a huge increase in interest both in store and online, with people wanting to buy this particular copy at well above the RRP,” they added. The sheer effort involved in this deserves applause – even the official cover photographer bows down before it. As yet, no one has come forward to admit to the switch, but – if it’s not Led By Donkeys – my money’s on a bookseller. After all, they have form for small acts of protest. Told to stock Cameron’s autobiography in the front window, Waterstones Piccadilly had its own, quiet response, propping Cameron up on a pile of Posh Boys: How the English Public Schools Ruin Britain, Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain, and Why We Get the Wrong Politicians. It follows 2010’s effort to get Tony Blair’s autobiography moved into the true-crime section in bookshops. A Facebook page with thousands of members signed up to “Subversively move Tony Blair’s memoirs to the crime section in bookshops [to] make bookshops think twice about where they categorise our generations [sic] greatest war criminal”. My favourite act of protest from a bookshop occurred at Denver bookseller Book Bar. After being targeted by white supremacists over its Drag Queen Story Hour, did staff back down or shy away from the attack? No, they recommended a load of books.
