The Personal History of David Copperfield, the Dickens adaptation starring Dev Patel and directed by Armando Iannucci, has emerged as the front runner for the British independent film awards (Bifa) with 11 nominations, including best British independent film and best actor for Patel. Runners-up in the nominations count is the country and western musical Wild Rose, which stars Jessie Buckley as a young Glaswegian singer dreaming of success and scored 10 nods, and the retro-horror homage In Fabric, directed by Peter Strickland, which has nine. Another auteur piece, the Joanna Hogg-directed The Souvenir, also did well, with eight nominations, including best director. Although it has not yet been released in the UK, The Personal History of David Copperfield won wide praise after its premiere at the Toronto film festival and its subsequent opening slot at the London film festival. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described it as a “terrifically likable, genial adaptation [that] taps into the author’s humanity and optimism” and “a bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience”. Surprisingly, though, despite receiving a nod for best screenplay, Iannucci has not been nominated for best director. Equally surprising is the absence of double Palme d’Or winner Ken Loach from the director list, with his latest film, the highly acclaimed gig-economy drama Sorry We Missed You securing only two nominations, for best actor (Kris Hitchen) and best screenplay (Paul Laverty). The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 1 December.
