Tonga came from behind at half-time to secure a clear win against USA and avoid finishing bottom of Pool C. A pair of tries from the replacement Mike Te’o enabled the Eagles to take a 12-7 lead into the interval but scores after the break from Malietoa Hingano, Siale Piutau and Telusa Veainu ensured Tonga ended their competition on a high. Tonga opened the scoring through a Siegfried Fisiihoi try after 16 minutes as their early pressure told. The winger Viliami Lolohea broke clear and when he was hauled down metres from the line, Fisiihoi picked up to go over. USA rallied with two tries in the space of five minutes from Te’o. Cam Dolan flicked the ball out the back of his hand to Te’o in space and the winger ran in under posts. Minutes later, the ball was worked wide for Te’o to finish in the corner. Tonga took the lead after 61 minutes when Veainu chipped over the top, chased his own kick and hacked the ball on for Lolohea, who fed Hingano to score. Just four minutes later Tonga extended their advantage with their third try. Sione Kalamafoni took the ball on from Fisiihoi after he broke clear and released captain Piutau to skip over. Tony Lamborn burrowed over from close range as USA hit back but Tonga secured the bonus point with their fourth try right on the whistle when Veainu latched on to James Faiva’s kick and touched down. • Fixtures, tables and results • Top try and points scorers • Stadium guide • Referee guide • Our latest minute-by-minute live reports • Sign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter Team guidesPool A: Ireland, Japan, Russia, Samoa, ScotlandPool B: Canada, Italy, Namibia, New Zealand, South AfricaPool C: Argentina, England, France, Tonga, USAPool D: Australia, Fiji, Georgia, Uruguay, Wales
