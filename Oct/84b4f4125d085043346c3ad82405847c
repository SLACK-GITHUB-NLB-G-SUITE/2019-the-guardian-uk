Manchester City are stepping up their pursuit of Napoli’s Fabián Ruiz and sent a scout to the Champions League game against Salzburg on Wednesday to watch the midfielder in action. The 23-year-old was the outstanding player of the Under-21 European Championship last summer when Spain won their fifth title and has impressed in Serie A since joining Napoli from Real Betis in 2018. City face competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid, who are keeping an eye on the development of a player who can play centrally or on the left of midfield and has been likened to David Silva. He made his Spain debut in June and has five caps. Napoli paid the buyout clause of €30m (£25.5m) when they signed Ruiz from Betis last year but will expect a significant return on that investment if he leaves in the summer. The Napoli chairman, Aurelio De Laurentiis, said last week: “I paid €30m for Fabián and he’s a fantastic player. If some of the European top clubs were to offer €180m we can start talking about selling him.” The relationship between Napoli and City took a turn for the worse over Jorginho, who ended up joining Chelsea together with the then Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri in July 2018, but that is not expected to be a problem if an offer for Ruiz meets Napoli’s valuation.
