Leaves on the line. The wrong kind of rain. A shortage of writing crew. Yes, today’s Mill is running behind, so let’s not waste any further time, because … Internazionale want a slice of Burnley’s Jay Rodriguez. Yes, reports from CalcioMercato suggest the 30-year-old forward is high on the Serie A leaders’ wish-list, even if only as a back-up to what is a half-decent forward line. More likely, we’d wager, is a move in the other direction involving the multi-title-winning manager Massimiliano Allegri, who has been learning English as part of his prep work for a job in the Premier League. Naturally, a potential vacancy at ongoing underwhelmists Manchester United is being mooted, but then again Allegri was in north London to see Spurs get spanked and there was a proper end-of-days feel to that one. Mention of United brings us on to their daily linkage: it’s Lyon’s Moussa Dembélé and fellow mainstay of this column, Newcastle tyro Sean Longstaff. Not that either would likely shift the general and miserable malaise within the club’s structure and hierarchy, but hey: transfers! Diego Costa could be taking his leave of Atlético Madrid for a pure footballing move to Al Rayyan in Qatar, while news from Bristol arrives of Middlesbrough interest in Rovers striker Jonson Clarke-Harris. And after their miserable run under Nathan Jones continued with a late 1-0 home defeat to fellow Championship strugglers, Stoke City are ready to bid Nathan Jones adieu. Favourite to replace him: Serge Gnabry fan Tony Pulis.
