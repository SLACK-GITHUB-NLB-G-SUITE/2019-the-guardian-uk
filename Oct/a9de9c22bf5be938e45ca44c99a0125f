The first clásico of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid has been rescheduled for 18 December. Barça were initially due to host their arch-rivals at the Nou Camp on Saturday, but the game was postponed by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) last week because of security concerns in Catalonia. Both clubs rejected a proposal that the game could be played at Real’s Bernabéu Stadium instead and offered 18 December as their preferred option. A Spanish Football Federation statement read: “The decision of the competition committee has come after analysing in recent days the proposals of both clubs, which were invited to agree on a date and which have agreed on December 18 for the celebration of the postponed match.” The original fixture was postponed following mass protests in Barcelona after nine Catalan political leaders were given lengthy prison sentences for their roles in the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. Barça had urged the federation to allow the game to go ahead, saying it had “the utmost confidence in the civilised and pacifist attitude of its members and fans who always express themselves in exemplary fashion at Camp Nou”. The Catalan club confirmed the rearranged date in a statement on their official website, saying: “We have a date for El Clásico. The Spanish Football Federation’s competition committee has officially announced on Wednesday that the first game between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid this season, originally scheduled for 26 October, will now be taking place on Wednesday 18 December at Camp Nou, the date that FC Barcelona originally proposed a week ago.”
