Leicester City have said they are “appalled” by racist comments directed towards midfielder Hamza Choudhury on Twitter. The 22-year-old was the target of a torrent of racist abuse following a tackle that injured the Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah during the Foxes’ 2-1 defeat at Anfield. A Leicester spokesman said: “We are appalled by these comments, which the club has reported to the police and to the social media platform on which they were made. “Discriminatory behaviour has no place in football or in society and we will seek the strongest possible course of action to be taken against those responsible.” The tackle also drew legitimate criticism after the game, with Jürgen Klopp referencing another bad challenge made by Choudhury in August, which left Matt Ritchie injured. “It’s a challenge I really don’t understand,” said Klopp. “It’s dangerous as hell. I don’t want to cause the boy any problems but he has to calm down. This is not the first situation like this.” Salah hobbled out of Anfield after the match with the club still awaiting news on the extent of his ankle injury.
