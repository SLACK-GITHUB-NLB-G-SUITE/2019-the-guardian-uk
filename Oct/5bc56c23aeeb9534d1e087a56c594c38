Test opener David Warner has posted his 29th first-class century after bouncing back to form in NSW’s Sheffield Shield clash with Queensland at the Gabba. Warner scored a sparkling 125 in an innings that featured 18 boundaries to put NSW into a strong position. NSW moved to 249-6 on Friday’s second day, in reply to Queensland’s 153, with Warner’s knock influential before rain stopped play. The Blues were struggling at 14-3 before Warner dragged them out of trouble. Nick Bertus (53) also played an important hand, with Peter Nevill (18no) and Sean Abbott (20 not out) looking to increase the lead. Warner endured a disastrous Ashes campaign in which he averaged a meagre 9.5 with the bat but his form in his first match since the Ashes will be a huge relief for national selectors. Warner’s knock was finally brought undone by Test teammate Marnus Labuschagne, who produced a sharp-turning legspinner to trap the star opener plumb lbw. NSW’s reply started disastrously after Daniel Hughes (6), Steve Smith (0) and Moises Henriques (0) all failed. Warner’s rescue mission comes at a perfect time – not only for NSW but also himself as he attempts to hold onto his Test spot. The 32-year-old became the first batsman in Test history to be dismissed for single figures eight times during one series during a disastrous Ashes campaign. It was also the lowest return for an opener playing all 10 innings in a five-Test series. But Warner’s big knock against Queensland looks certain to secure his spot for the start of Australia’s Test summer, which begins on 21 November against Pakistan in Brisbane.
