The Duke of Sussex has described the emotional impact of walking in his mother’s footsteps, and how dealing with her death is a “wound that festers”, in a new ITV documentary. In an interview with ITV News at Ten anchor Tom Bradby, Prince Harry was asked how he felt retracing the steps of Diana, Princess of Wales, during the recent southern Africa tour with the Duchess of Sussex, 22 years after his mother’s death. He was asked: “Do you feel at peace in a way yet? Or is it still a sort of wound that festers?” Prince Harry replied: “I think probably a wound that festers. I think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back, so in that respect it’s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.” He added: “Being here now 22 years later trying to finish what she started will be incredibly emotional but everything that I do reminds me of her. But as I said, with the role, with the job, with the sort of pressures that come with that, I get reminded of the bad stuff, unfortunately.” The ITV crew followed the couple throughout the official tour for the one-hour film, to be broadcast on Sunday at 9pm on ITV. During the tour Harry launched an unprecedented attack on sections of the tabloid press as it was announced that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, was suing the Mail on Sunday over an allegation that it unlawfully published a private letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. In the statement Prince Harry compared his wife’s treatment with that of Diana’s, accusing British tabloids of a “ruthless campaign” against Meghan. He has also issued legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking.
