Maybe the best way to grasp what happened on Wednesday night and what it meant is to pause it and watch it back again frame by frame, a thousand things in a single shot, a thousand more in the next. Look at Celta de Vigo: you can actually pinpoint the second where their hearts rip in half. It’s the same second when life floods back into Betis. The clock shows 89.47 and the ball drops to Nabil Fekir, near the penalty spot. Stop it there: everyone’s looking at him, close. Only Iago Aspas isn’t in the area. Of those that are, only Stanislav Lobotka isn’t on him. Just to his right is Sergio Bermejo. The rest stand before him and salvation: Hugo Mallo, Néstor Araujo, Joseph Aidoo, David Juncà, Gabriel Fernández, Fran Beltrán, Brais Mendez and Rubén Blanco. In front of him, a line of five men. Behind them, two more. And behind them, another. Press play and somehow Fekir’s shot finds a way through them all and into the net. Pause it again. Aspas, in shot now, pulls his shirt to his face. Juncà slips to his knees, arms out. Blanco turns to the sky. Lobotka is bent over, staring at the ground, beaten. They all are. Now let it run. Let Fekir run, faster than he thought possible in those final desperate, exhausting minutes. Teammates chase. Turn the volume up, the noise. Pointing, Fekir sprints towards the touchline. He slides to his knees and into the wide, welcoming arms of the Betis manager Joan Francesc Ferrer ‘Rubí’ and four of his staff, led by the goalkeeper coach Diego Tuero. Emerson bundles in, E Royal on his shirt, and then Joaquín. The physio is there, in blue rubber gloves. Rubí’s face looks like it might crack open, holding Fekir. In a green tracksuit behind, the assistant Jaume Torras looks like he’s seen something. Maybe it’s Fran Escribá, the Celta coach, a little further down the line. What a photo https://t.co/Wdd0piKknI It’s all there in an extraordinary photo, which is soon shared on the Betis coaching staff’s mobile group: a portrait of what football is and what they had been through together, a picture of suffering but also hope. Relief, maybe revival. Something to hold on to the way they hold on to each other. A similar shot is being prepared for the cover of Estadio Deportivo and every one of the sports dailies do the same, the pictures in Marca, AS, Mundo Deportivo and Sport all variations on the same theme. “This one is for you,” the headline on the front of Estadio Deportivo says. For Rubí. Betis v Celta was supposed to be the end, one way or other. Escribá and Rubí were under pressure, on the verge of the sack 11 weeks into the season, parallel lives that finally met. When the managers spoke about each other in the build-up, they were speaking about themselves, too. “These are two squads who aren’t where they could be. I’m convinced that both will end up more or less where they should be,” Rubí said. “In terms of potential, strength, both Betis and us are going to get out of it,” Escribá agreed. But as Diario de Sevilla put it: “Winning is the only way out” – and for the managers, especially. Most media were drawing on the Highlander legend: by the end, there could only be one. Celta and Betis weren’t supposed to be in this position: they were built for better things, European ambitions. “We’re suffering a scenario we didn’t expect,” the Betis striker Borja Iglesias said. “Both us and Celta are big teams with lots of potential and if we can get it right, we won’t have problems [with relegation].” But they weren’t getting it right. Celta couldn’t score and Betis couldn’t stop opponents scoring. At kick-off, they were 17th and 18th, level on nine points. Whoever won would pull clear of the relegation zone; whoever lost would be dragged in properly, a fight for survival. The pressure built, as much in the boardrooms as on the benches, which only ever makes it worse down on the touchline. Both clubs had already started to sound out replacements, and while nothing was done or decided, while there had been no real time to change things, both had gone back to what they knew: Celta had spoken to their former coach Eduardo Berizzo, Betis were even contemplating a return for Quique Setién – a baffling idea, given how bitter the end had been. This was an ultimatum, or so it goes. That is how it was set up, certainly. El Faro de Vigo summed it up: “Mission: save Escribá.” Only one man would be left standing, they said, but as the final minutes slipped away, you wondered if both would live to die another day. Or maybe that would be it for the pair of them. Betis scored first but Celta equalised. Celta were the better team too, dominant, yet Joel Robles stood before them. Time ticked away, heading towards a 1-1 draw that was damning but might delay the inevitable. Celta sought victory more; Betis, in the words of the commentator were a flan – wobbly, soft, “hanging on any way they can”. Rubí waved them forward but without much conviction. Then into the 90th minute, Aidoo – you don’t – made an unnecessary tackle on Diego Laínez, deep in the corner, and was punished. They all were, especially Escribá. The free-kick was taken, the ball crossed in and headed away but poorly, straight to Fekir – ready to deliver Rubí’s salvation and Escribá’s sentence. Left footed, he finished it, through that burgundy barrier. “The miracle of the Villamarín,” Marca called it. “Rubí’s Betis were sunk at the bottom of the swimming pool, chained to a chair and showing signs of drowning, their attempts to break free in vain,” Estadio Deportivo said, “but that was when, in a Hollywood ending, the French Houdini appeared. We’d hardly seen Fekir in the second half: he must have been preparing his new trick.” From somewhere, Fekir found enough energy to race to the touchline, everyone piling on, a picture that sums up sport. When finally the bodies broke, he kneeled, kissed the floor and prayed. Then he stood up, nodded and raised his thumbs. The verdict was in. There was no time for more. At the whistle, Rubí shook Escribá’s hand, a little apologetically. Aidoo stood, a lost look on his face. Hugo Mallo crouched, just staring into space. On the touchline, the reporter was waiting. “What a blow, right?” he asked when Mallo finally reached him. There was a prolonged, uncomfortably telling silence, Mallo’s eyes and mind somewhere else. “Yes, a big blow,” he mumbled eventually. Another question, another lost response. “I can’t find an explanation,” he said. “Football is cruel. It’s a pity.” Fekir's last-gasp winner sent the Benito Villamarin wild! 💚🎉📺 #RealBetisCelta pic.twitter.com/uhMiWWSEqj Betis’s fans were not fooled – there were whistles still, and chants for the board to resign – but their team had escaped and so had their manager. In celebration, they had expressed something at least, signs of life and community. “We embraced like that because we’re all together, players and coaching staff,” Emerson said. Feddal insisted: “We’re with the manager and the manager is with us. We’re doing good work, even if things aren’t coming off as we would like.” Now perhaps that work can continue, or perhaps not? Asked if this was a “match ball” saved, Rubí said he didn’t know; it wasn’t a question for him. He should at least make it to the Bernabéu on Saturday, maybe beyond. There is some willingness to believe in a coach who has done impressive things in his career, who might yet make this work, however bad it looks now, if only he can hold on. And this goal means there is a chance. Marca said Rubí had been “given an extra life, like in a video game”. “Fekir is Rubí’s lifesaver,” El País said. And it is his life, too. Rubí admits that football has cost him a lot, including his marriage. “You have a passion that can break families,” he has said. When he was at Benidorm, he left his three kids behind and didn’t get paid. After that, he went two years without coaching, unable to find a job, but then Girona turned up just when he had been ready to give it all up and go to work in the family travel agency. He had even bought himself a suit and tie but at the last minute, he was rescued. He didn’t need the suit then and he doesn’t need it now either. Not yet. • Once upon a time, Atlético 1-0 up meant game over. Not any more. And not when Lucas Pérez is around. Álvaro Morata opened the scoring and might have got a second, only to be denied by the first of two one-on-one saves from Fernando Pachecho, the goalkeeper who really should get talked about more. But Lucas scored an absolutely belting goal, turning away from one man, escaping another and bending a rocket of a shot into the far corner to secure a draw at Mendizorroza. That’s his fifth in as many games, the first Alavés player to do that since the magnificently named Wilson Alfredo Jones Rodríguez in 1953. As for Simeone he says he sees things “ever more clearly”. And what he sees doesn’t look good. • Two assists, two goals, both stupidly good and yet so very seen before, and two nutmegs – one of them with a pass. That Lionel Messi can play a bit, eh? • “I don’t think so,” Zidane said when he was asked if Real Madrid’s 5-0 win over Leganés was Madrid’s best game of the season, but it’s hard to think of a better one. In truth, it’s hard to think of many good ones. This one was, though: 22 shots, five goals by five different players, including Rodrygo and Jovic, and a very comfortable night. • Eh? That’s not supposed to happen, but it did. Levante beat Real Sociedad at Anoeta, the win set up by a superb dinked finish from Bardhi. Barcelona 5-1 Real Valladolid, Alavés 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid 5-0 Leganés, Real Betis 2-1 Celta Vigo, Athletic Bilbao 3-0 Espanyol, Real Sociedad 1-2 Levante, Valencia 1-1 Sevilla
