Mauricio Pochettino’s struggling side confirmed “they have not forgotten how to play football”, as Jürgen Klopp put it, when they demolished Red Star Belgrade in midweek but a reunion with Liverpool may reopen insecurities. Tottenham faced Liverpool three times last season and lost on each occasion, with no reminder needed of what happened in the Champions League final 148 days ago. Anfield will provide plenty, however. The leaders are unbeaten in 44 league games at home and Spurs have won only once in their last 25 league visits.
