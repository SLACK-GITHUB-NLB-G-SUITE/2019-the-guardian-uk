Last year I began working as a financial dominatrix, after discovering that some men are aroused by relinquishing control of their finances to someone they communicate with via a webcam. I don’t do real-life meets, and it’s not about sex, even though my clients get turned on. Usually they are men in high-powered jobs who want the opposite of the authority they have at work. They like handing over control by transferring money to me, and being told they are worthless, pathetic pigs. One client asked me to blackmail him by taking photos of him and then giving me the numbers of his work and wife. I told him, “You’ll have to pay me or I’ll use these photos against you.” I could see that he was getting a kick out of it. I’ve learned to go with the flow, and nothing shocks me any more, although I refuse requests to refer to a client’s race or religion. Potential clients need to send me money via PayPal first, so I know they are genuine, otherwise I could spend two hours talking to someone and not see a penny. Some buy me shoes, jewellery and lingerie. Friends and family have been supportive. But when I tell potential partners what I do, they lose interest, which is difficult. I’ve been single for four years, but I’m happy on my own and I won’t change for anybody. I enjoy pleasing people and allowing the domineering side of my personality to come out. In daily life, I try to avoid confrontations and would never insult anyone, but as a financial dominatrix I feel empowered. • As told to Georgina Lawton Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.
