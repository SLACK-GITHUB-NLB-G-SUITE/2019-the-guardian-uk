When Eminem claimed on his 2018 song The Ringer that he had been visited by the Secret Service over lyrics perceived to be a threat to Donald Trump, it was easy to assume he was using a bit of characteristic poetic license. “But I know at least he’s heard it / cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service to meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin’ him / or ask if I’m linked to terrorists,” he rapped. But documents obtained by Buzzfeed this week through a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that he was in fact speaking from direct experience, and that the agency interviewed him in December of 2017. In question were lyrics from his 2017 album Revival, among other disparaging remarks he had made about the president and his family. “Donald Duck’s on as the Tonka Truck in the yard. But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?… Cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl, that motherfuckin’ baton twirler that got dumped in the pond. Second murder with no recollection of it …” he rapped on Fame. “This is not the first time MATHERS made threatening comments towards POTUS and his family,” the documents stated. “In June 2017, MATHERS freestyled comments that were threatening in nature towards POTUS.” Strangely, the agency seems to have been alerted to the lyrics on Revival by an employee of the tabloid TMZ, just hours after they had published an article about Eminem’s criticism of Trump. “I want to know if your agency is investigating Eminem for his threatening lyrics about first daughter Ivanka Trump,” the concerned citizen at TMZ asked. After meeting with the musician and his lawyers, the Secret Service ultimately declined to refer to matter to federal prosecutors.
