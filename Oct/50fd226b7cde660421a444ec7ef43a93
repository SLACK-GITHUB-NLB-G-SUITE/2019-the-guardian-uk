The singer-songwriter Sia Furler has disclosed that she has the chronic pain disease Ehlers-Danos syndrome, and told others suffering from pain ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù. In a Tweet late Friday night, Sia said: ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going. Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù Hey, I'm suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going. Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone. The Australian artist often wears a dramatic wig to obscure her face and to protect her privacy. She is best known for her tracks Chandelier and Cheap Thrills, but has also written more than 100 pop songs for artists including Rihanna, Beyonc√©, Britney Spears and Adele. Sia has been open about her issues with drug and alcohol addiction, but has previously not spoken about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the public. There are several forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects connective tissues. Symptoms of the most common form of the syndrome include stretchy, fragile skin and overly flexible joints, according to the Mayo Clinic. At least 1 in 5,000 people worldwide have the syndrome, according to the US National Institute of Health. As of Saturday afternoon, more than 100,000 people had liked Sia‚Äôs tweet and many people who said they had the syndrome thanked her for bringing more awareness to the disease. The number of doctors/nurses who don‚Äôt understand or have any sort of compassion towards EDS, is crazy and upsetting. Chronic invisible illnesses are horrible and life changing and I hope that @Sia can bring more #EDSawareness for everyone who suffers with EDS ü¶ìüéóü¶ì https://t.co/ShIEMHXPbk
