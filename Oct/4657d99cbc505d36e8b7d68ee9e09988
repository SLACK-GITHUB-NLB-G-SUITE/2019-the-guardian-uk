Manly hooker Manase Fainu’s NRL future is in doubt after he was charged over a stabbing. Fainu will front court on Tuesday afternoon, where police will allege he produced a knife and stabbed another man at a church dance on Friday night. He has been charged with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, affray and recklessly cause grievous bodily harm in company. Fainu presented himself to NSW police at Liverpool on Tuesday morning, after an incident at a church dance festival on Friday night. The NRL’s integrity unit are aware of the incident and have at this stage left the investigation to NSW police. However it is likely the incident will land the 21-year-old in hot water under the NRL’s no-fault stand-down policy. Under the game’s laws, players charged with an offence that carries more than 11 years in prison are automatically stood down. The charge of wounding or previous bodily harm with intent carries with it a maximum sentence of 25 years under NSW law. Any such ban would come as a massive blow for the Sea Eagles, who released hooker Apisai Koroisau at the end of last season for Fainu to take the No 9 jersey. No other member of their squad has started in the position, with Zach Dockar-Clay the next best option through the lower grades. Michael Lichaa, Kurt Baptiste and Michael Lichaa are among the hookers without a contract for 2020. Both Manly and the NRL have been contacted for comment.
