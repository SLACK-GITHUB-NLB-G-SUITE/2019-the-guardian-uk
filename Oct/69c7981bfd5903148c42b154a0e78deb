Kanye West revealed he tried to ban premarital sex among people working on his new album. The controversial rapper and fashion designer is preparing for the highly anticipated unveiling of his latest album, Jesus Is King. Before its release, West sat down with Zane Lowe for his Apple Music Beats 1 show and looked back on his career. West revealed he was exposed to pornography from a young age and said he was addicted to sex following the death of his mother in 2007. “Some people drown themselves in drugs, and I drown myself in my addiction: sex,” he said. Discussing the production of Jesus Is King, West, who describes himself as a Christian, said he asked those working on the album not to have sex before marriage. He said: “There were times where I was asking people not to have premarital sex while they were working on the album. There were times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said, can you just work and focus on this? I thought if we could all focus and fast – families who pray together stay together.” West, who has attracted criticism for wearing a Maga (Make America Great Again) hat and saying he and Trump “are both dragon energy”, said he will not be forced into not sharing his opinions. “For the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God’s practical joke to all liberals. Like, ‘No! Not Kanye!’” he said. The 42-year-old also revealed plans for a future presidential run. He said: “There will be a time when I will be the president of the US and I will remember … any founder that didn’t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing.” In the same interview, West also referred to himself as “unquestionably, undoubtedly the greatest human artist of all time”.
