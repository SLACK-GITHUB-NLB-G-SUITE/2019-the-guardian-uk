According to Morton, “Halloween is undoubtedly the most misunderstood of festivals”. All Hallows’ Eve (“hallow” comes from the Old English word hálga, or holy) precedes All Saints’ Day, celebrated by Roman Catholics on 1 November. But the origins of Halloween are also pagan. The Celts believed that the doors to the afterlife, known as Tir na tSamhraidh (the Land of Summer), opened on one night of the year, at Samhain. Samhain began at sunset on 31 October and it marked the end of summer, when crops were harvested and animals brought in for the winter. The Celtic festival’s “peculiar mix of harvest, rowdy celebration and fearful supernatural beliefs” shaped our Halloween. Even though Samhain was superseded by All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day (2 November), Halloween still retained “a pagan character”, combining sombre contemplation of death with fun and mischief-making, leading to the tradition of trick or treating which emerged a century ago in the US. Morton’s excellent history explores Halloween’s origins and traditions as well as its place in popular culture, such as John Carpenter’s “seminal slasher” film Halloween (1979). Condemned by some Christian groups as a dangerous celebration of “the Devil’s Birthday” but embraced as far afield as Hong Kong and Japan, this “most demonised of days” is, she argues, “on the verge of blossoming into a global subculture”. • Trick or Treat is published by Reaktion (£9.99).
