I don’t entirely buy the scepticism of some of your correspondents about Jeremy Corbyn as a leader (Letters, 7 October). Clement Attlee was a rather colourless leader, and indeed it was uncertain in 1945 as to whether he or Herbert Morrison would lead Labour. Churchill was anticipated to be a shoo-in. How far are today’s opinion polls concentrating on the popularity of policies and how far on the leader?David RedshawGravesend, Kent • As I reach my 81st birthday this month, I realised that the answer to the clue “elderly” in the quick crossword (7 October) would apply to me. But I was unprepared to find that the solution was “over the hill”. You would not allow use of offensive language about race or disability, so why should this be acceptable?Judith AbbsLondon • I too have been in touch with the princess via a psychic (Bonham Carter says she got Margaret’s blessing via psychic for her Crown role, 7 October) and received a very different message. She said Kathy Burke should have got the part and that her smoking as Waynetta distinguished her from all other auditioners.Stephen FarrerLondon • Growing up in a Welsh household our meals were, from lunchtime onwards: cinio (lunch, a light meal); te (tea, the main meal; and swper (a light snack before bed). Except for Sunday when we had cinio Dydd Sul (Sunday), a substantial meal that kept you going until supper time (Letters, 7 October).Emyr OwenLlanfairfechan, Conwy • Your obituary (7 October) says that before Ginger Baker, the drummer was the “quiet one sitting at the back”. That is not quite true of Buddy Rich, Sandy Nelson and others.Dave AllenPortsmouth • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
