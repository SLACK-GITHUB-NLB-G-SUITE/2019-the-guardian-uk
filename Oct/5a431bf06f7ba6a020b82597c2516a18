In the memories of many football fans, the 1990 World Cup in Italy was one of the greatest ever staged. England were half decent, Pavarotti made everyone fall in love with opera, Roger Milla danced around the corner flag, Paul Gascoigne cried and – to paraphrase Gary Lineker’s famous quip – at the end of it all the Germans won. But apparently this rottweiler wasn’t so enthused by the whole spectacle when Argentina, featuring the great Maradona, faced Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals. With the dog’s jaws clamped around an Adidas Etrusco Unico football and its handler chuckling to himself, this frame goes to show that sometimes the best sporting images aren’t of the action itself. Incidentally, Argentina won the match on penalties, despite Maradona’s effort being saved.
