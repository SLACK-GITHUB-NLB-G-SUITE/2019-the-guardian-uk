Adrian Chiles (Wearing glasses as a teen was awful. In middle age, it’s worse, G2, 17 October) should really have done some homework before rushing into print. For a start, middle-aged eyesight issues are not longsightedness but presbyopia, which is an increasing inability to focus close-up due to a stiffening of the lenses. Longsightedness is something else altogether. But I have good news for Adrian. He doesn’t need to give up on his contact lenses – just ask his optician for a new prescription for monovision, whereby he can have one eye for close up and the other for distant vision. From years of personal experience, I can assure him it works.
