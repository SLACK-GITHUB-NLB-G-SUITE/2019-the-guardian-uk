Barely had the announcement of the general election been made than the online campaigns had kicked off – launching, as these things do, with videos on social media. The indisputable winner of the first round is Labour, which not only has the best backing track (Invincible by US rapper Jonezen), but has also racked up the most views – 1.2m at the time of writing – by a very large margin. The ad starts with Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour party leader and his promise that things “can and would change” and gives a potted history of what has been achieved by the opposition over the last four years. Labour’s video focuses on the upset of the previous election, showing pundits and newspapers predicting a landslide victory for May, when instead she was shoved into minority government. A grab of Jon Snow saying “We the media, the pundits, the experts know nothing” is surely something Labour is desperately hoping will prove true this time around, given the party is sitting 10 points behind the Conservatives. The General Election has just been called.It's time for real change. pic.twitter.com/aiUwhxm5K6 “Let’s get Brexit done,” Boris Johnson begins in the Conservatives’ video. The clip leads with his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester earlier this year, before Johnson outlines his party’s promises including “fantastic full fibre broadband, sprouting in every household”. “We are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity,” says the prime minister in one of his classic flourishes. The video (at time of writing at 33k views) closes with the party’s campaign slogan “Get Brexit done”. #BackBoris to get Brexit done.🇬🇧 Only @BorisJohnson can take our country forward and deliver on the people's priorities.#GE2019 pic.twitter.com/3pTkzI6vFy The Lib Dems too seem to have hit upon the campaign slogan “Bring it on”. The party is yet to launch a campaign video but Jo Swinson posted a campaign meme showing actor Gabrielle Union, in cheerleading regalia, saying “Bring it”. The meme comes from the cheerleading film Bring It On and it is perhaps unsurprising that Swinson has aligned herself with Union’s character, the leader of the underdog team, the East Compton Clovers, standing up to the wealthy elite, cheating national champions the Toros. Though whether they’ll be able to deliver a victory as the (spoiler alert!) Clovers do is another question. #GE2019 pic.twitter.com/HGNf1fd5wt The SNP have a very short video (36k views at time of writing) showing the top of Boris Johnson’s head. “Time to choose,” says the voiceover. “Scotland’s future in your hands? Or those of Boris Johnson?” before an appeal for people to register to vote. 🗳 Parliament has voted for a general election. People in Scotland will have a choice, to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands or in those of Boris Johnson.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Register to vote and invite your friends to do the same: https://t.co/7Rfhd84RqK pic.twitter.com/VSKuPJgjUo And the Greens? They’ve got a video (languishing at 19k views at time of writing) that should not be watched by anyone who suffers from motion sickness. It shows Green party leader Jonathan Bartley walking through the streets as he promises “the biggest Green campaign ever”. It is without the whizzbangery of the larger parties’ videos, but is heartfelt.
