Callum Hawkins, the Scottish marathon runner who prepared for the brutal heat of Doha by training in his garden shed stacked with heaters from Aldi, produced the race of his life to come close to a major shock at the world championships. The 27-year-old looked to be slipping back in the midnight marathon after two thirds of the race, dropping 33 seconds behind the leaders after 18 miles. But then he produced a surge to close - and then catch his rivals - with over a mile remaining. Hawkins wasn’t finished yet. He then made a bid for gold, driving hard and ahead of his four rivals. But it turned out they had just been biding their time. And within sight of the line three of them overtook him - which meant he had to settle for fourth, the same position as at the 2017 world championships in London. Lelisa Desisa took gold for Ethiopia in 2:10.40, with silver going to Geremew, four seconds back. Amos Kipruto of Kenya took bronze in 2:10.51, with Hawkins clocking 2:10:57. When it was put to the Scot that it was a phenomenal performance, especially in the high, 29-30C heat, his response was succinct. “Not quite phenomenal enough,” he said. “I’m gutted. Maybe I just gave too much in the middle stages. But I couldn’t do any more.” “I felt great with two laps to go, but I knew I didn’t have a huge kick,” he added. “I was just trying to burn them off. I really wanted that medal and that’s what I trained for but it wasn’t to be on the night.” Hawkins proved, however, that he could handle the heat after the images of him collapsing with heatstroke and dehydration at last year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia went viral - and he will be hopeful of improving on his ninth-placed marathon finish in Rio at next year’s Olympics.
