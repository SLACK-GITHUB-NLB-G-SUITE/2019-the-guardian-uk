Like cranberry woo woos or a game of Twister, blondies know how to get a party started. They’re the ultimate fuss-free, please-all, bung-it-in-the-oven treat. The batter should, in my opinion, be treated as merely a vehicle in which you can add whatever brings you joy. I have gone full American girl scout with mine, adding peanut butter, jam and a little chocolate, because the combination just works, but you could add whatever floats your (blondie) boat. Prep 10 minCook 1 hrMakes 16 4 ½ tbsp milled chia seeds160g flavourless coconut oil2 tsp vanilla extract 300g caster sugar 200g plain flour1 tsp baking powder2 big pinches flaky sea salt 150g vegan dark chocolate, roughly chopped75g smooth peanut butter75g raspberry jam Line a 20cm square tin with baking paper, and heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a small bowl, mix the chia seeds with 275ml water and set aside to soak. Put the coconut oil in a small pan set over a low heat, until melted, leave to cool a little, then stir in the vanilla extract. In a large bowl, mix the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt and chocolate until well combined. Add the bloomed chia seeds and cooled coconut oil, stir well until everything is combined, then blob the batter into the lined tin. Drop teaspoons of peanut butter and jam all over the surface, then swirl them into the batter with a skewer or cocktail stick. Bake for 40 minutes, until the blondies have a crisp top and just the faintest hint of a wobble. Leave to cool completely before slicing and eating, ideally with a cuppa.
