Bristol City came from behind to beat Charlton 2-1 thanks to a Josh Brownhill stoppage-time winner in a thriller at Ashton Gate. The midfielder raced on to a long ball through the middle before firing past Dillon Phillips in the eighth minute of added time. The win moves Lee Johnson’s side fourth. Charlton had taken a 65th-minute lead when Macauley Bonne coolly slotted into an empty net. Substitute Famara Diedhiou levelled 10 minutes later, but he was then shown an 86th-minute red card. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s fantastic form continued as he scored a hat-trick in Fulham’s 3-2 win at home to Luton. Dan Potts and Kazenga LuaLua twice pulled Luton within a goal, but they ultimately left empty-handed. Josh Magennis scored and was sent off as Hull condemned Nottingham Forest to consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win at the City Ground. Jon Toral created both goals on his first league start for 17 months, with Magennis and Jarrod Bowen the beneficiaries. Matty Cash pulled one back for the hosts before Magennis saw red, but Forest were unable to force an equaliser – although they were denied what looked a clear penalty when Reece Burke brought down Sammy Ameobi. Graeme Shinnie slammed home a stoppage-time winner as Derby secured their third successive victory at Pride Park against an unfortunate Wigan side. Derby looked a side bereft of ideas and confidence for the majority of the game against a team with an abysmal away record. But in the second minute of time added on, Shinnie popped up to drive home an unstoppable shot from 15 yards. The pressure on the Middlesbrough manager, Jonathan Woodgate, intensified after a frustrating goalless draw at Huddersfield that extended his side’s winless run to six matches. Boro have still not won away all season and the struggling Teessiders have won twice in 14 games in all competitions under Woodgate.
