Two million people have asked to stay in the UK after Brexit under the government’s EU settlement scheme, latest figures show. The number of applications received by 30 September is equivalent to one in six EU citizens in the UK and included nationals and relatives from the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Home Office data published on Wednesday said. More than half a million applications (520,600) were received in September alone. It is believed the continuing threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has prompted the rush of applications, even though EU citizens and their families will have until 31 December 2020 to apply even if the UK crashes out. The figures are classed as experimental because the scheme is still in the testing phase and not fully developed so should be “treated with caution”, the Home Office paper warned. The scheme asks applicants to prove their identity, demonstrate they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions.
