We came up with the original version of this cocktail at the Met Bar in London in the late 1990s. It’s now the site of Gridiron, and I’ve renamed the drink and put it on the restaurant’s cocktail list in homage to its former incarnation. Serves 1 60ml vodka – we use Ketel One 45ml pineapple juice (not from concentrate) – we use Eager’s 100% cloudy pressed 15ml fresh lime juice 7.5ml pure cane sugar syrup – we use Monin, which is widely available1 wedge pineapple, to garnish (optional) Pour everything into a shaker, add a good handful of ice, shake hard and double strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a pineapple wedge on the rim, if you wish, and serve immediately. • Ben Reed, cocktailcredentials.com
