Mohamed Salah has been passed fit by Liverpool’s medical staff for the team’s Champions League trip to Genk on Wednesday, but Joël Matip and Trent Alexander-Arnold will sit out the game with injuries. The Egyptian has not played since picking up an ankle knock in Liverpool’s match against Leicester on 5 October, missing his country’s friendly with Botswana as well as Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, which brought an end to Liverpool’s 17-game winning streak. He will return to contention in a squad that will not feature either of Alexander-Arnold, who is sidelined with illness, or Matip, who has a knee problem. Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren have both travelled to Belgium, with either able to deputise for Matip at the heart of defence, while Alexander-Arnold is likely to be replaced at right-back by James Milner. Wednesday’s game in Belgium is one Liverpool will want to use to reassert their authority in the competition they won in June, with their two games so far having been a 2-0 defeat by Napoli in Italy and a fraught 4-3 win against RB Salzburg. They go into the game second in Group E, level on points with Salzburg and one point behind leaders Napoli.
