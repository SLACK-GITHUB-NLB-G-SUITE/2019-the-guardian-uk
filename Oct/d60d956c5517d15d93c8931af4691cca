The government is continuing to run adverts warning the public to prepare for Brexit on 31 October, despite the prime minister effectively accepting that it is now impossible to meet this deadline. The Get Ready for Brexit marketing campaign was launched last month, with adverts running across television, radio, newspapers, online and on billboards around the UK. Almost all of the adverts, paid for using public funds, prominently state that the UK will definitely be leaving at the end of October and many feature a calendar counting down to the end of the month. Despite the expectation that Brexit will once again be delayed by up to three months, a government spokesperson confirmed that the “campaign is still live” and spending will continue. It could take some time to redesign the hundreds of different adverts in all formats that prominently feature the 31 October date. Decisions will also have to be taken on whether to bin recently produced marketing material emphasising that it is the date the UK will definitely leave the EU. The advertising campaign has been widely reported to cost about £100m of public funds, although actual figures have not been released by the government. Doubts have been raised within the advertising industry about the likelihood of spending that much in just two months, given major British companies such as Tesco spend less than £75m on traditional advertising in an entire year. However, the wider Get Ready public information campaign has expanded to include stalls on British high streets, other forms of marketing, and adverts in local languages across Europe, potentially pushing up the cost. On Wednesday the UK embassy in Belgium shared photos of a Brexit information point it had opened at a service station under the title “Soyez prêt pour le Brexit,” while some baffled Spanish users of Spotify say they have been bombarded with the adverts – potentially in an attempt to reach ex-pat Britons living in the country.

On Thursday night the i ran a story claiming the campaign had been pulled, but has since deleted the article, noting it “did not meet our editorial standards”. Earlier this month a report from the National Audit Office suggested the Get Ready campaign could be too late to prepare the public and businesses for a no-deal Brexit: “At this late stage and with ongoing uncertainty about the prospect of no deal on 31 October, this may have limited impact.”
