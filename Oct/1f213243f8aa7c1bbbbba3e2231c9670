Neil Harris has stepped down as Millwall’s manager after more than four and a half years in charge. He leaves with the club 18th in the Championship, five points above the relegation zone. Harris, Millwall’s all-time leading scorer, oversaw the club’s promotion to the second tier in 2017 and led them to two FA Cup quarter-finals. His assistant, David Livermore, has also departed and the coach Adam Barrett will take charge of Saturday’s game at home to Leeds. Millwall’s chairman, John Berylson, said Harris was leaving “with the best wishes of everyone” connected with the club. Harris took charge in March 2015, initially on a caretaker basis, and was appointed on a permanent basis the following month, a day after relegation to League One. He was the seventh longest-serving manager across the Football League and Premier League. “I would like to place on record my sincere gratitude to Neil for all of his hard work, commitment, determination and inarguable success as manager of this great football club,” Berylson told Millwall’s website. “During his time in charge we have achieved so much and so many of his greatest moments as manager will live long in the memory of all Millwall fans fortunate to have seen and enjoyed them. “Neil’s achievements ensure that he is listed alongside some of the club’s greatest-ever managers, furthering his legendary standing at Millwall.”
