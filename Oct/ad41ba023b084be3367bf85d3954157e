Tiger Woods equalled Sam Snead’s record of 82 PGA Tour titles when he won the Zozo Championship in Japan by three shots from local favourite Hideki Matsuyama. Bad weather meant the leaders had to finish on Monday with Woods having seven holes left of his fourth round. It was the second title of the year for Woods, who won the Masters in April, his 15th major. Snead, who died in 2002 aged 89, won the last of his titles in 1965. Woods won his first title in 1996 in Las Vegas, with his first major coming at the Masters the following year. Woods, who has had four back surgeries, said: “This was a big win. It’s just crazy. It’s a lot. I’ve been consistent most of my career. Today was one of those days when I was able to pull it out.”
