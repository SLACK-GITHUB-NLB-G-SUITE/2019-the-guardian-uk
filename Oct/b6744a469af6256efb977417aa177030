According to former Guardian environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”. Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring. If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you. When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?
