One man is dead and another, believed to be an Irish tourist, is in a critical condition after a hang-gliding accident on the New South Wales north coast. Emergency services were called to the Pat Morton lookout at Lennox Head near Byron Bay about midday on Wednesday after reports of a crash. A man, 67, believed to be an experienced hang-gliding instructor, died at the scene. His 26-year-old passenger, reportedly an Irish national, was treated by paramedics before being winched off a cliff by helicopter and flown to Gold Coast University hospital, where he remains in a critical condition. Ambulance officials said they believed the two men had fallen from the hang-glider before it crashed. A NSW aAmbulance inspector, Greg Powell, called it “an extremely complex rescue” because of the terrain and location. “Patient safety and care is paramount but we also need to ensure our own safety during these types of operations,” he said. “We always do everything we can to try and get the best patient outcome, but unfortunately, in this instance there was nothing more we could do. “It was an extremely tragic accident and understandably everyone involved is devastated.” Bystanders managed to reach the two men and began CPR before paramedics arrived, and Powell said they should be commended. “All the emergency services worked closely as a team and are supporting each other.” The Sports Aviation Federation of Australia is assisting police with inquiries and a report will be prepared for the coroner. The lookout about 20km south of Byron Bay is a popular hang-gliding spot.
