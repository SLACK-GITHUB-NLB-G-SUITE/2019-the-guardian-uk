Frank Lampard has identified Fikayo Tomori’s strong work ethic as a major factor behind the Chelsea defender’s inclusion in the England squad for the first time. Tomori has impressed since his Chelsea debut in August and Lampard, who had the 21-year-old on loan at Derby County last season, praised his focus after the call-up for England’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. “At Derby he became very popular in the dressing room and with the fans,” Chelsea’s manager said. “He was player of the year. The progression was huge but the main thing I saw in him was work ethic. He quietly goes about his business. Everything you ask him to do he tries to do and more. Physically he is great. But he is one of those when you are doing sprinting or some heavy running early season, which we were doing, you could see every day he is nailed on. “When you want to do a particular training session, something quite simple but takes focus, he is ready to go. That has really shown itself in his performances since he stepped into the team. I put trust in him early in the season – I think that was obvious with the way the pre-season went with the centre-backs. At the moment, he has really delivered.” Lampard said that Tomori was not the finished article, pointing to the error that almost cost Chelsea victory against Lille in the Champions League on Wednesday, and he stressed that his players cannot let international recognition go to their heads. England have also called up Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Mason Mount. Chelsea travel to Southampton on Sunday with Lampard yet to decide whether N’Golo Kanté is ready to start twice in one week. The Frenchman returned from a hamstring injury against Lille and has struggled with various knocks this season. Lampard added that he has chosen Jorginho as vice-captain to César Azpilicueta. “Jorginho is a character and a driver,” he said. “It is very evident to see on the pitch.”
