A man believed to be a fugitive suspected of killing his wife and four children has been arrested after eight years on the run. French police have said that Police Scotland officers in Glasgow detained a man on Friday, reportedly named Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes. Scottish police did not give details of his identity, but Reuters said a French police source confirmed that Dupont de Ligonnes had been arrested. He has been the subject of an international arrest warrant after his wife Agnes, 48, and their children, Arthur, 20, Thomas, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, went missing in April 2011. Their bodies were later found buried at the family home in Nantes, France, having been shot. As the only family member not located, he became the chief suspect. Police Scotland confirmed that a man was arrested at Glasgow airport in connection with a European arrest warrant, and that attempts are being made to confirm his identity. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “On Friday 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow airport and remains in police custody in connection with a European arrest warrant issued by the French authorities. “Inquiries are ongoing to confirm his identity and we continue to liaise with our colleagues in the relevant agencies.” French media reported that the man arrested was identified by his fingerprints after a tip-off that he was heading to Scotland.
