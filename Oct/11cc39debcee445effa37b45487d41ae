Andy Murray will make his return to the Davis Cup for the first time since 2016 at the finals in Madrid in November. Leon Smith has announced four of his five-man team – the singles players Murray and Dan Evans, alongside the doubles pairing of Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski. The GB captain will choose between Cameron Norrie and Kyle Edmund, who is on an eight-match losing streak and has fallen from No 14 to No 75 in the world, for the fifth spot. Murray had already stated his intention to play in the finals and his soaring form, topped off by Sunday’s stunning victory over Stan Wawrinka to win the European Open in Antwerp, ensured his place in the team seven singles tournaments into his comeback from hip surgery. GB, who were given a wildcard for the revamped finals, face the Netherlands and Kazakhstan in the group stage on 20 and 21 November. The finals will have 18 nations competing across six groups on hard courts at the Caja Mágica in Madrid. The group winners – as well as the two second-placed teams with the best records – progress to the quarter-finals, with the semi-finals and final on 23 and 24 November. Murray, whose win on Sunday was his first title in more than two years, continues to be surprised at his rapid improvement. His goals were considerably less when the former world No 1 sat down with his team to plan for a four-week run of tournaments in Zhuhai, Beijing, Shanghai and Antwerp. “I just want to try to be competitive. I want to feel like when I’m on the court I’m not getting smashed, that I’m making it difficult for them and competing as best I could,” he said. “I wasn’t thinking I’m going to win tournaments or I’m going to be beating guys like Stan Wawrinka and Matteo Berrettini and pushing guys like Fabio Fognini close. This has come as a surprise to me and my team.”
