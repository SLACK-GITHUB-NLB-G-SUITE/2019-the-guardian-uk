Andy Murray won his first ATP Tour match in Europe for 16 months as he continued his encouraging return from hip surgery. The former world No 1, making his first appearance at the European Open in Antwerp, battled past the Belgian wild card Kimmer Coppejans 6-4, 7-6 (4). Murray, now up to 243 in the world following four recent wins in China, was given a stern test by the world No 158. It was Murray’s first victory on European soil since beating Stan Wawrinka at Eastbourne in July 2018 and he will next face the eighth seed Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay or the Bolivian Hugo Dellien in the last 16. Feliciano López, Murray’s doubles partner on his comeback at Queen’s Club this year, beat another Briton, Cameron Norrie. The veteran Spaniard claimed the only break of serve in the fifth game of the second set and went on to record a 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory after an hour and 29 minutes. Despite the defeat, Norrie will become the British No 2 on Monday behind Dan Evans, with the defending champion, Kyle Edmund, set to drop outside the top 70 after failing to qualify.
