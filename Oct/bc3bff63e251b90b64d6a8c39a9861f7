Marizanne Kapp took the fourth hat-trick in WBBL history to spearhead Sydney Sixers to a convincing eight-wicket victory over Melbourne Stars at Hurstville Oval. The South African seamer tore through the Stars’ tail on Saturday with her last three deliveries in the 19th over, skittling Madeline Penna and Nicola Hancock before trapping Holly Ferling leg before. “I was actually really happy we bowled first,” Kapp said. “I felt it was a slow wicket. It was not my best bowling, to be honest, but I’ll take it.” Kapp remained stony-faced while her Sixers teammates celebrated wildly as the Stars suffered a collapse, losing eight wickets for 19 runs. They had started promisingly at 77-1 before finishing on 107-9, which the Sixers reeled in with 17 balls to spare. Kapp’s wife, teammate and fellow South African Dane van Niekerk, who was the last Sixers player to take a hat-trick, snared 2-18. The other two WBBL hat-tricks belong to Gemma Triscari and Amy Satterthwaite. Another South African, Mignon du Preez (44), was the only Stars batter to get going after skipper Elyse Villani had struggled for timing at the beginning of the afternoon with a painstaking 14. When du Preez departed after being stranded mid-pitch, the Stars went into freefall. In reply, Alyssa Healy (27) belted two sixes to start the chase aggressively and Ash Gardner (32) continued Healy’s early work before holing out. Skipper Ellyse Perry (39 not out) dropped the anchor early before branching out late, calmly pacing a run chase that was never in doubt.
