Bulgarian police have made six arrests in the aftermath of Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against England, which was twice halted for racist chanting. England won 6-0 but the game was marred by home fans making Nazi salutes and subjected some of the English players to racist chanting. On Tuesday the Bulgarian football president, Borislav Mihaylov, resigned from his post after being told to do so by the prime minister, Boyko Borissov. The fallout from the game continued on Wednesday with the Interior Ministry releasing a statement saying that six people had been arrested. “A police operation is currently in action, with the aim of identifying the people who behaved inappropriately during the football game between the national teams of Bulgaria and England,” it read. Senior commissioner Georgi Hadzhiev, director of the Sofia police department, said: “Six people were detained so far and we’re searching for three more as we have collected evidence about their involvement in the incidents.” Borissov, in a strongly worded message on Facebook, said: “It is unacceptable for Bulgaria, which is one of the most tolerant countries in the world – and people of different ethnicities and religions live in peace – to be associated with racism and xenophobia.” The Bulgaria manager, Krasimir Balakov, said on the night that he had not heard the racist chanting but on Tuesday offered an apology. “I strongly condemn any act of racism – it is a form of prejudice coming from the past and should be eradicated,” he said. “Considering there was racist abuse last night, in my role as Bulgaria manager, I would like to apologise to the England players and everyone who was offended.”
