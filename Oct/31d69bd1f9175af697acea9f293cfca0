I learned a lot of physical literacy at school. I learned that sport is for the kids who could be winners, like Dina Asher-Smith (‘You could be Dina’: teach children physical literacy, says Sport England, 5 October). I learned that if you’re not one of those golden kids, sport will be humiliating. I also learned the lie quoted at the end of the piece: “if you have the determination to succeed, you could be Katarina [Johnson-Thompson], you could be Dina” (so if you’re not a winner, it’s because you’re a slacker – nothing to do with your genetics, health, social capital etc). This is the sort of thing that puts ordinary kids off sport for life.Hilary CarlenBrookmans Park, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
