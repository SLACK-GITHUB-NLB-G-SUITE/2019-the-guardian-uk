Fig season on the continent is all but over for another year, but you can make it stretch just that little bit longer by investing in a bottle of quality fig liqueur. Mind you, if you ask me, this cocktail makes damned fine drinking at any time of year. Serves 1 40ml gin – we use Portobello Road 20ml fig liqueur – we use Esprit de Figues10ml maraschino cherry liqueur25ml lemon juice15ml sugar syrup1 thin strip lemon zest, with no pith attached, to garnish Put everything bar the lemon zest in a cocktail shaker, add a large handful of ice and shake well. Fine-strain the liquid into a chilled martini glass, add the twist of lemon and serve. • Wesley Yeung, Darby’s, London SW11
