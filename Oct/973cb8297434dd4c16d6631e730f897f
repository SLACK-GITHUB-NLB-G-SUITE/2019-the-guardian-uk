Massimiliano Allegri has been learning English as the former Juventus and Milan manager targets a new role in the Premier League, with the Italian understood to be keen on taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjær should Manchester United sack the Norwegian. Allegri, who left Juventus at the end of last season after winning a fifth consecutive Serie A title, attended Tottenham’s Champions League fixture against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night and has been sounded out by several English clubs over the possibility of moving to the Premier League in the future. In particular, the 52-year-old is believed to have identified United as a potential employer should United decide to part company with Solskjær after the club made its worst start to a league campaign for 30 years. At this stage, it is understood that United have no intention of sacking a manager who signed a three-year contract in March but Allegri is expected to be on a two or three-man shortlist should they take action in the near future. Despite his departure, the former midfielder is still contractually tied to Juventus until 2020 but that is unlikely to affect any potential move to Old Trafford, with Allegri thought to be willing to take the job even if United do not qualify for next season’s Champions League.
