Mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor appeared in court on Friday over an alleged assault on a man in a Dublin pub in April. The 31-year-old Irish fighter stood at the back of the Dublin courtroom as his solicitor, Michael Staines, asked for the case to be adjourned until 1 November pending the disclosure of evidence. A policeman told the court that included CCTV footage. Judge Marie Keane asked the twice Ultimate Fighting Championship title-holder, dressed in a navy pattern suit, to appear again in three weeks’ time when he would be asked to enter a plea or seek a date for the case to be heard. McGregor was charged in a separate case in April 2018 with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief after police said he attacked a charter bus in New York carrying UFC fighters. He pleaded guilty to a reduced disorderly conduct charge in that case. McGregor has not fought since losing his UFC lightweight title to Khabib Nurmagomedov a year ago this week. He announced his ‘retirement from MMA’ in March.
