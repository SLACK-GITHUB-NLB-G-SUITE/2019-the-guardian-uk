Patrice O’Neal is my favourite comic EVER. His last special, Elephant in the Room, is everything standup should be: unapologetically funny, honest and poignant – especially when he’s talking about his illness. I sobbed like a baby when he died. Probably Taken 3 as it’s absolutely terrible. “Are those your teeth?” ( I have big teeth.) Under the age of about 11, I used to get designs shaved into the back of my head, as all young black boys did back then. One time, my mom asked a barber that I hadn’t been to before if he could give me the Nike swoosh logo. He didn’t really know how to do it and in the end he gave me just a big tick in the back of my head. People thought I had the Sure logo. I don’t dream because life to me is a dream … I’m dreaming right now … join me? “Rarse” – it’s a Jamaican swear word. I have said it a few times on TV and gotten away with it: “Thanks for having me, it’s an absolute rarse pleasure to be here.” My friend, comedian Masai Graham, has a joke: “My Jamaican nan wants to know why I love chocolate spread so much but mi Nutella.” Darren Harriott plays Wolverhampton, Thursday 24; Bradford, Friday 25 October; touring to 18 January
