AFC Wimbledon’s manager Wally Downes has been suspended from all football activity for 28 days and fined £3,000 after he admitted breaching betting rules. The Football Association said Downes was suspended until 14 November for placing bets on eight matches between November 2013 and July 2019. Downes was suspended indefinitely by Wimbledon in late September after being charged by the FA. His assistant Glyn Hodges has been in charge of first-team duties and the club said after Friday’s verdict that they would make a statement in due course. The FA said Downes placed five bets on football matches between 30 November 2013 and 30 January 2014, and three bets between 16 March 2019 and 12 July 2019.
