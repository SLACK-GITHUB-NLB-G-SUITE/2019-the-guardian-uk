Nobel prizes have always courted controversy: Milton Friedman’s for economics because he associated with Pinochet; letterists Harold Pinter, Orhan Pamuk and Doris Lessing were “overly political”; Aung San Suu Kyi’s peace prize causes outrage because of her silence over the Rohingya. But Peter Handke’s case is of a different order (Criticism of Nobel award for literature given to ‘genocide apologist’, 11 October).Frank PaiceNorwich • To my eternal shame, in 1985, on a visit to a school in California, I jumped to the wrong conclusion (I’m not a cleaner, I’m a black MP, G2, 9 October). When a middle-aged black man, jacketless and wearing a blue shirt with a large bunch of keys attached to his belt, walked in to the classroom, I thought he was the janitor. He was the superintendent. A valuable lesson learned.Jennifer HenleyLondon • Wonderful to read about the Hays family business taking over Thomas Cook shops (Report, 10 October). Also, interesting that the Hays family gave £1m to their employees when business was booming while Thomas Cook directors gave themselves bonuses of millions whether business was booming or not.Chris McGorriganRosside, Cumbria • Tom Kerridge’s justification for £32.50 turbot, chips and curry sauce (Report, 10 October) was next to a Morrisons ad offering two fish fillets for £2. I hope you did this on purpose.Peter LowthianMarlow, Buckinghamshire • Pudding, sweet or dessert (Letters, 11 October)? Anyone for “afters”?James HoneywoodHaslemere, Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
