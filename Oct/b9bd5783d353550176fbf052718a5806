Anfield will host a Women’s Super League game for the first time next month – and making the occasion particularly special, the fixture will be the Merseyside derby. Liverpool will take on their counterparts from Everton at Anfield on Sunday 17 November. The match will form part of the Football Association’s Women’s Football Weekend during what will be the next international break in the men’s game. “This is an historic moment for women’s football on Merseyside,” said Peter Moore, Liverpool’s chief executive and chairman of the women’s team. “We’re incredibly proud to have our women’s team play their first league game at Anfield and for it to be a Merseyside derby against Everton makes it extra special. Our fans now have the opportunity to watch our women’s team at our spiritual home and I’m sure it will be a memorable occasion.” Vicky Jepson, Liverpool FC Women’s manager, added: “Myself, the staff and the players are all thrilled to have the opportunity to play a game at Anfield. It is always special to represent a club like Liverpool but to do so at our home stadium is a fantastic prospect. It’s a great chance for us to introduce our women’s team to a whole new group of Reds’ supporters and quite simply we can’t wait.” Liverpool have confirmed adult tickets for the game will cost £5 with up to three accompanying children able to attend the game free of charge in a bid to encourage as many people as possible to fill the 54,000-seater stadium. “Everyone at Everton is looking forward to the game at Anfield. Any Merseyside derby means so much to fans of both clubs and this will be a big occasion for the teams,” said Willie Kirk, the manager of Everton Women. “Hopefully we can build on the growing popularity of women’s football, shown by some fantastic attendances at the Etihad, Stamford Bridge and the London Stadium, and put on a show.”
