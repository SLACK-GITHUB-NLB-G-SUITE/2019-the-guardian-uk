Lawyers for a British family who made an unauthorized crossing from Canada into the United States say the family have been deported after nearly two weeks in federal custody. Bridget Cambria says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told her all seven members of the family, including an infant and toddler twins, were headed back to England. Ice declined comment Wednesday afternoon, saying it did not discuss “removal arrangements” before deportees are back in their own country. The family say they mistakenly crossed the border into Washington state while trying to avoid an animal in the road. An affidavit says family members were “treated like criminals” by their US jailers. US officials say the family crossed the border on purpose, adding that two of the family members had previously been denied entry to the US.
