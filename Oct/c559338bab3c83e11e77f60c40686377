The hottest trainer in Britain just now, Ralph Beckett, has a chance to make his mark on Champions Day at Ascot and has his fingers crossed that the excellent form of his stable near Andover can continue until the weekend. Beckett will be represented in the Fillies & Mares Stakes by Antonia De Vega, whose odds crashed from 25-1 to 10-1 as the latest entries were made on Monday for the Qipco-sponsored event. His horses have been running well in recent weeks but even so he was stunned to win four races from five runners on Newmarket’s valuable Saturday card, while his only runner at York also won a good prize that day. This Saturday’s race amounts to a significant step up in class for Antonia De Vega but Beckett knows what is required, having won the race with Simple Verse four years ago. “It was terrific,” he said of his experience at Newmarket. “The problem I had all day was that the one I fancied most was Feliciana De Vega in the last and of course you think your luck’s going to run out at any second. I certainly hope my form will carry on to the weekend. Whether it will or not is another matter … “Antonia De Vega had a small problem after an abortive trip to Ireland in the summer but I’ve been pleased with her lately and she did a nice piece in a racecourse gallop at Kempton last Friday. So we think she’s going to be ready but it’s difficult to be certain.” Beckett also expects to run the mud-loving Mitchum Swagger in the handicap at the end of the Champions Day card. “This is right up his alley,” he said. The going at Ascot is reported as heavy and the long-established flat course is waterlogged in places at Swinley Bottom. With more rain to come, it is thought likely the round-course races, including the £1m Champion Stakes, will be switched to what is normally the hurdles circuit, where the surface is drier and described as good to soft, soft in places. That would not be ideal for Beckett, given Antonia De Vega has a noted preference for very soft ground. He is also concerned that the tighter inner circuit might produce a draw bias, with those on the outside being at a disadvantage. A dozen horses are still entered for the Champion Stakes, Fox Tal having been supplemented at a cost of £75,000 on Monday. Aidan O’Brien has the top two in the betting, Magical and Japan, while there was support for the British-based Addeybb, whose preference for soft ground is well known. The only other supplementary entry was Make A Challenge, added to the Champions Sprint at a cost of £40,000. Denis Hogan’s horse was an impressive winner at The Curragh on Sunday.
