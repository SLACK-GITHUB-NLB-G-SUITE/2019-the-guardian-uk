Being a parent, and a Muslim Asian in London, I have many thoughts about the younger generation. When I think of the millennials, I think of my daughter, Coco. She is a true example of her speedy generation, living in a society that no longer considers patience as a virtue. She values self-sufficiency and independence more than the old-fashioned ideas of obedience and respect for her elders. She finds no logic in respecting someone who is arrogant and unkind, just because he or she is 20 years her senior. She thinks this is illogical and, maybe, “typically Asian”. I was brought up in a different world. Elders were obeyed without question. By the time my children became teenagers, I’d figured out that to get respect, I would have to prove to them that I know what I’m talking about. That’s why I enrolled in college. (I embarrassed my son by going to the same one as him.) Now the children are grown, they want me to respect them (which I secretly do). My millennial daughter believes in equality, and I admire that. She is truthful and assertive, and she really loves cats. The older generation has a lot to catch up on: we can do so by gaining more education, learning about technology and engaging in social media. On the other hand, young people must find time for their parents, to help bridge the gap. I read that, in 2013, China ordered children to visit their ageing parents, or face a fine or jail. It was heartbreaking that they needed to. Maybe our generations are not so different. Plato wrote, 2,300 years ago: “What’s happening to our young people? They disrespect their elders, they disobey their parents. They ignore the law. They riot in the streets, inflamed with wild notions. Their morals are decaying. What is to become of them?” And that sounds very familiar.
