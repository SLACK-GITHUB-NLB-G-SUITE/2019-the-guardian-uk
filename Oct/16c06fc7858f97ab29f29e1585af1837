I utterly disagree with TV writer Jed Mercurio, the source of the view, that real-life doctors “don’t care” about patients (Report, 17 October). The vast majority of doctors do care, very much. It is true that they are constrained by time because there are too few of them and other NHS staff. They also have to get on with the priority breakdown in the patients’ health that has presented. I do not deny that there are a few doctors who hide their light of caring under a very thick bushel. However, within the time constraint, the vast majority do listen to other issues that beset the patient and offer what advice they can, as the next patient is impatiently knocking on their clinic door. I have been working as a doctor (paediatrician) since 1966, I still do practice part-time and I reject this ridiculous generalisation.Robin DaviesTregarth, Gwynedd • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
