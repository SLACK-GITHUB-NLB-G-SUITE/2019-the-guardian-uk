Whether you’ve stayed in a beautifully situated B&B amid glorious countryside or a friendly independent hotel in a town centre on your winter breaks we want to hear about it. Tell us about your experiences; the walks that can be done from the door, the local pubs, the scenery and the accommodation’s styling, whether traditional or modern. Mention features such as woodburners, open fires, hot tubs and the food, of course – anything that would be welcome after a long day walking, shopping or sightseeing. Please include websites and prices. Only UK tips this week please, and no self-catering places. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
