Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our dishwasher has packed up after 12 years, and we’ve bought a new one for about £350. The seller wants another £50 for installation. My colleague at work says I’m mad to pay it, and that installing dishwashers and washing machines is really easy to do yourself. Is he right? (He always thinks so.) Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions tomoney@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
