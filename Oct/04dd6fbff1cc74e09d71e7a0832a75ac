Lonely Planet has named England the world’s second tourist destination in 2020. The guide book firm’s entry for England said: “Brexit uncertainties have dominated the headlines in recent years but one constant amid all the confusion has been the timeless treasures that England is famous for: the historic castles and cathedrals, the quaint villages and rolling countryside, and of course, the seaside.” It also noted that “new sections of the England Coast Path are continuing to open, making it easier for people to explore the country’s coastline”. We’d like to find out about places that are off the tourist trail. So where is your favourite undiscovered place in England? How did you come across it and what does it mean to you?
