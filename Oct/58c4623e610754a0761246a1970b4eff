Mexican club Tigres says it intends to ban a supporter for life after he appeared to grope USA international Sofia Huerta after a friendly match. Huerta posed with fans for selfies after the game between her team, Houston Dash, and Tigres Feminil on Saturday. Pictures soon appeared on social media of a man grabbing the midfielder’s chest.

We will file a lawsuit against whoever is responsible for what took place,” the club said in a statement. “Once we identify this ‘pseudo-fan,’ he will be banned for life from entering any of our facilities, and from attending any of our men’s or women’s games.” Mexico’s MedioTiempo reported on Tuesday that the man has since been identified and the lawsuit against him has been filed. The Houston Dash also condemned the incident. The club said it had “zero tolerance for what happened Saturday, and we believe that this behavior has no place in our game or in our society.” Huerta initially represented Mexico at international level but has since switched allegiance to the US. She has made seven appearances for the US but was not a member of the squad that won this year’s World Cup in France. She has also played for Adelaide United and Sydney FC in Australia’s W-League. She scored for Sydney in their victory over Perth Glory in the 2019 grand final. Huerta has yet to comment on the incident.
