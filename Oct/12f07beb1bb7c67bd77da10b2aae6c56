Everton head to Brighton after their timely win over West Ham and, Yerry Mina’s knee problem apart, are likely to keep the same side as they seek their first away win of the league season. “What we have been doing away is not good enough,” said Marco Silva, who dropped his maligned zonal-marking system in the win over the Hammers and faces a big week with a League Cup tie against his previous club, Watford, coming up on Tuesday. Brighton won this fixture 1-0 last season but will have to cope without Aaron Mooy after the midfielder was sent off in the first half of their defeat at Aston Villa. “We have to give that a 100 and whatever per cent,” said their manager, Graham Potter. “We know it is a tough game but we want to bounce back ourselves.” Mark Tallentire Saturday 3pm Venue Amex Stadium Last season Brighton 1 Everton 0 Referee Andy Madley This season G2 Y5 R0 2.5 cards/game Odds H 2-1 A 17-10 D 9-4 Subs from Button, Steele, Bong, Balogun, Richards, Murray, Jahanbakhsh, Alzate, March, Baluta, Schelotto Doubtful None Injured Bernardo (knee, Nov), Izquierdo (knee, unknown) Suspended Mooy (one match) Discipline Y11 R2 Form LDDLWL Leading scorer Maupay 3 Subs from Stekelenburg, Lössl, Sigurdsson, Delph, Schneiderlin, Kean, Calvert-Lewin, Baines, Coleman, Holgate, Tosun, Gordon Doubtful Mina (thigh) Injured Gbamin (thigh, Jan) Suspended None Discipline Y17 R2 Form WLLLLW Leading scorers Bernard, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison 2
