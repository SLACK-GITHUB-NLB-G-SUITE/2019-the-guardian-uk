The key to a good cup of tea is high-quality ingredients. For the tea itself, use leaves rather than bags, as the pieces are larger and give more flavour. While bags give the water a burst of colour and provide a quick brew, the flavour is duller. Using leaves doesn’t mean you have to use a pot: you can get great infuser baskets that allow you to make just one cup. As for the water, if you live in an area where it is hard, invest in a filter. Hard water has a higher mineral content and is the reason for the oily scum you see sometimes on the surface of tea. For black teas, the water should be boiling as it hits the leaves, so heat your crockery with a little hot water beforehand. With green teas, you want the water a little cooler – about 70C to 80C. The amount of milk you add is a personal preference, but strong black teas such as breakfast tea should be drunk with milk, as they are blended to be taken that way. Milk should be added only once the tea is ready. Sugar should be added to chai tea only, but it is important to remember that tea is about enjoyment – it is a question of what you like more than anything else.
