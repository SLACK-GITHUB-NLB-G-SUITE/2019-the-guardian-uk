It could be a bijou ski area tucked away in an obscure valley, an accidental find while heading off cross-country, or a less developed area with an old chairlift away from the main resort starting in a hamlet. We want to hear about smaller ski resorts that don’t feature much in glossy brochures. They may still join up with larger ski areas but have the feel of a small resort. Tell us about places to stay, the après scene, backcountry options and ski pass prices. Remember, Europe only this time please. Please include details of exact locations with any relevant websites and price information. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
