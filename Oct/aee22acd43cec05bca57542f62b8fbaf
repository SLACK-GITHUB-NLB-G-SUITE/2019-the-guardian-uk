The internet is down across most of Iraq on the third day of protests that were called for on social media, with a monitor saying “intentional restrictions” by major providers have caused the near-blackout. Iraqis protesting in the capital and southern cities have struggled to communicate with each other or post footage of the demonstrations since Wednesday. So far, 19 people have been reported killed, including one police officer. Restrictions were first limited to certain social media sites but were expanded later on Wednesday, leaving Iraq “largely offline”, according to the cybersecurity monitor NetBlocks. By Thursday morning, approximately three-quarters of the country including the capital, Baghdad, was disconnected after major network operators Earthlink, Asiacell and Zain “intentionally restricted” access, said NetBlocks. The north of the country, including the autonomous Kurdish region, is connected to the internet through a different system and was therefore unaffected by the blackout, according to the monitor. Authorities cut off internet access last year in response to mass protests in southern Iraq. Those outages followed a similar pattern: social media was unavailable at first before a wider internet blackout across the entire country. Iraqi authorities have not commented on the blackout.
