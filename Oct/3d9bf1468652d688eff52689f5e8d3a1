A 120-year-old lighthouse has been put on wheels and rails to move it away from the North Sea, which has been eroding the coastline of north-western Denmark. When the 23-metre (75ft) Rubjerg Knude lighthouse was first lit in 1900, it was roughly 200 metres from the coast; now it is about only six. Arne Boelt, the local mayor, said many things could go wrong when moving the defunct building, which weighs about 1,000 tons and sits on a cliff. “But it’s worth the risk ... the alternative would to dismantle the lighthouse.” The Danish environment minister, Lea Wermelin, called the lighthouse “a national treasure” in an attempt to justify the 5m kroner (£580,000) spent by the ministry to save it. Boelt and the town of Hjørring also have chipped in to foot the bill. The move is expected to last 10 hours, at a speed of eight metres per hour. The building in its original position was at risk from erosion and shifting sands. The lighthouse ceased operating in 1968, when sands eventually buried two adjacent buildings, and was briefly turned into a museum. It still attracts more than 250,000 visitors each year. The move, broadcast live on Danish news outlets, depended on the weather, which was currently fair in the region. Thirty minutes into the operation, the lighthouse had been moved 1.4 metres. In 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque Mårup church, built in a bout 1250 on a cliff, was used as one of the filming locations for the 1987 film Babette’s Feast, which became the first Danish film to win an Academy award for best foreign language film.
