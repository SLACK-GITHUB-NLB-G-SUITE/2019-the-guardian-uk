The New York Jets have released guard Kelechi Osemele a day after he had shoulder surgery without the team’s approval. Saturday’s move is the latest chapter in what has become a contentious standoff between Osemele and the team. Osemele had surgery on Friday in Boston to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. The Jets were made aware of Osemele’s plan to have surgery, but because he was not with the team and the surgery wasn’t approved, it was considered an “unexcused absence.” Sources told ESPN that the team believed Osemele could have played through the injury and had surgery at the end of the season. Osemele’s agent, Andrew Kessler, said in a statement the Jets owe the player the balance of his contract. Osemele was being fined by the Jets for refusing to practice before the surgery. The fines total $579,000 per week, the amount of each game check he was owed. His base salary for the 2019 season before the dispute was due to be $9.85m. Osmele’s representatives said they were in talks with the NFL Players’ Association about action against the Jets’ medical staff for violations of state medical board regulations. Saturday’s news comes in the midst of a miserable season for the Jets. They were on the wrong end of a lopsided defeat to the New England Patriots on Monday and are 1-5 this season.
