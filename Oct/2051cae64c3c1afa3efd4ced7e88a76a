I was living in London in 2001 and I walked into Julien Macdonald’s London fashion week show. I loved all his designs and when he showed me this dress, I thought it was the perfect thing to wear for my 21st birthday party. It’s amazing that it has become so iconic; everybody wants to wear it. I feel proud every time I see someone wearing a version of this look. When I moved to New York, I would always wear these outfits that stood out – no one was dressing that way – and now I see them everywhere. I love being a fashionista, it’s amazing to start trends and to see my picture on moodboards. Everything that Macdonald makes looks like it would be uncomfortable because it’s so intricate and crystalised, but his pieces are of such amazing quality that they are easy to wear. I love that he designs clothes that make you feel confident and beautiful. Growing up, I always had my own sense of style. I loved being unique and original and coming up with my own trends. I love the way Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham dress – they always look so chic and stylish. When I go to a party, I love to be glamorous and go all out; I like to sparkle and feel amazing. However, my everyday wear is very comfortable. I love Juicy Couture’s velour tracksuits; I probably own 100 of them in every colour. That’s my uniform when I’m chilling at home or going to the beach – anything that doesn’t involve a red carpet. I do have a signature look – I love pink and I love sparkles – but my style has changed over the years. I have been really influenced by my sister Nicky, whose style has always been the complete opposite of mine. I’ve learned to tone it down a little bit, be a little bit more understated sometimes. But it depends on the situation; I’m a chameleon. I can show up in a Chanel suit, looking like a businesswoman, but if I’m at a party or Halloween or Burning Man, then I’m going all out.
