Plans for Miami to host a La Liga game are being rekindled with the Spanish league trying again to take a regular-season game to Florida. The league says it has asked the Spanish football federation to allow Villarreal’s home game against Atlético Madrid on 6 December to be moved to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Last season the federation would not approve playing Barcelona’s game against Girona in Miami in January. Javier Tebas, the Spanish league president, said: “We hope that this time we can carry out this positive action for everyone, as other leagues like the NFL or the NBA do when they stage matches overseas.”
