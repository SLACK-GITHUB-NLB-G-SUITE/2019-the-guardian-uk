The point Selina Todd makes about the importance of creativity for working-class children (Where will the working-class playwrights come from, now the arts have been sidelined?, 1 October) resonates powerfully with me. My eventual journey, as a working-class person, to higher education, and to St Hilda’s College, Oxford, where Selina Todd is now vice-principal, was powered by my love of theatre. My comprehensive school had a narrow sense of what attainment looked like, and I left at 16 with four GCSEs. The creative opportunities I found outside of school had a profound impact on me, grew my imagination, and developed possibilities for me. My career is growing arts audiences, often from non-traditional backgrounds. This autumn, I’m working with Big Imaginations, the north of England’s children’s theatre festival. The festival will visit towns such as Dewsbury, Rochdale, St Helens, Cockermouth and Ellesmere Port, places that are characterised by low engagement with the arts, but with exactly the same nascent creativity in their children as those of wealthier towns.
