Tammy Abraham is set to receive a first competitive call-up for England when Gareth Southgate names his squad on Thursday for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria. The Chelsea striker, who has been in impressive goalscoring form for his club this season, qualifies for Nigeria through his father. He won two caps for England against Germany and Brazil in 2017 but, as they were friendlies, he retains the right to switch his international allegiance to Nigeria. That would end if he were to play any part against the Czechs in Prague next Friday or Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday week. Nigeria have attempted to persuade Abraham to transfer to them but it now appears they are resigned to him committing to England. Gernot Rohr, the manager – who has also had his eye on the Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori, another player who qualifies for Nigeria – said this week that neither were part of his current plans. “They are not interested in discussing their international options at the moment and we need to respect that,” Rohr said. “It is also significant to note that Abraham has been assured that he will be in the England squad.” Dele Alli is waiting to learn whether he will be given a recall, having struggled for form and fitness this season. The Tottenham midfielder has shaken off a hamstring injury but he has started only three games for the club and been ineffective in each of them. Southgate, who must also decide whether to select Manchester City’s Kyle Walker, having omitted him for the home ties against Bulgaria and Kosovo, will check on the fitness of Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford, who has struggled because of a groin problem. Everton’s Fabian Delph is fit and could return.
