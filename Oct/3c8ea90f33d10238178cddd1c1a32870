It is all very well claiming that because we now have over 75% of women with dependent children working, it is because of our family-friendly policies (Report, 25 October).

How hard it is to break bad habits (Report, 28 October).Christopher ClaytonChester, Cheshire • Like John Harris (Journal, 28 October), I applaud the new council-housing street in Norwich. Too bad that in three years it will leave the public sphere when its tenants assert their right to buy.Victoria PalietSouthmoor, Oxfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
