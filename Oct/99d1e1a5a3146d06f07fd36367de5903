Jennifer Aniston’s new Instagram page is “on a break” after crashing hours after the star signed up for the platform. The former Friends actor, one of social media’s most famous recluses, officially made her debut on Tuesday, causing the platform to temporarily crash as fans flocked to follow her account. In one hour, Aniston’s page had attracted more than 116,000 followers and her first post garnered hundreds of thousands of likes before crashing. Instagram users swarmed to get a glimpse of the post – a selfie featuring the main cast of Friends. Posing alongside her former co-stars, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, she wrote: “And now we’re Instagram FRIENDS too. HI INSTAGRAM.” Aniston was welcomed to the site by her friend and fellow actor Reese Witherspoon, who commented beneath the selfie: “YASSSS!!! Welcome to Insta Jen!!!” Aniston followed fellow actors including Adam Sandler and Justin Theroux, her former partner, and also commented on a picture of the cast posted by Matt LeBlanc. The 50-year-old actor was 25 when she took on the role of Rachel Green on the hit sitcom, which ran for 10 seasons and celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. This month, Aniston dismissed the possibility of a Friends movie. “Our producers wouldn’t want it, wouldn’t let us,” she said. “It would have been fun. But whatever. Maybe it’s better this way, but we’ll never know.”
