It is heartening to read that arts organisations are choosing to sever their links with fossil fuel companies following public pressure (National to cut ties with Shell as theatres bow to pressure on climate action, 5 October; RSC bows to pressure from climate crisis protest by cutting short BP sponsorship, 3 October). Of course, similar ethical choices had to be made in the past regarding financial support from tobacco companies. Thankfully that was long ago consigned to history. But was it? In fact, the London Symphony Orchestra still receives sponsorship from British American Tobacco. The LSO, like the NT and RSC, takes its work with schools and young people seriously, and it is therefore unfortunate that the orchestra retains this anachronistic relationship. Perhaps the threat of a boycott of the LSO by performers and audiences could deliver a similar positive result.Dr Dominic HorneLedbury, Herefordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
