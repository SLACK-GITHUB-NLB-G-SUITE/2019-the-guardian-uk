When Manu Tuilagi swan-dived over the line within two minutes of the end of England’s World Cup semi-final with New Zealand, their dejected opponents briefly regrouped. But the All Blacks, who had not lost in 18 consecutive World Cup matches since the 2007 quarter-finals, were unable to find a way past an imperious England side who marched into the final. Rugby fans at the Cabbage Patch pub near Twickenham roared with delight. The victory provided the news cycle with some respite from Brexit, not least for Boris Johnson, who once famously toppled a Japanese schoolchild during a game of street rugby. He congratulated the team on their “immense effort” and looked forward to the final in Yokohama next Saturday, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also applauded the team and expressed his wish that the final would see England face off against Wales, who play South Africa on Sunday. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, congratulated the team, writing: “What a game. Well done, England Rugby.” Eddie Jones’s team produced a highly impressive performance to see off favourites New Zealand 19-7 and seal a spot in the final, their first appearance since 2007, when they were defeated by South Africa, four years after winning the Webb Ellis cup. England supporters around the country and overseas posted videos of fans celebrating in pubs and rugby clubs. Clips showed fans jumping up and down with joy and singing the England rugby anthem, Swing Low Sweet Chariot.Among the famous faces enjoying the occasion was Ross Kemp, who posted a video of himself screaming: “Come on England! Yes, yes, yes. I cannot tell you what that means. It ain’t over yet, but we’re pretty close. England outstanding!” The astronaut Tim Peake said: “So proud of EnglandRugby – what an outstanding performance.”The England cricketer Stuart Broad added: “Wow! How special was that from EnglandRugby? Cancel all plans next Saturday morning – we’re watching a World Cup Final!!”
