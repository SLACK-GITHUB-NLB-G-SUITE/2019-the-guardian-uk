Jane Fonda accepted a prestigious award from Bafta Los Angeles while being led away in handcuffs after being arrested during climate emergency protests. The actor and activist was honoured with the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film at the annual Bafta Britannia ceremony. However, she could not be at the Beverly Hilton in person to accept the prize and, as is customary, sent a video message instead. Footage of Fonda being arrested in Washington DC last week was shown to the audience on big screens, with the Oscar-winning actor shouting “Bafta, thank you” as she was led away. “I’m very honoured,” she added. Folks, @Janefonda accepted the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award WHILE BEING ARRESTED. #Britannias pic.twitter.com/LDbZKTZWrs Fonda, known as much for her activism as her film career, had earlier said she was inspired to return to civil disobedience by teenage climate emergency protester Greta Thunberg. Fonda was one of 17 climate protesters arrested at the US capital on charges of unlawful demonstration by what she called “extremely nice and professional” police. She said she had moved to Washington DC so she could be more involved in the fight against climate breakdown. Fonda, who said she hoped to inspire other older activists, revealed she planned to get arrested every Friday during protests. Previous winners of the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film, which is given to “legendary individuals whose work is stamped with the indelible mark of authorship and ingenuity,” include Cate Blanchett, George Clooney and Meryl Streep.
