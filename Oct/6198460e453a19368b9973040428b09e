Blackpool beach is captured here at low tide by Guardian photographer Graeme Robertson, the setting sun casting a bewitching, painterly light across the scene. The town’s iconic seafront bisects the picture, with wheeling seabirds above, and the sun reflecting off the water below. Robertson was in town for the Conservative party conference – the last time the Lancashire seaside resort hosted one – and took a break to grab some fish and chips and watch the sun go down from the north pier. It is from there that the picture is taken.
