How do you start the day? I’ve always been an early riser so I’ll be up at 8.15am, I’ll grab a hot lemon and water and maybe a cup of tea, then I’ll get back into bed and watch Andrew Marr on TV. Home or away for breakfast? I’d rather stay home and start the day with an apple, maybe a fried egg, bacon, spring onion, tomatoes. I like my plate to look colourful. I might present my wife with breakfast on a tray – and she might reciprocate, depending on the state of our relationship on any given Sunday. Friends or family on Sunday? My work life is very social, so Sundays tend be spent with family. I’ll almost always call my dad in Australia and afternoons are often spent watching football on TV with my wife. I’m also very into flowers, so I’ll go to the florist and pick some nice ones. Are Sundays alcohol free? Not often. If I’m not drinking on Sunday – which if I’m doing theatre is my only full day off – the day can become boring so I might pour myself a glass of champagne around 12.30pm, before lunch. Why not? The perfect lunch? If we’re in, my wife will cook a roast; if we’re out we often eat Chinese. I like dim sum. Does exercise feature? It’s very difficult to coax my youngest daughter out, but I try to take her to the park to bridge the gap between about 4pm when you’ve had a few glasses of wine and you need to stop drinking, because otherwise it turns into a messy afternoon. The sound and smell of Sunday? I’m partial to a Jo Malone grapefruit candle. I’ve always loved chart music. If I hear one of my songs being played it reminds me people still love what I do and it’s given me a fantastic life. I’m eternally grateful.
