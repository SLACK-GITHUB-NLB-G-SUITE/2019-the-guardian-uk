øEvery week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My partner is obsessive about switching everything off at night, saying it’s not safe. Not just pulling the plug on the telly, but also not allowing iPad, phones, etc to charge overnight. No dishwasher either. Is she wrong? How safe is it to allow electricals to run while you’re asleep? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions tomoney@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
