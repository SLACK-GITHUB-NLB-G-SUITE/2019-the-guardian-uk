Big Imaginations, the north of England’s children’s theatre festival, is welcome to visit Dewsbury, which has apparently been identified as a place that is “characterised by low engagement with the arts” (Letters, 5 October). They will find, however, that it is far from a cultural desert. Dewsbury Arts Group has converted a former Quaker meeting house into an arts space, with a 100-seater theatre, rehearsal rooms, a massive stock of props and, of course, a bar. We have a life-drawing class that exhibits a least once a year, and a youth training scheme that presents two youth theatre showcases a year. The adult drama group presents one musical and five plays each year, which usually reach, and sometimes exceed, West End standards, and at a fraction of the price (£9 a seat). Dewsbury is easily accessible by rail from London, and even from Manchester if you can find space on a Transpennine train. Our programme is available on our website.Peter WrigleyBirstall, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
