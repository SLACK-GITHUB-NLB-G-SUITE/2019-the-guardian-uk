In response to Steve Rose (The Guide, 26 October) and Bryn Hughes (Letters, 29 October), our films are made easily available for community screenings. In response to demand to use I, Daniel Blake as a fundraiser, eOne (our distributor) made the film available for groups to hire at low cost after the initial cinema release. As a result there were over 700 community screenings around the country and it reached many viewers who would never have seen it in the cinema. We’re doing the same with Sorry We Missed You and it will be available for such screenings from 6 December.Rebecca O’BrienProducer, Sixteen Films • Samira Ahmed is right to ask for the same pay as Jeremy Vine for doing a similar 15-minute programme, but the BBC shouldn’t pay her a penny more (Report, 29 October). They should just pay Vine less.Stefan BadhamPortsmouth, Hampshire • I would like to congratulate John Gilbey on his description of Comins Coch, Ceredigion (Country diary, 28 October). His ability to paint beautiful pictures with words left me speechless. Margaret TaylorClare, Suffolk • I chuckled my way through Jean Hannah Edelstein’s piece on Kylie Jenner’s application to trademark the phrase “rise and shine”. (Journal, 28 October). There might be copyright issues, since it originates in the book of Isaiah 60:1: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come…” (King James Version).Rebecca ElderJerusalem, Israel • My tutor once opined that philosophers were people walking across a muddy field, not to get to the other side but to obliterate the footprints of those who went before (Letters, 29 October).Brian SimpsonLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
