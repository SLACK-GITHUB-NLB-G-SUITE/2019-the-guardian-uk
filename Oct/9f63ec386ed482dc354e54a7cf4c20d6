Joey Barton, manager of Fleetwood Town, will stand trial after pleading not guilty to a charge of assaulting Daniel Stendel, his Barnsley counterpart, when the teams met in League One last season. Barton, 37, is alleged to have pushed Stendel from behind, leaving the German needing emergency dental treatment after banging his face on the metal framework of the tunnel at Oakwell. Barnsley made formal complaints to the English Football League and the Football Association after the incident, which came directly after a 4-2 win for Barnsley on 13 April. Stendel left the club earlier this week after a run of disappointing results. Barton appeared at Barnsley magistratesâ€™ court and denied a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was given unconditional bail and will appear at Sheffield crown court next month for a hearing to prepare for a trial.
