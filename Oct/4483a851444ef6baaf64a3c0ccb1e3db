Zoë Kravitz has landed the role of Catwoman in The Batman, a new take on the dark DC superhero. The Big Little Lies star will play Selina Kyle and her alter ego alongside Robert Pattinson, who will take on the lead role. The film comes from Matt Reeves, whose credits include Cloverfield and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The 30-year-old daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet reportedly went through a rigorous testing process that saw her compete alongside Ana de Armas, Ella Balinska and Eiza González. After Kravitz tested last week with Pattinson, she secured the part. The Batman is being billed as a more grounded take on the character. “It’s very much a point of view-driven, noir Batman tale,” Reeves said to the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. “It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional. It’s more Batman in his detective mode than we’ve seen in the films. The comics have a history of that. He’s supposed to be the world’s greatest detective, and that’s not necessarily been a part of what the movies have been.” The cast is also set to include Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon while Jonah Hill is also in talks for an unspecified villain role. Kravitz’s credits include the Divergent series and Mad Max: Fury Road. She will next be seen in Hulu’s reimagined take on High Fidelity. Sources suggest The Batman will begin production late this year or early 2020 with a summer 2021 release date confirmed. The casting news follows the record-breaking box office success of Joker, which has made $548m worldwide since its 4 October release.
