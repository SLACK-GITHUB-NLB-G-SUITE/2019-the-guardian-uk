Unlike Harold and Antonia (Letters, 23 October), my wife and I have yet to visit James Joyce’s grave in Zurich, but we did manage to find the grave of his daughter, Lucia, in Kingsthorpe cemetery in Northampton last week. If Dublin councillors are looking to stimulate a bit of tourist trade, a better option might be repatriating the remains of the Dubliner Violet Gibson, whose grave is also in Kingsthorpe. Violet is renowned for attempting to assassinate Mussolini, but ending up only hitting his nose. I think there may be a Brexit analogy there.Rob WoodNottingham • Deborah Orr (Obituary, 22 October) has been an inspiration to me in showing how a writer can be strident in one’s convictions, yet express themselves in an even-handed way. A sad loss for us all.Jon CorfieldBirmingham • Having just read Suzanne Moore’s wonderful tribute to Deborah Orr (Journal, 23 October), all I can say is that we all can only dream of having such a brilliant friend.Terry Weldon Basildon, Essex • “Clitheroe ... a short train ride from Manchester” (Report, 24 October): the train takes 1 hour 20 minutes, runs every 30 minutes and likely as not is formed of two carriages. For comparison the fast train from Preston to London takes 2 hours 11 minutes.Tony HirstDarwen, Lancashire • Re English mistakes (Letters, 24 October), my favourite comes from a pub in Derbyshire, whose children’s menu advertised “turkey-shaped dinosaur pieces”. Must have had those in the freezer a long time.Bill SharrodShrewsbury, Shropshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
