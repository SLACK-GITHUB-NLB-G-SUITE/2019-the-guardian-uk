A six-year-old boy who sustained severe injuries after allegedly being thrown from a viewing platform at Tate Modern in London has been moved out of intensive care. The boy, a French national who cannot be named, was visiting London with his family and fell 30 metres from the art gallery’s 10th floor on to a fifth-floor roof in August. He has now been transferred to a rehabilitation centre and faces a lengthy recovery period. In a post on a GoFundMe page that has raised more than £124,000 for the boy’s medical care, his parents said he was still unable to speak but he was making progress and looked like “a little knight” because of splints keeping his healing bones in place. “He still has some metal in his body but instead of plasters he has got a full armour of splints: legs, feet, hands, arms, neck and torso,” they said. “It is impressive – he looks like a little knight, and we can take these splints off sometimes. “He also makes some little progress – he moves his right hand more and more and arm on command (he catches us most of the time when we are nearby!) even if he feels sometimes a little bit sad when he doesn’t manage to do what he tries. “We really hope he will speak and eat again as soon as possible, but we know that it can take months.” They added: “Thank you so much all of you again to help us in our fight. Our little boy doesn’t give up, and we neither!” Jonty Bravery, 18, from west London, is accused of attempted murder over the incident and is due to appear in court for a plea hearing next month.
