Alec Baldwin’s Trump returns, holding court at a surprise rally in New Mexico (“my favorite Mexico”), railing against Democrats and denying any “quid bro code” with Ukraine. The president brings on a conga line of deranged sycophants, including a couple of conspiracy nuts, mealy-mouthed Lindsey Graham, a recently freed fighter who thanks Trump for “bringing jobs back … to Isis” and a robotic Mark Zuckerberg, fresh off “getting his ass completely owned by AOC”. Eventually, Trump is joined by a wandering Bill Clinton (former cast member and current announcer Daryl Hammond), who wishes him good luck on his forthcoming impeachment, and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Fred Armisen), who offers to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, or, better yet, “just make him disappear”. It’s another rushed, messy cold open with little in the way of cleverness, commentary or laughs. Chance the Rapper returns, as both host and musical guest. Recalling his previous appearance, in which he donated a million to Chicago public schools, he gives a shout out to the city’s teachers, currently on strike. Joined by Kyle Mooney, he performs a song in honor of “the Second City”, extolling the virtues of all things second best – Pepsi, Burger King fries, Sega Genesis, Scottie Pippen. He ends with a shout out to his wife and newborn daughter, wrapping up a clever and heartfelt, if not particularly funny, musical monologue. Some special guests at the Trump rally ‼️ pic.twitter.com/HvgumqdEXO The League of Legends World Championship is covered by Lazlo Holmes, a basketball reporter who finds himself very confused by his new e-sports beat. As Holmes, Chance is noticeably stilted and awkward, tripping over his lines. This does not bode well. He acquits himself better in First Impressions Court, playing a Chicago judge who declares the defendants – including a smooth-talking hustler, a nerdy white ventriloquist, a male exotic dancer and a hunky gigolo (surprise guest Jason Momoa) – guilty on sight. Momoa wins the audience over by taking off his shirt, showing off his pierced nipples. A commercial for Tasty Toaster Tarts sees a group of happy-go-lucky teens freak-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that their host, Jason, has murdered his parents and stashed their bodies in the refrigerator. Perfectly succinct and surprisingly unnerving, this pre-filmed sketch is the night’s high point. In Spooky Song, a canoodling couple happen upon a group of graveyard ghosts, who regale them with sing-song stories of their earthly demises – all save one spirit, who really doesn’t want to talk about how he died. Eventually, he admits to a fetish for sitting on high voltage charges, which led him to stick a metal pole up his butt and wait for lightning to strike. He sums up the result in enjoyably gruesome fashion, singing, “And my ass burnt off and my thing caught on fire and my face caught on fire and I went in my pants – Happy Halloween!” A clever self-introduction and cute animated short featuring Chance’s young daughter leads into his first musical performance, It’s Possible. Weekend Update kicks off on another bad week for the president. Colin Jost covers Trump’s foreboding tweets from earlier in the day, including an unexplained ellipsis (with four dots instead of three) and the announcement that “Something very big has just happened”. This unnerves Jost, since, coming from Trump, that something “could mean we just invaded Mexico … or the McRib is back.” Che lays into Rudy Giuliani butt-dialing a reporter while talking about the Ukraine investigation: “Somehow, Giuliani went from the Mayor of 9/11 to the 9/11 of mayors.” The segment’s sole guests are Eric and Donald Trump Jr (Alex Moffatt and Mikey Day), who accuse Joe Biden’s son Hunter of profiting from nepotism (or as Eric calls it, “nipple teasing”) while showing zero self-awareness about their own unearned status and wealth. The portrayal continues to grate, not only because it’s intentionally muggy. It also gives short shrift to how Donald Jr continually proves himself the dopier of the two in real life. Oh, he's 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺 guilty. #ChanceOnSNL pic.twitter.com/BAblTN7kJn Next, Chance and Cecily Strong play singles who meet cute at a restaurant and literally sweep each other off their feet, floating through the air and crashing into everything in sight. Strong excels at the awkward physical comedy but the sketch is completely thrown by the wonky wire effects. The whole thing is a disaster, but not necessarily an unwelcome one, as its chaos proves mesmerizing. Space Mistakes is “another film about the dangers of space” which “asks the question: what if you messed up at work … but your work was in space”. Even though it’s one-note and drags on far too long, it’s a solid parody of the current glut of big budget space dramas, the accuracy put in sharp relief during the following break, which included an ad for Apple’s upcoming web series For All Mankind. Momoa and his pierced nipples make a brief return, introducing Chance for the second musical spot of the night. Joined by Megan Thee Stallion, he performs Handsome. The closing sketch is a silly and grating bit involving an Earth, Wind and Fire dance troupe and their werewolf choreographer. It aims for random weirdness but falls completely flat. Chance sends things off with by randomly praising Jesus Christ – trying to one-up Kanye perhaps? – thereby ending an awkward episode on an awkward note. As a comedic actor, the Rapper is not without some chops. But he’s simply not well-suited to live comedy. That didn’t stop SNL from having him back, so it’s unlikely it’ll keep him from hosting again in the future.
