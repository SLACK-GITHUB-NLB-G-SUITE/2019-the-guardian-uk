This November, Olivia Colman will embody one of the defining British women of the 20th century in a role that explores the power dynamics of gender: singing the immortal words of Beth Gibbons on a cover of Portishead’s 1995 single Glory Box. In addition to her starring role as the Queen in Netflix drama The Crown, Colman will make her recording debut on Got It Covered, a charity compilation to benefit BBC Children in Need in which a group of stars cover songs that are significant to them. Helena Bonham-Carter – who will play the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming series of the Crown – will cover Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now, and Colman’s former Broadchurch co-star David Tennant will take on the Proclaimers’ Sunshine on Leith. The album was recorded at Abbey Road studios. It also features Doctor Who’s Jodie Whittaker covering Yellow by Coldplay, Jim Broadbent singing Rogers and Hart’s Blue Moon and Suranne Jones taking on Clean Bandit’s Symphony. Himesh Patel, star of Danny Boyle’s recent Beatles-themed film Yesterday, will sing All These Things That I’ve Done by the Killers. The album will be released on 1 November, with at least £1.50 from every sale benefitting the charity. A documentary about the making of the compilation will be shown on BBC One prior to the annual Children in Need broadcast on 16 November. This year’s appeal will mark the organisation’s 39th anniversary.
