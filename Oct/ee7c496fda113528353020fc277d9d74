Morrissey has performed in Los Angeles wearing a vest with the slogan “Fuck the Guardian”. The former Smiths frontman wore the top during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl on Saturday, weeks after he described this newspaper as “the voice of all that is wrong and sad about modern Britain”. The 60-year-old singer, who has repeatedly expressed support for the far-right party For Britain, has increasingly been lashing out at the Guardian in recent months. Writing on his personal website in May, Morrissey claimed he was the victim of an “inexhaustible hate campaign” by the Guardian, imploring his supporters: “Please do not buy this wretched hate-paper, whose every 2019 utterance echoes the late Mary Whitehouse.” During a May performance on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Morrissey decided to wear a For Britain badge. In June, he reaffirmed his support for the party in an interview with his nephew, published again on his own website. Earlier this month he ejected an anti-far-right protester from his concert in Portland. The protester had been carrying two posters, one which depicted the logo of For Britain struck through by a red line, while the other read: “Bigmouth indeed.” Writing in the Guardian in July, comedian and former Morrissey fan Stewart Lee said he found the best way to deal with the singer was to simply stop listening to him. “Suddenly, I just didn’t want Morrissey in my home any more. And I couldn’t imagine any circumstances under which I would ever listen to him again,” he wrote. The same month, Billy Bragg condemned Morrissey for sharing a video from a YouTube channel that argued that the British establishment was using Stormzy to promote multiculturalism at the expense of white culture.
