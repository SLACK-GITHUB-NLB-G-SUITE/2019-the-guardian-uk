A few years ago, I met a lovely lady who had just separated from her partner and had two young children. She has since divorced and we have bought a house together. Mostly, everything is great. However, her mother, who lives on the other side of the world, visits the UK two or three times a year – and stays with us for two or three months each time. I cannot keep living with her. She drives me insane! She doesn’t respect the rules of the house and she is always there. I have explained my issues to my girlfriend, but to no avail. I don’t want to lose her, but I am running out of patience. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
