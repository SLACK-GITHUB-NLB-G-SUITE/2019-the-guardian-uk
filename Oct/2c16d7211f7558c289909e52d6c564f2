José Mourinho turned down an approach from Lyon because “he has already chosen another club”, according to the French team’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas. Aulas is trying to recruit a successor to Sylvinho, who was sacked on Monday after only 11 matches in charge, and the 70-year-old said he had discussed the job with Mourinho. “We had some fairly flattering exchanges over SMS,” Aulas was quoted by Get French Football News. “It was nice for everyone. He did not accept our proposal to meet because he has already chosen another club.” Mourinho has been out of management since his dismissal by Manchester United last December. He has said: “I have to be patient and wait for the right opportunity and the right opportunity is one that is at the same size and the same level that I am as a manager.” Aulas described Rémi Garde, a former Lyon player who had a successful spell as manager before an ill-fated move to Aston Villa, as “a possible route”.
