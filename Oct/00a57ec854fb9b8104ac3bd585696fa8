Reading your article (Death? Why our brains tell us it only happens to other people, 19 October) and the letter from Chris Seidal (22 October) regarding entering the “obituary belt”, I find it strangely comforting in my increasingly crowded social, funereal calendar to view myself as in the rectum of life, waiting to be ejected into the great lavatory pan of eternity. We all have our ways of becoming comfortable with our own mortality, and the enteric analogy mirrors our transit through the vale of tears. The egg sandwiches also help.David MakinDobcross, Greater Manchester • The letters about death reminded me of a letter Billy Graham received from a man who said: “I could stand living with my wife in heaven for 100,000 years or so, but can’t face living with her for eternity.” Can’t remember what advice Billy gave.John Richards Oxford • Your editorial (22 October) ponders the return of James Joyce’s ashes to Dublin, the city of his birth.
