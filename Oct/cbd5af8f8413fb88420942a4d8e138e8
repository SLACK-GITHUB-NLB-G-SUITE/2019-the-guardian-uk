The afternoon sun casts long and elegant shadows in a clearing at Westonbirt arboretum, Gloucestershire, captured by the Guardian photographer Felix Clay, who died in May 2019 after a long illness. Clay positioned the tree in the centre of his image, drawing the eye in. At first glance, the photograph appears to be a landscape, but look more closely and you can see a lone figure next to the tree. The image was taken in early November, but it looks as though it is much earlier in the year, as the branches are still in leaf, probably thanks to the heatwave that swept Britain that summer.
