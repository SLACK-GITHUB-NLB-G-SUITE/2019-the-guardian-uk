Temple AdventurePrice £1,795, templecycles.comFrame Reynolds steelBrakes discGears Shimano 105Wheels Hunt At its most basic, a bicycle is little more than a pedal-driven contraption to take you from A to B, with less effort than walking. But add some soul, imagination and design into the equation and you have a magical machine with the ability to transcend the everyday. Therefore, when you buy a new bike, be sure to spend time and care savouring what could be the start of a beautiful new relationship. Over at Temple Cycles, that decision starts with a cup of tea. The independent brand that started out in the west country now has a shop and factory in Bristol and a new branch in London. Anyone who pops in for a chat and a test ride will find a warm welcome. All their bikes are made using Reynolds steel and are built in the UK. Steel frames are strong, long-lasting and lightweight. These are bikes your hipster grandchildren will be digging out of your shed in 50 years’ time. One of Temple’s latest models is the Adventure. Fitted with Hunt wheels, disc brakes and Shimano’s ever-reliable 105 groupset, it’s the ultimate go-anywhere bike ready to traverse rough terrain, keep pace on tarmac or tour through hills – and be your action buddy. Light, strong and very safe, HEXR is the world’s first custom-made cycle helmet. HEXR bike helmet, £349, hexr.com Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166
