Bulgaria’s ministry of interior has confirmed the death of a British national in Sofia before England’s Euro 2020 qualifier. A spokeswoman said: “A 32-year-old man has sadly died. Police are working to clarify all the circumstances in this incident.” A cause of death has yet to be identified. Local police released a statement saying that the man had been discovered in a “helpless” condition in the city centre but reports that he may have taken drugs have not been confirmed. A police statement said that the man died as he was being transported to a police station from the hospital. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would not comment on the circumstances of the death but confirmed that they were supporting the man’s family. “Our staff are in contact with the UK and Bulgarian authorities,” a spokesperson said. The incident comes after an England fan was taken to hospital in the early hours of Monday with a broken arm after reportedly clashing with a group of Bulgarians. Around 3,400 England fans are believed to be in Sofia for Monday’s match, with Gareth Southgate’s side due to kick off at 9.45pm local time. Fourteen England fans were arrested in Prague on Friday before the Euro 2020 qualifier against the Czech Republic after they started throwing bottles towards armed police in riot gear.
