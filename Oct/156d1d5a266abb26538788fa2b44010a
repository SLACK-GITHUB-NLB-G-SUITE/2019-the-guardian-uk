Reading have appointed their sporting director Mark Bowen as head coach on a contract until the end of the season. The 55-year-old joined Reading as a technical director in March before assuming greater responsibility in the summer. It will be Bowen’s first permanent management post after caretaker spells and a lengthy career as an assistant manager, predominantly to Mark Hughes, most recently at Southampton last year. “Mark has two decades of coaching background on his CV, has tasted promotion to the Premier League and spent most of his coaching career in top-flight football,” said Reading’s chief executive, Nigel Howe. “He came in at a critical period last season to help us retain our Championship status and had an immediate impact. He knows this club and the owner and the board believe he is very capable of getting the very best out of a talented group of first team players and achieving the results we all want.” Bowen, who also worked alongside Hughes at Fulham, Queens Park Rangers and Stoke City, replaces the Portuguese José Gomes, who was sacked last week. Reading view Bowen, who is expected to name Eddie Niedzwiecki as his assistant, as a safe pair of hands. His first game will be at home to Preston North End on Saturday. Reading, who finished 20th last season, are 22nd in the Championship after winning two of their opening 11 matches. Reading’s Championship rivals Millwall have had an approach accepted for the Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth, who has also held talks over the vacant Sunderland post. The League Two side Leyton Orient are set to appoint the Bournemouth loans manager Carl Fletcher as their head coach. Ross Embleton, who took interim charge following the death of Justin Edinburgh in June, is expected to stay on as the former midfielder’s assistant. Fletcher, who has also worked with the Under-18s and Under-23s at Bournemouth, previously managed Plymouth Argyle but was sacked in January 2013.
