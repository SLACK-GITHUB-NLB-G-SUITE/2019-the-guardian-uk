Ben Youngs has called on England to fly out of the blocks against Australia on Saturday after pinpointing a slow start as the reason they lost their last World Cup quarter-final eight years ago. Youngs is one of only two members of the England XV to start a World Cup knockout match, having been part of the side who lost to France eight years ago along with Manu Tuilagi. That day France led by 16 points after 31 minutes and England were unable to recover. Under Eddie Jones, England have developed a habit of scoring early tries – in their last 19 matches they have scored one inside 10 minutes on 12 occasions – but it was also a sluggish start that proved their undoing in the 2015 defeat by Australia that eliminated them from their own World Cup. The Wallabies led 17-3 at half-time and England could not claw back the deficit. As a result, Youngs urged England to begin on the front foot on Saturday, revealing that Jones and the captain, Owen Farrell, had hammered home the message during their final training session on Friday. “My experience [of 2011] is just about making sure the intensity of the game doesn’t shock you in the beginning,” said Youngs. “France raced that day into a lead and we couldn’t pull ourselves back. So it comes down to making sure we come out of the blocks, bring that intensity from the start and I’m sure they will be saying the same thing so I imagine the first 20 minutes will be pretty full-on. We need to make sure we get the start we want. “We just spoke about how good our prep has been, and making sure we go out there and take the game to them, get ourselves on the front foot and come out with an intensity that marries up with our preparation so that’s been the message and it certainly feels like we’ve built towards the game.” Youngs and Tuilagi are two of four players – Dan Cole and Courtney Lawes are the others – who are taking part in their third World Cup campaigns for England, having reached the last eight in 2011 and gone out in the pool stages four years later. Youngs admitted that neither of those campaigns were acceptable but believes England are in a far better place as they seek a first World Cup semi-final since 2007. Warming to the theme after Jones urged England to channel the ‘samurai spirit’ in Saturday’s do-or-die clash, Youngs added: “You aren’t going to go out there and accept things not going your way. You are going to fight right until the end. We have some boys in this team who don’t know when they are beaten and I’m sure, it goes without saying for any team participating this weekend, that they will fight until the very end. Back home the expectation is the same as always – to win and put it all out on the pitch. This will be no different. It’s no different to any time we step on to the pitch as an England player – we go out there to win and to perform and put it all out there. • Fixtures, tables and results • Top try and points scorers • Stadium guide • Referee guide • Our latest minute-by-minute live reports • Sign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter Team guidesPool A: Ireland, Japan, Russia, Samoa, ScotlandPool B: Canada, Italy, Namibia, New Zealand, South AfricaPool C: Argentina, England, France, Tonga, USAPool D: Australia, Fiji, Georgia, Uruguay, Wales “We clearly weren’t good enough in 2011 or 2015. But certainly in 2019, I feel we are more capable, I feel like the squad is more capable of achieving something. So from that point of view, as I said before, we’ve just got to make sure when we take the field, we relax, we have clear thinking, and we go out there and put our best put forward.”
