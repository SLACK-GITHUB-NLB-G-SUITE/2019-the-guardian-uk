Two men have been arrested over alleged racist abuse of players at a football match between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town on Saturday. The FA Cup qualifier was abandoned following the incident, which prompted players from both sides to walk off in the 64th minute. The Haringey manager, Tom Loizou, alleged that his defender Coby Rowe was subjected to the abuse and his goalkeeper, Douglas Pajetat, was also said to have been spat at and had missiles thrown at him. Players from both teams in the match at Coles Park were led off by their managers and took the decision not to finish the match, shortly after Yeovil had gained a 1-0 lead. Two men, aged 23 and 26, were arrested in Chard and Yeovil on suspicion of racially aggravated common assault. Both were in custody at a Somerset police station. Metropolitan police officers are leading the investigation with the help of Avon and Somerset police. The Football Association has launched an investigation and both Haringey and Yeovil have said they will cooperate with the authorities. Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 . The FA said it was deeply concerned about the allegation and was looking into the incident “as a matter of urgency”. It is thought that the incident was the first time a match at such a senior level has been abandoned because of alleged racism. The alleged incident occurred just five days after England’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria was halted twice as fans were warned about racist behaviour.
