Two green parties appear to have made significant gains in Swiss parliamentary elections while a rightwing populist party remains the country’s strongest. Projections for SRF public television several hours after polls closed on Sunday tallied with pre-election expectations of a repeat of boosts for green parties in neighbouring Germany and Austria in recent European and national elections. The Green party was projected to win 12.7% of the vote, up from 7.1% four years ago, and the Green Liberals were on track for 7.6%, up from 4.6%. Support for the Swiss People’s party was projected at 26.3%, down from its peak of 29.4% in an election four years ago that coincided with the peak of an influx of migrants to Europe. There are three other parties in the government: the centre-left Social Democrats, who were projected to win 16.5%; the pro-business Liberals, expected to get 15.2%; and the Christian Democrats, heading for 12%. It is unclear whether the results will prompt any changes in the government’s composition. The legislature elects the seven members of the Federal Council, which makes decisions by consensus. The country’s presidency rotates between its members on an annual basis, and voters directly have a say on policy issues in referendums several times a year. The People’s party, the Social Democrats and Liberals each have two seats on the Federal Council at present, and the Christian Democrats have one.
