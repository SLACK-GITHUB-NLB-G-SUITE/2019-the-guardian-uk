A lawyer for R Kelly is calling for his release from prison on health grounds. Steve Greenberg says the R&B star, currently in jail awaiting trial, is suffering from anxiety, an untreated hernia and numbness in one of his hands. In a New York court filing, Greenberg argues Kelly “is not presently receiving adequate medical care”. He also complains of other restrictions faced by Kelly: “His visits are severely restricted; presently, he is only allowed one unrelated person to visit. In other words, although he lives and has lived with two lady friends, only one of them is allowed to be on his visiting list, and after 90 days he is required to switch. No other friends or professional colleagues are allowed to visit. That is not right.” A hearing regarding the status of Kelly’s case has been set for 2 October. Kelly was arrested in July on two sets of sex-related charges, including coercion, physical abuse and sex with underage girls. In February, he had been arrested on 10 counts of sexual abuse, pleaded not guilty and was released on bail; he was charged with 11 further counts in May. After the fresh charges in July, bail was refused, and a trial date has been set for April 2020. The singer, once one of the most successful R&B artists in the US, has always maintained his innocence. He has faced allegations of sexual abuse, often with girls below the age of consent, for decades, but has only once been brought to trial. In 2008, he was acquitted of producing child pornography after allegedly being filmed having sex with an underage girl.
