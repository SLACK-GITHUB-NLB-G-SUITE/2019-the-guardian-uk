Q Shortly before my ex-wife and I separated, we bought a house together. We are now divorced and both have new partners. I am still named on the mortgage and until recently was a joint tenant on the property with my now ex-wife. I have just signed the paperwork to sever the joint tenancy and will become tenants in common. I also have no beneficial interest in the property since the date of our separation. My ex-wife is legally bound by court order to use all endeavours to release me from the mortgage on the property by May 2020. As I would like to buy a house with my new partner which will be in my name only initially, am I liable for the higher rate of stamp duty under current legislation?DW A It all depends. Since 22 November 2017, if you have a major interest in a property which is no longer your main residence but is still the main residence of your ex-spouse or ex-civil partner and your major interest is the subject of a “relevant” court order, your ex-property is ignored when assessing which rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) you have to pay when buying another property. A “relevant” court order is one under the pieces of legislation detailed in the divorce and civil partnership dissolution section of the government’s Stamp Duty Land Tax Manual. So if you’ve got the right sort of court order, you won’t have to pay the higher rate of SDLT on the property you plan to buy with your new partner. But if your court order wasn’t issued under any of the relevant pieces of legislation you will have to pay the higher rate. Prior to 22 November 2017, whatever kind of court order you had, having an interest in a former home would also have meant paying the higher rate of SDLT on the purchase of a second property.
