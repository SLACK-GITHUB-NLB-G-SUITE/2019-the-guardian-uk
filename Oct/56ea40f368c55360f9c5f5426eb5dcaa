I have had ongoing issues with Green Star Energy. When my bank detected fraudulent activity on my account, Green Star was one of the payees. My compromised bank account was refunded and closed, and my credit file updated. Green Star confirmed that a fraudulent email address had been used to set up an account in my name and promised to investigate, but in the year since then I have heard nothing except for letters threatening to send debt collectors. I am 24 and have always lived with my parents who have been with Scottish Gas for 10 years. Green Star has, on numerous occasions, told me it can’t give me any information about the account as I can’t confirm the email address – which it has already told me is fraudulent. I am deeply upset about this as I’m scared my credit score will be affected. The debt collectors’ letters keep coming and I keep trying to get in contact with the company but it is unwilling to help me.RM, Glasgow “Take control of your energy” is Green Star’s slogan, but it is dispiritingly unrepentant about its refusal to let you do so. It tells me that when it opened the account in your name it was acting in good faith on information provided by a third-party broker. It fails to explain why its good faith did not extend to the information you provided showing that you were not a willing customer. After ignoring your pleas for over a year it has finally acted on a prompt from the Observer and, without a breath of apology, agreed to close the account in your name and call off the hounds.
