Thank you for challenging the myth that privately purchased hearing aids are inherently better than those provided by the NHS (Hearing aids: is going private better than the NHS?, Money, 12 October). It would be as valuable a service to alert readers who had given up going to the theatre that many theatres benefit from captioned performances, so that everything on stage is made clear to everyone through subtitles around the stage. I’m constantly surprised that the work of Stagetext in delivering this isn’t better known. Along with developments like the National Theatre’s smart caption glasses, captioning really does free up people to hear again, whatever aids they may or may not use.Richard LeeLeigh-on-Sea, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
