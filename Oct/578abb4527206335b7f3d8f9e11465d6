Garry O’ConnorW&N, £20, pp368 Sir Ian McKellen got cold feet about writing his memoirs, in the end returning a substantial advance to his publisher. In its stead his old friend Garry O’Connor has produced a fascinating account of the actor’s life and career – his passions, his craft, his gay rights activism, not to mention his generosity (“Gandalf pays”’ is his habitual cry at the end of a meal). The occasional questionable value judgment on his work aside, this is surely the definitive McKellen biography. Neil HegartyHead of Zeus, £7.99, pp320 With his second novel (following the excellent Inch Levels) the Irish author Neil Hegarty proves again that he is one to watch. After an atmospheric prologue dealing with the making of a Victorian painting, The Jewel, the narrative moves to the present day where we are given detailed perspectives on the curation, theft and recovery of the picture. Hegarty writes with sharp intelligence, which coupled with his strong storytelling and well-defined characters, results in a gripping plot that also offers an affecting insight into how artifice permeates our lives. Anna FreemanW&N, £8.99, pp368 The quote on the dustjacket (“It’s Peaky Blinders with a feminist twist!”) sells Anna Freeman’s intelligent and stylish novel short. Like Dominick Donald’s Breathe, it’s a crime story set in the great smog of London in 1952, but while Donald used the fog as a metaphor for the crimes of John Christie, Freeman focuses on a gang of female thieves, led by Florrie, who is beginning to have doubts about her purpose and vocation. The author has an ear for snappy argot, whether it’s a sharp one-liner or slangy insult, making for a promising debut. • To order Ian McKellen: The Biography or Five Days of Fog go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
