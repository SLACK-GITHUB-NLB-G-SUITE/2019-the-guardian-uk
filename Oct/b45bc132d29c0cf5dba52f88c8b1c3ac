Attorneys for victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history said on Thursday they have reached a settlement to resolve lawsuits that is expected to pay between $735m and $800m. A statement from Las Vegas law firm Eglet Adams said the amount of the settlement with MGM Resorts International would depend on the number of plaintiffs who choose to take part. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against the owner of the resort where a gunman opened fire into an outdoor concert on 1 October 2017. The company also owns the venue where 58 people died and hundreds were injured. The law firm said an independent party would be appointed by a court to evaluate claims and dole out money from the settlement fund. MGM officials did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
