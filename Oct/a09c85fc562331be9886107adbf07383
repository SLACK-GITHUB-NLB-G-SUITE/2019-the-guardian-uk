1) It’s the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals this weekend, and there have been some mighty last-eight clashes down the years. The 2015 match between Scotland and Australia will always be remembered for the controversial penalty that broke Scottish hearts at the death. But the Wallabies’ 35-34 win had everything, including interceptions, a rain storm and eight tries. France’s shock win over the All Blacks in 2007 was pretty special too. That win for Les Bleus in front of their home fans comes in at No 7 in this list of most memorable World Cup moments, also starring David Campese, Jonah Lomu and Nelson Mandela. Meanwhile … who could forget Jason Robinson’s electrifying run and pass to set up Will Greenwood’s try in England’s 2003 quarter-final win over Wales? That same tournament also provided one of the greatest passes the game has ever seen, from Carlos Spencer to send Joe Rococoko over to score for the All Blacks in their last-eight win against South Africa. 2) Typhoon Hagibis may have eased in time for Japan’s breathtaking win over Scotland, but the cancellation of Italy’s match against the All Blacks denied Sergio Parisse his World Cup swansong at the age of 36. No matter, let’s remember the power, the pace and the personality.

Liverpool fans might prefer this compilation of their 10 best Premier League goals at Old Trafford. Danny Murphy features twice! Here Michael Owen and Paul Ince discuss one of football’s great rivalries. 4) What do you do when your teammate makes an interception, spins away from a tackle and bolts 70 yards in the wrong direction towards his own end zone? Drag him down and put the remarkable footage on Twitter of course. Spots center not top 10 and Top 10???? I saved the game with the tackle, teammate ran the opposite way off the interception🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️😂😂@BleacherReport @SportsCenter @houseofhighligh @overtime @ScottVanPeezy @RandyMoss pic.twitter.com/DjSSFy2hTf 5) If you thought that was strange, check out the dexterity shown by this cartwheeling high school footballer. Simone Biles eat your heart out. And is this the most disrespectful thing you’ve seen on a football field? 6) Eliud Kipchoge broke the two-hour barrier for the marathon on Saturday, and afterwards said ‘anything is possible’. A day later rigid Brigid Kosgei took 81 seconds off Paula Radcliffe’s world marathon record. Here’s Kipchoge crushing the men’s world record in Berlin last year. And watch some mere mortals trying to keep up with his record pace on a running machine, with disastrous consequences. 7) Let’s hear it for the world conker championships … School of hard knocks: the World Conker Championships pic.twitter.com/DgViaqh4VH 1) Henry Olonga belts out This Is ‘The Moment’ on The Voice (Australia edition). 2) All 38 goals of Hugo Sánchez’s goals for Real Madrid in the 1989-90 La Liga season were scored with just one touch. 3) With Bathurst approaching, here’s a great insight into the preparation of the big three marques in the lead up to the 1970 race. 4) Free-kick routine? Pah! There’s only one way to score a free-kick. 5) Hornussen – the sport of, um, Swiss farmers. Spotters’ badges: whobroughtoranges, GrahamClayton, Xanthe95 Do subscribe, if you fancy.
