Frankie Dettori is “absolutely buzzing” following the surprise announcement that Enable is to race on next year at the age of six, a reaction that will be widely shared among racing fans. The veteran mare, whose winning run came to an end in Paris last week, had already been ruled out of Champions Day this weekend and followers of the sport had begun to reconcile themselves to the likelihood she had run her last race and would now be packed off to her owner’s stud in Newmarket. Instead she will be kept in training with John Gosden. “Enable has come out of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in good form and will not race again this year,” said the owner’s racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe. “Her programme will be determined entirely on her wellbeing, so no racing plans will be announced at this stage. The Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe remains an important target.” Rain-softened ground robbed Enable of the chance to win a third consecutive Arc, as she was overhauled by the stout stayer Waldgeist in the closing stages. But she may yet become the first horse to win Europe’s most prestigious Flat race for a third time and bookmakers installed her as the 7-1 favourite for next year’s contest, when the Arc will be 100-years-old. Ascot’s King George at the end of July will also be a key target. Enable shares with Dahlia and Swain the distinction of being the only horses to have won that race twice and she could be the first to make it three. A seemingly emotional Dettori was reported as saying: “She is the world’s favourite horse. To have one more year with my special girl is amazing. I can’t wait to sit back on her again on the racetrack next year. I’m absolutely buzzing about this. “To me she has been the horse of a lifetime and to have one more year is wonderful. If we can get her to the Arc again next year and try to claim that record-breaking third win in the race, it would be brilliant.” Bath 1.40 Hieronymous 2.10 Jeanie B 2.45 Stag Horn 3.20 Diamond Hill 3.50 Quel Destin 4.25 Lady Alavesa 4.55 Manucci Wetherby 1.50 Paricolor 2.20 Maria Magdalena 2.55 Beakstown (nap) 3.30 West Cork 4.00 Sky Pirate 4.35 Victarion 5.05 Sir Egbert (nb) 5.35 Antunes Nottingham 1.55 Zegalo 2.30 So I Told You 3.05 King’s Charisma 3.40 Junooh 4.10 Ventura Flame 4.45 Afandem 5.15 Valentino Sunrise Kempton 4.40 Twilighting 5.10 Pepper Bay 5.40 Pearl Jam 6.10 Cobber Kain 6.40 Khuzaam 7.10 Redemptive 7.40 Sagittarian Wind 8.10 Mabo Southwell 5.25 Vallarta 5.55 Born To Destroy 6.25 Awa Bomba 6.55 Samovar 7.25 Lofty 7.55 Feebi 8.25 Break The Silence A decision is expected on Wednesday morning about which track will be used for the three round-course races at Ascot on Saturday. If an inspection reveals that the usual flat course remains waterlogged, officials are likely to announce the Champions Day action will be moved on to the inner flat course, which is normally reserved for hurdle races.
