A Scottish court has delayed a decision on whether Boris Johnson should be forced to ask for a Brexit extension until after the final deadline has passed next week. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the three judges, the lord president, Lord Carloway, Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young, to issue court orders forcing Johnson to send the letter to the EU required under the so-called Benn act. That legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, requires Johnson to write to the EU asking for an extension until 31 January if he fails to get a Brexit deal agreed at Westminster by 19 October. They had also asked the court to use its unique powers, known as nobile officium, to write that letter on his behalf if he failed to do so.
