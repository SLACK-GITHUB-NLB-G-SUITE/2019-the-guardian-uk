As an importer of goods from Europe I have received several communications from the government over the last six months urging me to apply for something called an EORI number, which will enable me to continue trading in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Until recently I ignored them, assuming that no deal was unlikely. But last month I received a letter from the government advising me, once again, that I needed this number. Given the new prime minister’s enthusiasm for jumping off the cliff, I deemed it wise to apply. I filled in the online form with copious information about myself that the government already has, and submitted my application. Ten days later, I received an email from HMRC informing me: “We have not issued a new EORI number because Simon Fairlie already has one. This was issued by HMRC on 17.12.2018.” This was news to me – and if they had issued one, why were they posting letters urging me to apply? As for the EORI number, it turned out to be nothing more than my VAT number with three zeros tacked on the end. Why had I needed to apply for that? Why such a fuss? That was the end of it, I thought, until four days later the government emailed me again with the news that: “Your EORI application has been unsuccessful – if you need help, phone our support team.” I don’t think I shall phone these clowns. The UK cannot be so stupid as to go down a route for which it is so ill-prepared. If it does, I’m glad I’m approaching retirement age.Simon FairlieCharmouth, Dorset • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
