The new British-Japanese Fabula Collective arrive as an unknown quantity, but the draw of this mixed bill is that two of the choreographers are ex-dancers with Wayne McGregor – an employer of inquisitive minds as well as exquisite bodies. There’s not much McGregor copycatting here though, especially in the better works. James Pett’s Man of the Crowd, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, is a solo that sees him wrestling with identity and self, struggling to be at peace in the world. That sounds like the kind of cliche you read often in earnest dance blurbs, but when Pett does it, you believe him. It is in no way intended as an insult to the choreographers to say that one of the most impressive things about this show is the lighting, from designer Petr Vocka. In Pett’s solo, lights shift his character to a different place or headspace without him even moving; in Japanese choreographer Kihako Narisawa’s duet a.é.p.s, Vocka conjures a crepuscular glow while allowing us to see perfectly the subtle details and timbre of Narisawa and Claudio Costantino’s movement. It’s a piece in which the dancers feel like real people in a real relationship; not much happens, but it contains multitudes. In Pett’s duet with Travis Clausen-Knight, Informal Between, Vocka enhances choreography already designed to make these dancers look beautiful, casting highlights along the edges of the pair’s bodies, whether in sculptural poses, the spiralling traces of a corkscrew turn, or just the sharp diagonals of their model cheekbones. Clausen-Knight’s trio Salt to Water is a less convincing piece – not so much in terms of what the dancers are doing, but why – but in general, this is a promising debut.
