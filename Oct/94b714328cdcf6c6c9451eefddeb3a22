Sayeeda Warsi is wrong to say the Policy Exchange fringe meeting at Tory party conference was a “Muslim-bashing fest” (The Tories do not care about Islamophobia, Journal, 1 October). I was a panellist and can confirm that not a single speaker attacked the Muslim community; though some did critique Islamist extremism. Every speaker, including two Muslim women, condemned anti-Muslim prejudice. Two of us questioned parliament’s sweeping definition of Islamophobia as a potential threat to free speech. That’s all. Being named “Islamophobe of the Year” was joked about because it was awarded by what I regard as an Islamist group that opposes human rights and supports the tyrannical Iranian regime. Hence my sarcastic joke. I criticised Tory anti-Muslim prejudice, urged an inquiry into it, defended Muslim communities and made concrete proposals to protect Muslims against discrimination and hate crime.Peter TatchellDirector, Peter Tatchell Foundation • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
