Late-night hosts covered Donald Trump’s questionable comments about the impeachment inquiry. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host took a closer look at Trump’s recent behaviour and his strange attempts to cover himself. Trump recently claimed he wasn’t pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on his phone call where he spoke about Joe Biden and his son. He said that it wasn’t pressure because he “knows when he gives pressure”. “What does that mean?” Meyers asked. “I know when I give pressure. Trump’s only defence is I know when I commit a crime and that’s not a crime.” Trump has also said that Nancy Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry before she read the transcript of the call, and after reading it she allegedly regretted what she started, as it was such a great call. “At this point he’s just writing fan fiction about Nancy Pelosi,” he said. But Trump’s strangest soundbite arrived when he spoke to press by the chopper on Thursday and said he thinks Ukraine and China should both investigate Hunter Biden. “He basically just blew the whistle on himself,” he said. “He should have a whistle around his neck at all times.” Trump has also brought up the fact that Mike Pence has spoken to Zelensky and his calls are also being looked at. “No one deserves to be dragged down by Trump more than Mike Pence,” he said. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Trump’s inability to keep quiet. “The constitution gives the accused the right to remain silent and clearly, Donald Trump has never read the constitution because he will not shut the old hamburger hole,” he said. Colbert said that the more Trump reveals, it “just makes him guiltier”. He also referenced the chopper talk where he implicated himself. “That is literally what they’re impeaching you for!” he said. “Don’t say that out loud!” He also joked about Trump now bringing China into the conversation. “Just when you think Trump can’t dig himself a deeper hole, he literally reaches China.” This week also saw Trump visiting The Villages in Florida, a retirement community that has been referred to as an adult Disney World. During a speech, Trump joked that he should be retiring with the audience. “Yes, you should … and Nancy Pelosi’s working on it,” Colbert quipped. Colbert also referred to Trump as “the conspiracy theorist in chief” as he played a clip of him ranting about how he believed that pharmaceutical companies are planting hoaxes to try and bring him down. Colbert urged him not to cause problems with them – “anti-depressants are the only thing getting me through your administration”. Mike Pence has a convenient history of being unaware of Trump’s major scandals 🤔 pic.twitter.com/YE3L4SQlCz On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked that impeachment is “the ‘Thank u, next’ of politics” before also bringing up Trump’s confessional. “This guy is unbelievable,” he said. “He’s already facing impeachment for asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and now he’s like ‘You know what, China get in on it.’” He continued: “Trump might be the only person on Earth who thinks two wrongs make a right.” Noah also spoke about how Pence is slowly being implicated, listing the various ways that suggest he knows more then he is claiming. “Pence was so deep in this thing, I bet Mother would consider this cheating,” he joked. Noah added: “Trump is Homer Simpson and he basically picked Ned Flanders as his VP.” Pence’s aides have said that he was unaware of anything nefarious going on and Noah then played a montage of Pence claiming he was unaware of every wrong thing Trump has done since he became president. “He’s like every mom watching a movie,” he said. Noah continued: “If that’s true then that’s actually not good for America. Because you realise if Trump gets kicked out then Pence is president but clearly he has no idea what’s going on.”
