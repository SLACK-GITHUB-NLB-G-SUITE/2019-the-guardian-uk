Harvey Neville, son of the England Women manager Phil Neville, has been called up by the Republic of Ireland Under-19s for Friday’s friendly against Denmark in Sligo. The 17-year-old defender, a youth player at Manchester United, qualifies for Ireland through his maternal grandmother. He has never represented the country. Ireland finished fourth in July’s Under-19 European Championship, losing in the semi-finals to Portugal. Neville joined Manchester United, for whom his father made 263 appearances, in July 2018 after leaving Valencia, where his father was a coach and his uncle Gary was manager. Phil Neville won 59 England caps. Other new call-ups to the Ireland squad include the Germany-born forward Conor Noss, an 18-year-old included in Borussia Mönchengladbach’s first-team squad for last weekend’s Bundesliga game against Augsburg.
