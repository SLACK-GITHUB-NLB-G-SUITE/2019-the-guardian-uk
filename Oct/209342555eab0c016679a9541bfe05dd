A fascinating, absorbing Cesarewitch may fall to Mr Everest (4.10), who will hopefully get a smoother run through the Newmarket contest than he did in the Irish equivalent last year. He did well to get third at Navan that day and showed his ability in a similarly valuable handicap at Naas the following month. Tony Martin has largely kept this talented type off the Flat this year and he warmed up for this with a spin over hurdles at Listowel. He is well treated, well drawn and good value at the 16-1 available on Friday evening, though that may come under pressure overnight. 2.20 Newmarket The Zetland Stakes may fall to Aidan O’Brien for a third straight year, thanks to Mythical. He’s a big, green colt and perhaps these undulations will catch him out but his Gowran performance hinted at plenty of ability. 2.40 York We haven’t seen him for a while but it’s worth remembering how much promise was in the Goodwood maiden success of Cobra Eye during the Glorious meeting in late July. The next three horses have all won since and he was declared for the Acomb Stakes at the Ebor meeting here before becoming a late non-runner. This is not such a demanding next step and he has two siblings who won at this level. 2.55 Newmarket With so much unexposed potential on offer, much may depend on which of these juveniles gets the run of the race. Bearing in mind that the stalls are against the stands’ rail, one possibility is that Military March will go straight into the lead from his high draw and the Godolphin runner could be hard to catch. He made a pleasing debut on the July Course in high summer and is bred to do much better with time and distance. 3.15 York A first stab at 10 furlongs turned into an unfortunate Goodwood experience for Coolagh Forest but things went better for him at this track a month ago, when he beat 14 rivals by daylight. He looks a more reliable proposition than Harrovian. 3.30 Newmarket As we saw in Paris last weekend, the very best horses can be vulnerable if conditions are not quite right, so caution is appropriate as Pinatubo faces rain-softened ground for the first time. That being said, Friday’s action did not suggest this surface is worse than good to soft and Charlie Appleby’s star should be able to win this Dewhurst if anywhere close to the form we have seen from him. Wichita has course experience but this is a lot tougher than the Group Three he won here last month. 3.50 York Beaten only by a well-treated younger rival in the Ayr Gold Cup, Growl could get his day in the limelight. That game effort was his best in a busy year and of course he’s been raised a few pounds but he’s still more than a stone below his peak rating. Some of his best efforts have come on soft, including his fourth place in the Stewards’ Cup a couple of seasons ago.
