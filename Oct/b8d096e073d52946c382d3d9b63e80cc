Australia romped to a world record 18th consecutive one-day international victory behind another brilliant Alyssa Healy century in Brisbane. The hosts chased Sri Lanka’s 195-8 with ease on Wednesday at Allan Border Field, losing just one wicket as they reached the target in the 27th over. Healy (112no from 76 balls) brought up her third ODI hundred, but first on home soil, in 71 balls while last-game century maker Rachael Haynes (63 from 74) stuck with her in a 159-run opening stand. The wicketkeeper sealed the contest with a cleanly-hit six over long-on to cap a dominant run against the tourists, highlighted by a T20 record unbeaten 148 off just 61 balls last week in Sydney. The victory continued Australia’s two-year unbeaten streak in the format and saw them go past the 17-game record set by Belinda Clark’s Australian team in the late 1990s. The national squad will now break for the WBBL, which begins next Friday, before the T20 World Cup on home soil next year. Australia’s men own the outright ODI record with 21 straight victories, set in 2003. But Lanning’s side can match that streak with a clean-sweep of their three-game series in South Africa in March, when they next play 50-over cricket. Australia were clinical against the world No 8 side, the gap in class obvious as both openers preyed on the visitor’s pace attack in ideal batting conditions. Sri Lanka weren’t completely powerless though, with standout Chamari Atapattu backing up her brilliant T20 century from earlier in the tour with another hundred after her side won the toss. The opener hung in as wickets fell around her and the run-rate slowed, finishing with 103 from 128 balls in an innings that featured some exquisite cover driving. A collapse of 3-2, triggered by leg-spinner Georgia Wareham’s (2-18) probing four-over spell, halted Sri Lanka’s bright start though and the Australians didn’t look back.
