James Forrest celebrated his new contract with a goal as Celtic beat St Mirren 2-0 at Parkhead to remain top of the table on goal difference after Rangers beat Ross County 4-0. The winger netted Celtic’s second goal in quick succession just after the interval, hours after signing a one-year contract extension which ties him to the club until 2023. The 28-year-old came closest to breaking the first-half deadlock as St Mirren defended in numbers and displayed good skill and composure to net in the 54th minute. Mohamed Elyounoussi had opened the scoring five minutes earlier from close range as Celtic responded to three first-half goals from Rangers at Ross County to ultimately ensure they remain top of the Premiership by one goal. Rangers ripped County apart in their lopsided match at the Global Energy Stadium. On a freezing night in Dingwall, Colombia striker Alfredo Morelos got the visitors up and running in the 20th minute when he knocked in a pass from Sheyi Ojo for his 17th goal of the season. Returning midfielder Ryan Jack scored twice to have the Light Blues on easy street by the interval. Morelos grabbed his second with a drive to make it 4-0 and keep Steven Gerrard’s side behind Celtic on goal difference. Motherwell moved into third place with an unconvincing 2-1 win against 10-man Kilmarnock, while luckless Hearts captain Christophe Berra’s own goal piled on the misery for Craig Levein as they were beaten 1-0 by St Johnstone. Martin Boyle enjoyed a fairytale return from injury to spare Hibernian’s blushes in a breathless 2-2 draw against Livingston.
