The Divorce Reform Act 1969 changed British families forever – 50 years on, we want to talk to the children of divorced parents from every decade since, about how it affected their lives and their relationships then and now. We’d like to hear from a wide range of Guardian readers, ideally some of whom will be happy to be photographed, about their experiences of divorce in order to build a picture of how divorce and perceptions of it have changed in the past 50 years. If you would like to share your story, please fill in the encrypted form below. How did your parents’ divorce affect you and your relationships? We will feature a selection of your submissions.
