Enable remains odds-on at 4-5 for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday after being drawn in stall nine for Europe’s showpiece event. Charlie Appleby’s Ghaiyyath, however, has drifted in the betting after being handed the widest draw in stall 12, a difficult starting position for a horse that seems best when he can get to the lead.Last year’s Arc showed the potential importance of the draw at Longchamp, as Sea Of Class, from stall 15, narrowly failed to overhaul Enable, from five, after being forced to drop in at the rear of the field. The smallest Arc field since 2007 should mean it is less significant on Sunday, giving Enable every chance to make history as the first horse to win the race three times. Three of the four horses at the head of the ante-post betting were drawn towards the outside, with Japan and Ryan Moore immediately to Enable’s left in 10. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, is the only leading contender with a low stall, against the rail in one. Magical, a stable companion of Japan at the Aidan O’Brien yard, is alongside him in stall eight, while Waldgeist, who will be André Fabre’s only runner as the trainer seeks a record eighth Arc victory, is drawn in three.Ghaiyyath, who took the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden by 14 lengths last time out, eased from 10-1 to 12-1 with several layers after the draw on Thursday, having made most or all of the running to win both in Germany and in the Prix d’Harcourt at Longchamp in April. His only defeat this year came in the Prix Ganay, again at Longchamp, when he was unable to dominate and while William Buick, his big-race jockey, has suggested this week that his mount is “not one-dimensional”, a soft lead on Sunday now looks highly unlikely.
