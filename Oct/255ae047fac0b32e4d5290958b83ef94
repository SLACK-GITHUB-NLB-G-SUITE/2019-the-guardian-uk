Jack Rodwell is to have a medical at Roma on Friday with a view to signing until the end of the season, four months after he left Blackburn Rovers as a free agent. The 28-year-old is regarded by Roma, who are sixth in Serie A and top of their Europa League group, as a solution to a midfield injury crisis. The former England international can also play at centre-half. Rodwell’s departure from Blackburn came after he made 21 Championship appearances in his one season there. The club held talks over a contract extension but were unable to strike a deal with the former Everton, Manchester City and Sunderland player. Roma’s squad includes another former England international, Chris Smalling, who is on loan from Manchester United.
