As the clocks go back and evening skies darken, outdoor events take on a special atmosphere, whether they are on city streets, up mountains or in forests. Please share details of your favourite winter festivals in the UK and across Europe. They could involve celebrations based around local produce, traditions going back centuries, light festivals or a lent carnival knees up. We’re not looking for Christmas festivals or markets this time, however – that’s a category of its own. Please include details of exact locations with any relevant websites and price information. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 22 October 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here. Read the terms and conditions
