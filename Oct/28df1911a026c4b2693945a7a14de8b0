We go into a high-street bank and we are expected to conduct all of our own transactions. Next to no personal service. Now we discover that communities have to apply to a fund if they want access to their own money (Need a cash machine? Apply to the £1m fund, 2 October). I am absolutely clear on the need for the banking system to be profitable, and I understand the changing use of cash, cheques etc. However, this cavalier, take-it-or-leave-it approach to their customers demonstrates an inbuilt belief in and acceptance of their virtual monopoly of the money system. The fund has £1m to share. How many communities will that satisfy? The banking system needs to get a grip and start looking at its collective reputation.Margaret ProsserLabour, House of Lords • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
