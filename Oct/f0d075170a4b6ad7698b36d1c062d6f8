Three years ago, I had a miscarriage and I am still heartbroken. It’s been made harder by my in-laws giving me the cold shoulder. Not long after my loss, my mother-in-law asked if I was uncomfortable seeing my sister-in-law (who was pregnant with her third child). I answered honestly that I was, and added in an unguarded moment that I felt it unfair that she was able to get pregnant while I struggled. Since then they have avoided me. I asked my mother-in-law about it and she said they didn’t want to see me “in case they said something wrong”. My husband thinks they will come around eventually but I feel as if I’m being punished and constantly reminded of what was the saddest time of my life. I really don’t know how to move forward. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
