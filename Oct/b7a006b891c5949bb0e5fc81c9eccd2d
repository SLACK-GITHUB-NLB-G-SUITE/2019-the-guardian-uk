Harriet Dyer. She is an atom bomb of explosive comedy eccentricity. Norris and Parker being sex witches. I saw their last show so many times. Not out of choice; I lived with them and they performed often. My sister, Lulu. When I was in hospital last year after my discs prolapsed and I couldn’t walk, feel my legs or control my bladder, Lulu told me to “stop being a drama queen” and said: “Put it in perspective, at least you don’t have leprosy.” A child once said: “Why are you doing this to us?” at a Comedy Club 4 Kids gig. When I was 15 I used to have cornrows. Because I wanted to be a rapper. I will let that settle in. I don’t eat food that is the colour red. Some people think that is funny. I don’t know why. Tomatoes make me cry. Two months ago, I dreamed I married Stormzy and we remade the Saw films as a musical. We had a baby together and when I woke up and realised it wasn’t real I wept because I was so proud of the work we had made together. In that dream we were visionaries. Plop.
