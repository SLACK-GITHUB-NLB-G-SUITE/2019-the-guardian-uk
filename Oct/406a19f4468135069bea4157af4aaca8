An armed man has stolen an ambulance in Oslo, injuring three people including two babies when he drove off and hit a family, Norwegian police and hospital officials have said. The man was apprehended after police fired shots at the vehicle. The suspect was not critically injured. “Two babies were injured after the hijacked ambulance hit a family. They are twins, seven months old, and they are being treated,” an Oslo University hospital spokesman said. The public broadcaster NRK showed images of an ambulance driving in the Torshov neighbourhood of Oslo as several gunshots rang out. The hospital spokesman said two ambulances were involved. “One was hijacked by an armed person with a shotgun. Some minutes later one of our other ambulances managed to stop the hijacked vehicle by crashing into it. Then the police came after the crash and got him,” he said. The police declined to comment on whether the incident was being treated as a deliberate attack. “An armed man stole an ambulance, drove away and hit some people. We’ve got him now,” the police spokesman said.
