Hans Teeuwen on my first visit to the [Edinburgh] fringe as a punter in 2010. I laughed so hard I fell off my chair. When I was a teenager my dad handed me a book wrapped up tightly in a bag and said: “You’re going to be experiencing some … changes, so this might … help.” I opened the bag to find the book was called Everything You Ever Wanted to Ask About Willies. I couldn’t breathe the first time I watched The Eric Andre Show. Really well thought-out, deeply intense insanity. The outtakes from Liar Liar. Not the film. A man put his hand up and asked me for two more pints of Carling. I said it wasn’t really my job and he said: “But you’re working here tonight, so it is.” I woke up in tears of laughter a few years ago, certain I’d dreamed the greatest joke of all time, which I excitedly wrote down. When morning came, I saw I’d just written: “Dog facepaint.” Unlikely to open with it. Ombudsman. Never written a show without an ombudsman in it at least once. They pop up twice in the new show, so they’re not going away any time soon. Glenn Moore plays Edinburgh, Sat; Glasgow, Sun; Reading, Fri; touring to 23 Jan
