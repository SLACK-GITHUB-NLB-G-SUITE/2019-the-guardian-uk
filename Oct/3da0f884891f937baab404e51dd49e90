What an enthralling collection of Other Lives (Obituaries, 28 October). We mere mortals standing on the sidelines can only be grateful to these champions of British agriculture, academia, publishing, education, social policy, design and nursing. And not a little concerned that valuing such achievements seems sadly out of step with the current lie of the land.Richard LeeLeigh-on-Sea, Essex • I have rarely read such a moving, insightful and accurate account of grief in such a succinct piece of writing (In grief, I have found unexpected comforts, G2, 29 October). Suzanne Moore recognises and acknowledges the human response to intense grief, and takes a simple, down-to-earth approach that provided comfort to me and I am sure to many others reading it. Thank you.Jan SmithBrighton • In the 1960s, we were told that a notice in the local Catholic church read “Any woman wishing to join the Union of Catholic Mothers, please see the priest after mass” (Letters, 26 October).James HerringDunbar, East Lothian • Posters in the window of our local hardware shop had been advertising fireworks for sale to “celebrate Brexit on 31 October”. Yesterday morning, they were gone. Bit of a damp squib? Lots of ditch-digging equipment still available, however.Christopher GrahamHale, Greater Manchester • Is it safe to eat my Brexit hoard yet? (Four tins of baked beans… not all at once, obviously.)Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
