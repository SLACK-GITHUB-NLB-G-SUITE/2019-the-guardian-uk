The candidate backed by several opposition parties has been elected mayor of Budapest, in a blow to nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party. With 74% of the votes counted in Budapest, Gergely Karacsony was leading Istvan Tarlos by 50.1% to 44.8%. Shortly after, Tarlos, the ruling party incumbent, conceded defeat on Sunday night. “On the national level the result is nice but in Budapest, there is thinking to be done,” Tarlos told a news conference flanked by Orbán, the prime minister. “Budapest made the decision to elect Gergely Karacsony today.” Despite Tarlos’s reference to the national picture, opposition parties were also projected to win mayoral races in around 10 of the country’s 23 largest cities in nationwide local elections. In 2014, they won just three of those races. At nearly 50%, Sunday’s voting had one of the highest voter turnouts in local elections since Hungary’s 1990 return to democracy. Despite the disappointing results, analysts said they expect Orbán, who led his party to landslide victories in all major elections since 2010, to continue with his combative style, which includes strong anti-migrant policies, increasing domination of the media and a centralised power structure built around the prime minister’s office.
