Miami Dolphins safety Bobby McCain will be disciplined by the team for his verbal confrontation with a 13-year-old boy who was rooting for the Buffalo Bills. According to the Buffalo News, the incident occurred before the Dolphins’ loss at the Bills on Sunday. The publication says the boy had been heckling McCain and called him “irrelevant”. The player then allegedly threatened to spit at the teenager “It’s a serious allegation,” Undersheriff Mark Wipperman, the incident commander for Bills home games, told the newspaper. Another Bills fan, Dylan Wentland, said McCain then spat at him after the game after he had defended the boy. Wipperman said no security staff witnessed the incident. However, several fans said they saw McCain spit in Wentland’s face and provided statements to deputies. Dolphins coach Brian Flores said he discussed the incident with McCain on Monday. Flores wouldn’t say whether McCain will miss playing time as part of the disciplinary action.
