Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My partner has generously volunteered me to host a Halloween party for a gang of 11-year-old girls. I can’t leave the country, so I need some top ideas on how to pull this off – all on a super-low budget. What’s made your previous parties go with a bang? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
