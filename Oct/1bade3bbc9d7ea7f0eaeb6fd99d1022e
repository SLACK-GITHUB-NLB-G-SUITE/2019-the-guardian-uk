The beauty of knowing a city is that you know where to venture beyond the high street. One of Paul A Young’s shops sits, almost missable, in London’s tiny Camden Passage, parallel to Islington’s main shopping street. It is a dark, enchanting little shop where your entrance is immediately noted and you fear a thoughtless turnaround could send chocolates scattering. I had set myself a budget: £20, and while I wanted the safety, and lack of interaction, of simply selecting chocolate bars, the dots of individual filled chocolates on display - ready to be lifted into boxes by a chocolatier - invited questions. The staff are super friendly and simply asking what they all were was an adventure in itself. I started choosing four, but realised a fuller experience, worthy of a chocolate correspondent really needed nine (£15.50). The sea salted caramel has been voted the best in the world and I wouldn’t argue with that – the ratio of salted caramel to chocolate was perfect. (I am not usually a fan of salted caramel as I’m bored to death with them.) Each fresh filled chocolate was a joy, even those I didn’t like, because every one is an exquisite journey into the unknown. I wouldn’t care if I never again tasted the harissa and tahini or peanut butter jelly, but I am so glad they exist. Flavours change often. October brings various new joys, such as plum crumble and custard, and Sussex pudding. The filled chocolates are freshly made and they recommend you eat them within seven days. Mine lasted 48 hours. I left the shop feeling like I’d travelled the world.
