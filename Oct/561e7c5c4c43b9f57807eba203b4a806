Wildlife officials in Thailand have discovered the carcasses of five more wild elephants downstream from a waterfall where the bodies of six other elephants were found last weekend. The carcasses were discovered by a drone being used to investigate how the first six elephants plunged to their deaths at the Haew Narok waterfall, known as the Ravine of Hell, in Khao Yai national park in central Thailand, said Sompote Maneerat, spokesman for the national parks, wildlife and plant conservation department. Park officials said the first group of elephants died trying to reach a dead calf. The newly discovered victims are thought to have come from the same herd. The ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season. Maneerat said the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai, where the elephant population is estimated to be about 300. Eight elephants died at the same waterfall almost 30 years ago.
