Unified welterweight champion Errol Spence Jr is expected to survive after he was seriously injured in a one-car accident early on Thursday morning in Dallas, according to authorities. The Dallas police department said a white Ferrari was traveling “at a high rate of speed” northbound on Riverfront Boulevard near Interstate 80 just before 3am when it veered left over the center median onto the southbound lanes, flipped multiple times and ejected Spence, who was not wearing a seatbelt. “His injuries are not life-threatening. His parents are with him at the hospital,” Tim Smith, a spokesman for Spence’s promoter, Premier Boxing Champions, told the Associated Press. #BREAKING Sources confirm boxer #ErrolSpence seriously injured in overnight crash along Riverfront Blvd. He was ejected from the car. @DanGodwinFOX4 live with the latest @GoodDayFox4 @FOX4 pic.twitter.com/68mYiogZGs Police said they are continuing to investigate the cause of the accident. Spence, a 2012 US Olympian and native of the Dallas suburb of DeSoto, is widely regarded as one of the world’s best pound-for-pound boxers. He unified the IBF and WBC welterweight championships with a thrilling split-decision victory over Shawn Porter last month in Los Angeles, improving his professional record to 26-0 with 21 knockouts and cementing himself as a pay-per-view attraction. My dad always tells me “this boxing thing is a part of your life but it’s not going to last forever. U still have a lot of life to live after that.” With that, I'm praying for @ErrolSpenceJr & his family because he has a lot of life to live and I pray he recovers quickly & fully. On Thursday, Porter tweeted his support for Spence. “I’m praying for @ErrolSpenceJr & his family because he has a lot of life to live and I pray he recovers quickly & fully,” he wrote.
