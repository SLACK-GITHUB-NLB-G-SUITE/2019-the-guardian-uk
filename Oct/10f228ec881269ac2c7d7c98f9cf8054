The fierce rivalry between Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation and John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud moved from the racecourse to the sales ring, as the sport’s biggest players engaged in a bidding war for a Dubawi half-brother to Group One winner Barney Roy on the first day of Tattersalls’ prestigious Book 1 sale. The winning bid of 3.6m gns [£3.78m], eventually made on behalf of Godolphin, was the highest price paid for a yearling in Europe this year. He is the most expensive purchase for Godolphin at Book 1 since Sheikh Mohammed paid 4m gns for the filly Gloam in 2017. “We knew he was a lovely horse but you don’t expect that sort of figure when you go in there,” said Adrian O’Brien, from the consignor Hazelwood Bloodstock. “I’m blown away. To be honest, when we got up around the million I was quite satisfied and the rest was just an amazing experience, to watch those figures go up. “I think Coolmore was the under-bidder and it’s what every consignor dreams of to get Darley [Sheikh Mohammed] and Coolmore on one. He’s been beautiful from day one.” Earlier, a colt by Dubawi out of the Group One-winning mare The Fugue was the first lot to be knocked down for a seven-figure price as Tattersalls’ October Book 1 Sale, Europe’s most prestigious yearling auction, got under way in Newmarket. David Redvers, bidding on behalf of Qatar Racing, made the final bid of 1m gns. He will join John Gosden, who trained The Fugue to win four Group One races for Lord Lloyd-Webber. It is the second year running that Redvers has gone to seven figures at Book 1 for a Dubawi yearling from Lloyd-Webber’s Watership Down Stud. Kevin Ryan, who has enjoyed -several valuable successes during his first two seasons training for leading owner Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, secured another seven-figure colt to run in the Sheikh’s colours, paying 1m gns for a half-brother to the Group One winners, Tamarkuz and Without Parole. The new jumps season gets under way a week earlier than expected at Wincanton, when the track will stage one of the final fixtures transferred from now-defunct Towcester (the last “Towcester” fixture of all, in case anyone wants to mark it, was scheduled for 19 December). The flat Somerset track could hardly offer more of a contrast with the famously demanding uphill finish at Towcester, a reminder of the important variety that is lost whenever a course closes, but it is also one of the most popular smaller venues in the game and will hopefully pull in a decent crowd thanks to a flat-rate £10 ticket. Oleg (3.10) will take plenty of beating in the novice handicap chase, while it is a slight surprise to find Romanor (3.45) as the outsider of six runners in the handicap hurdle. Capitaine is the class act in the field, having won a Grade Two novice hurdle back in December 2016, and running for the first time since a wind-op too, but this is his first start since May and he is giving at least 12lb to all five of his opponents. Romanor should have a fitness edge and has been running well over the summer, including at Plumpton last time when he was given plenty to do. He has dropped another 2lb in the ratings and looks over-priced at around 15-2. Gone Platinum (1.15) and Misty Bloom (1.45) should both go well on the day’s other jumps card at Ludlow, while Duke Of Condicote (2.55) has been well backed overnight for the nursery at Nottingham. He improved when fifth on heavy ground at Goodwood last time and 73 is a very fair opening mark for Alan King’s colt. Marnie James (6.40) is also worth close inspection at Kempton. He was down the field in the Portland Handicap last time but had previously put up a couple of big runs for his new trainer, Jedd O’Keeffe, following a mid-season switch from Iain Jardine. There was only a six-day gap between the second and third starts for O’Keeffe and a slightly longer break may see a return to his best form.
