Mason Crosby nailed a 23-yard field goal as time expired, and the Green Bay Packers benefited from some questionable officiating to edge the Detroit Lions 23-22 on Monday night. Aaron Rodgers completed 24 of 39 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns, including a beautiful 35-yard throw to Allen Lazard for the receiver’s first career touchdown. Rodgers linked up with Jamaal Williams for the other touchdown. Williams finished with 104 yards on 14 carries for Green Bay, who captured their first win in five tries against their NFC North rivals. If anything, Packers LT David Bakhtiari had HIS hands in Trey Flowers' face on these two plays #DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/exnuYckIJK The Packers might not have pulled it off if not for two penalties for illegal hands to the face against Detroit’s Trey Flowers, the second of which allowed Green Bay to run the clock down to two seconds before Crosby’s game-winner. In both cases, replays showed Flowers’ hands on the neck or shoulder of a Packers lineman. Matt Prater was good from 26, 22, 41, 51 and 54 yards for the Lions (2-2-1). Matthew Stafford finished 18 of 32 for 265 yards and was sacked three times. Kerryon Johnson scored the lone touchdown for the Lions from 1 yard out in the first quarter.
