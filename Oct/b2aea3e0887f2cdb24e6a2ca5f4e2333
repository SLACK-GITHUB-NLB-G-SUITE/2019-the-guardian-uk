Valencia were prevented from joining Chelsea and Ajax on six points at the top of Group H by a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Lille. Jonathan Ikoné struck five minutes into stoppage time for the French side after Valencia went ahead through Denis Cheryshev and later had Mouctar Diakhaby sent off for two bookable offences. In Group E, Napoli won 3-2 away to Red Bull Salzburg. Dries Mertens overtook Diego Maradona to become the second-highest goalscorer in the Italian club’s history with a brace in Austria. Lorenzo Insigne claimed the winner for Carlo Ancelotti’s side while exciting 19-year-old Erling Haaland’s brace was not enough for the hosts. Lionel Messi made more Champions League history as Barcelona scraped an unconvincing 2-1 success at Slavia Prague to move top of Group F. Messi became the first player to score in 15 consecutive seasons of the competition by putting the visitors ahead inside three minutes. The Czech champions deservedly levelled through Jan Boril early in the second half but Barça secured a sixth successive win in all competitions thanks to a fortuitous own goal from Peter Olayinka. Borussia Dortmund surrendered first place in the group to Barcelona following their 2-0 loss to Internazionale. Goals from Lautaro Martínez and Antonio Candreva earned victory for Antonio Conte’s men at San Siro. The Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Bürki saved a Martínez penalty. In Group G, RB Leipzig came from behind to beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 after second-half goals from Konrad Laimer and a brilliant winner from Marcel Sabitzer overturned Yaroslav Rakitskiy’s opener. Benfica beat Lyon 2-1 in the other game in that group, with Pizzi claiming an 86th-minute winner after Memphis Depay cancelled out Rafa Silva’s early opener.
