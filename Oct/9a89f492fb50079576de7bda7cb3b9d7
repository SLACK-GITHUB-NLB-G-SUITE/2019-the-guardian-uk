Put 1kg of assorted tomatoes into a roasting tin, tuck in 6 sprigs of thyme, season with black pepper and trickle over 5 tbsp of olive oil. Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft and their skins lightly browned in places. Finely chop 2 tbsp of tarragon leaves and the same of basil. Mash 150g of goat’s cheese with a fork and then stir in 100g of crème fraîche. Add the chopped herbs and a little pepper then chill until needed. When the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and transfer to a serving plate. Toss 100g of samphire into the tomato roasting juices in the tin then add next to the tomatoes on the serving plate. Spoon the herbed cheese into a small bowl then serve with pieces of crusty white baguette to soak up the juices. Enough for 2. To get the full sweet, sharp and smoky flavour of the tomatoes, roast them until their skins start to blacken here and there. Serve them hot, straight from the oven to contrast with the chilled whipped cheese. The tomatoes can be replaced by aubergines. Cut them into large cubes, then add to the roasting tin with the thyme and olive oil and bake for a good half hour or so, turning them as they burnish and soften. Season with a sprinkling of za’atar, fresh mint and serve with the whipped cheese and samphire. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
