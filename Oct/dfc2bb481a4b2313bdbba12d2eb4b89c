Police have been called to an incident at Conservative party conference understood to involve an MP. Officers were asked to attend the international lounge at the conference in Manchester on Tuesday lunchtime after reports of an incident believed to involve Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Tory source confirmed. The 66-year-old backbencher, who represents The Cotswolds, was knighted in 2018. He did not deny the reports, and told PA Media: “I’ve got nothing further to say about it. I don’t want to comment on it, really.” Paramedics were in attendance and security staff shut down entrances and exits into the media lounge and covered the glass window leading into the lounge for about 30 minutes. The Conservative party was due to release a statement shortly. Guests going in and out of the lounge, which is for international visitors to the event, said they had not seen anything happen or the police being called. In a statement, Greater Manchester police said: “At around 1.45pm on Tuesday 1 October 2019, an attendee to the Conservative party conference attempted to enter the international lounge area of the conference without the relevant pass. “Security staff intervened and resolved the situation without any breach of security occurring.”
