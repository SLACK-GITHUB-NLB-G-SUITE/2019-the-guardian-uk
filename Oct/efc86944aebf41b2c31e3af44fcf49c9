The actor Felicity Huffman has been released three days early from her 14-day prison sentence, according to a report. A prison official told NBC News that the Desperate Housewives star was let out after just 11 days as it is normal policy for inmates who are set to be released on weekends. The Oscar-nominated actor had been serving time for her role in the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal. Huffman pleaded guilty after admitting that she paid for her daughter’s college test to be taken by someone else, disguising a $15,000 bribe as a charitable payment. “I accept the court’s decision today without reservation,” Huffman said after her sentencing. “I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.” On top of her prison sentence, Huffman was also ordered to pay a $30,000 fine and commit to 250 hours of community service. The investigation found more than 50 people were involved in the scheme, including the Full House actor Lori Loughlin. Along with her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, she’s accused of arranging a total payment of $500,000 in order to get her daughters into the University of Southern California. This week the couple were hit with new charges of bribery which could lead to a 50-year prison sentence. “Our goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,” said the US attorney Andrew E Lelling. “The superseding indictments will further that effort.” Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty to the previous charges and will probably be headed to trial next year.
