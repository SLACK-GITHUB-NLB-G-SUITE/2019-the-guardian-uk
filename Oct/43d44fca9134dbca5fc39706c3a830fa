John Millman finished short of claiming his first ATP title after losing the final of the Japan Open in straight sets to Novak Djokovic. The Australian was no match for the world No.1, going down 6-3 6-2. It was still an excellent week for Millman, who is expected to get a rankings boost from No.80 to No.58 in the world as well as a pay day of $A289,000. The 30 year-old enjoyed a remarkable run through to what was just his second ATP final, winning a total of six matches including two in qualifying. He had survived three match points in his opening-round qualifier against American Bradley Klahn, but powered through the draw which opened up nicely for him as seeded players such as Borna Coric and Benoit Paire fell by the wayside. Millman started confidently and pushed Djokovic in the opening service game on Sunday but was effectively playing catch-up for most of the set. Djokovic required just one break in the fourth game to eventually take it 6-3. Things started inauspiciously for the Queenslander in the second, getting broken after holding a 40-15 advantage. From there, it was all Djokovic as he charged through the set to claim his first title in Tokyo, fourth of the year and 76th of his career.
