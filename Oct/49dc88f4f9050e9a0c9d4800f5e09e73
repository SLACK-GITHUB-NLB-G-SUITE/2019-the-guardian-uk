Many people will feel sympathy with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in connection with the revelation of her unhappiness over press exposure (I was told tabloids would destroy my life, Meghan reveals, 21 October). However, this story, along with the humiliation of the Queen over the prorogation scandal, should make us all reconsider the role of the monarchy in modern British life. No one would deny that the Queen has worked hard to discharge her role, but one has to wonder if the monarchy really has any place in today’s world. Many changes in the British constitution are clearly required. We should be looking at the example of flourishing countries such as France or Germany, where the head of state is elected, not given the job because of the circumstances of their birth.Rev Andrew McLuskeyAshford, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
