Catherine Shoard begins her panegyric on “visionary” film-maker Jonathan Glazer (G2, 28 October) by dismissing what immediately preceded his startling The Fall as “an amiable travelogue” by the “dishy documentarian” (two cheers for reverse sexism) who “examined giant redwoods and Beyoncé’s mansion”. What? Simon Reeve, as ever, made passionate points – about how planting and preserving trees, as President Franklin D Roosevelt did, might save the planet, and only gave us a flash of said mansion to make more poignant his plunging into the real hell of 45,000 people sleeping rough in Los Angeles. He also visited the gaunt ruins of the town of Paradise, which burned in seconds, as he warns more will probably do. He is often angry, always compassionate, not dismissive. Shoard says Glazer is an “uncompromisingly serious-minded film-maker”. So, actually, in a different way, is Simon Reeve.Alison SkilbeckLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
