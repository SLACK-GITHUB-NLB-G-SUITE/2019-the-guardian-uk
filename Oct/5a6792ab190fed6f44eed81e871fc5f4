Leyton Orient have postponed their Leasing.com Trophy match against Brighton Under-21s by 24 hours after suggestions that it might be attended by a large number of Ajax fans. Orient said in a statement that the match due to be played at their Breyer Group Stadium had been moved “following the advice of safety groups, including the police”. The match was due to take place on 5 November, the same night that Ajax are playing Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge. However Uefa has banned Ajax from selling tickets for that match as punishment for crowd trouble at their game against Valencia at the Mestalla this month. With up to 2,000 Ajax fans having already booked travel and accommodation, supporters’ groups had looked into the possibility of attending the Orient match instead. Last week Orient said they would be “entering in communication with AFC Ajax in how to best facilitate this”, but on Friday said the game had been moved.
