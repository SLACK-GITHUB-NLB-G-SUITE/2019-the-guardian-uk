Royal Mail workers have voted to strike over job insecurity and employment terms and conditions, raising fears there could be walkouts in the run-up to Christmas. Communication Workers Union (CWU) members backed industrial action by 97% in a turnout of almost 76%. The vote could potentially lead to the first national postal strike in a decade. The CWU said Royal Mail had not stuck to an agreement, which included plans to reduce the working week, reached last year. Terry Pullinger, the union’s deputy general secretary, said: “Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed.” We want to hear from postal workers who are in favour of industrial action about why they feel it could be necessary to do so.
