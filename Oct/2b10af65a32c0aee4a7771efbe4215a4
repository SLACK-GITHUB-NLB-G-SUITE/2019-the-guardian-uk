Bissell will not honour the lifetime guarantee for a carpet sweeper I bought from Argos because the receipt has faded so much it’s illegible. Argos just fobs me off.SC, Brighton Argos says: “We regularly review the services available in our stores to ensure we create the best possible experience for our customers. As part of this customers have the option of an e-receipt, printed receipt or both.” This is disingenuous. The company has known for years that its receipts, printed on thermal printers that don’t require expensive ink cartridges, fade within weeks when exposed to heat or light, even when stored in a box. Argos admitted the problem back in 2016 but has evidently done nothing to address it. Nor does it have to. Under UK law there is no obligation for retailers to provide a receipt, therefore there are no rules governing their quality. Luckily, contact from the Observer persuaded Bissell to send you a replacement sweeper, while Argos has provided an e-receipt and a gift card for the same value.
