“Not much support for Labour’s Brexit rebels” is the heading you gave to letters (24 October) mostly criticising Caroline Flint and others for voting for Johnson’s withdrawal bill and especially for its passage without delay. The implication is that these correspondents are satisfied, or much more satisfied, with Labour’s official position, assuming that they’ve been able to work out what it is. Following the defeat of the government’s programme motion, the Labour leadership rather unusually sent out Ian Lavery, party chair and committed leaver, to represent its position on the airwaves. Beyond continued resistance to no deal, he offered only the implausible idea of winning an election and renegotiating a more favourable deal with the EU – no mention of a referendum with the option to remain. According to Alan Marsden’s letter, “the inevitable consequence of how Flint et al voted is a Conservative government”. As the polls show, the same can be said of the official party line (for which ambiguity is too kind a word).Richard AllenCambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
