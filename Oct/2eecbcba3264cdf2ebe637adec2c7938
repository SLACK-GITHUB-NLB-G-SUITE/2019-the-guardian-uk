Barnsley have sacked manager Daniel Stendel, with the club currently 23rd in the Championship. Stendel, who led the Tykes to an impressive promotion from League One last season, leaves with the club second bottom in the second tier, having won one league game in 11. Adam Murray, the club’s under-18 head coach, steps in as caretaker. “Barnsley FC confirms that it has separated from Daniel Stendel with immediate effect,” read a club statement. “Adam Murray has been appointed caretaker manager.” Stendel took charge at Oakwell in June 2018 on a two-year contract and the former Hannover coach ensured an immediate return to the Championship, his team finishing runners-up to Luton. The club have struggled back at this level, however, winning just their opening match against Fulham and scoring a division-low eight goals. And the final straw proved to be Saturday’s 5-1 rout at Preston.
