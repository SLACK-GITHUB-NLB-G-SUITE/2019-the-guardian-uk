Police in Victoria will be able to use lethal force to stop vehicles being used as deadly weapons, in the wake of the Bourke Street rampage two years ago. The directive is contained in a new “hostile vehicle” policy reportedly outlined in an email sent to Victoria police officers. “The thrust is to give our members clarity,” the deputy commissioner Shane Patton said. “We know hostile vehicle incidents can escalate quickly and there is a very real threat that people can be killed or seriously injured.” Officers will undergo online and face-to-face training on the new policy, which outlines a range tactical responses to such emergencies, later this year. In January 2017 James Gargasoulas drove his car down Melbourne’s Bourke Street, killing six people and injuring 27.
