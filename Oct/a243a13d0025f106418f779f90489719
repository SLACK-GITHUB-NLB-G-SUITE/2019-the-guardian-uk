Matt Lucas and David Walliams are reuniting for a special episode of Little Britain called Little Brexit. The one-off episode will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4, where Little Britain started in 2000. The programme will catch up with many of Lucas’s and Walliams’s characters to see how one of the most contentious subjects in modern British history is affecting their lives. Characters that listeners will be hearing from include Dafydd, Vicky Pollard, Emily Howard, Marjorie Dawes, Mr Mann, and Lou and Andy. Original cast members Ruth Jones and Anthony Head will also be taking part, with narration by Tom Baker. #LittleBrexit >> coming 31 October 2019 >> https://t.co/2v2fprOuZx@RealMattLucas @davidwalliams @AshleyBlaker pic.twitter.com/jEHY0V7UxA Sioned Wiliam, commissioning editor for Radio 4 comedy, said: “Matt Lucas and David Walliams are uniquely talented writers and performers as well as one of the UK’s most loved comedy duos. It’s a privilege to have them back on Radio 4, where Little Britain first began almost 20 years ago.” Little Britain began as a radio show and moved to TV in 2003, running for three series. The Brexit-themed special will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 31 October.
