Lewis Hamilton has been scarred for life by racist abuse he suffered as a child, his Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has claimed.Hamilton, 34, could win his sixth world title on Sunday, taking him to within one of Michael Schumacher’s all-time tally. Hamilton broke down racial barriers as a junior kart racer en route to the top of F1, but he remains the sport’s only black driver and has called for greater diversity. “When Lewis was younger he was the only black kid among the white kids, and I know he was racially abused on the track,” Wolff said. “If that happens to an eight-year-old, or a 10-year-old, it just leaves scars that will not go away. If, as a child, you have had to overcome abuse and discrimination, on one side it makes you a stronger personality. But on the other side it also leaves scars. “Today Lewis has a good and mature perspective, but the scars are certainly there. That is not the only motivating factor for him – those scars are a witness of having survived. We have to acknowledge that we are not very diverse in Formula One, and I have certainly learned through Lewis to accept that it is difficult to overcome discrimination from time to time.”
