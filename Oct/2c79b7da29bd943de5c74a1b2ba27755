Tickets for the 50th year of Glastonbury have sold out in 34 minutes, as a record number of fans tried to secure a ticket for the event at Worthy Farm next June. Emily Eavis confirmed that a record number of people had registered to be eligible for the sale, which started at 9am on Sunday and was finished in little over 30 minutes. A record 2.4 million people signed up to have a chance of securing a ticket. “We have now sold out. Thank you all for your incredible, continued support,” she tweeted. “Demand was higher than ever … Bring on 2020!” We have now sold out. Thank you all for your incredible, continued support. Demand was higher than ever, with over 2.4 million people registered. Bring on 2020! https://t.co/a31IfvB4Vk The festival confirmed that 135,000 tickets had been sold, with coach packages selling out on Thursday in 27 minutes. The ticket sale was the second fastest in the event’s history, with only the 2014 festival selling out a few minutes more quickly. Glastonbury’s official Twitter account also confirmed the sellout and confirmed there would be a ticket resale in April – and “details of a special ballot for the sale of 50 pairs of tickets in the coming days”. No acts have been confirmed for Glastonbury 2020, but the bookmakers’ favourites are Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac and Paul McCartney. When asked about Fleetwood Mac as possible headliners during a Q&A at the 2019 festival, Michael Eavis said he was “hoping for Fleetwood Mac one day but when? We can’t afford them at the moment.” Mick Fleetwood fuelled speculation by telling a Wembley Stadium crowd in June that the band “still had a big field to play”. A resale for unwanted and unpaid coach packages is set for Thursday 16 April, followed by the ticket resale on Sunday 19 April, and Glastonbury 2020 will take place from 24 June to 28 June.
