In July I discovered I was the victim of identity fraud, and had to deal with several companies to resolve issues. They were all helpful, put fraud-prevention Cifas markers on my credit file and cancelled the accounts. Apart from Carphone Warehouse. Since the ID fraud, I’ve had repeated deliveries to my address of phones I have not ordered. I have reported this multiple times but the phones keep coming. Its fraud team investigated and concluded, in effect, it wasn’t its problem. Any fraudulent contracts set up in my name are cancelled, so I’m not sure why I’m still being sent phones. I am also checking my credit file daily and have not seen any new contracts sneak through. A note on my account warning staff not to approve orders to my address without extra checks has had no effect. At this point I’m not sure if continuing fraud is being committed or if it’s just a mix-up with different parts of the company. My own attempts to resolve this are going nowhere. KG, London The extraordinary aspect is that Carphone Warehouse was prepared to risk losing all the expensive handsets they bombarded you with rather than update their computer systems. For it seems it was ineptitude rather than skulduggery which caused the ongoing deliveries. It blames a “miscommunication” with its warehouse team which it says it is investigating. It would be fascinating to know how many phones you might have accumulated had media intervention not stemmed the flow. Carphone Warehouse says: “We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused. We fell short here and have offered the customer £100 in goodwill and can confirm that no more phones will be sent.” If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
