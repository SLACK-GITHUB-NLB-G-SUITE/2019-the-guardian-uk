Hoffenheim’s Sargis Adamyan scored his first two Bundesliga goals to stun hosts Bayern Munich 2-1 on Saturday and earn their first ever win in Munich. The 26-year-old Armenian striker scored either side of a Robert Lewandowski goal as Bayern crashed back down to reality four days after their 7-2 demolition of Tottenham in London in the Champions League. Bayern stayed top of the Bundesliga but are level on 14 points with Freiburg, who drew 2-2 with Borussia Dortmund, and RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen, who drew 1-1. The visitors had a golden chance after four minutes but Adamyan hesitated in his one-on-one with keeper Manuel Neuer to allow Jérôme Boateng to clear at the last moment. The Armenian made amends in the 54th when he fired in from a tight angle to surprise Neuer and grabbed his second in the 79th after Lewandowski had levelled with a 73rd-minute header. Borussia Dortmund twice squandered the lead and conceded a 90th-minute own goal from Manuel Akanji for their third consecutive league draw. Axel Witsel’s sensational volley from a corner put the visitors in the driving seat but Freiburg levelled through Luca Waldschmidt after a fine combination from the hosts. Dortmund, who also wasted leads in their previous two league game, thought they had done enough when Achraf Hakimi put them ahead again in the 67th. However, the own goal by Akanji, who flicked a cutback into his own net, forced them to settle for a draw and for seventh place on 12 points. • More to follow ...
