The front page of Spanish paper AS is entirely taken up by a large picture of Gareth Bale, and the words: Bale says, enough. Zinedine Zidane’s decision to leave him out of the matchday squad for the Champions League game at home to Club Brugge was, they report, “the straw that broke the camel’s back” (or “the drop that filled the glass”, as they say in Spain). 📰 La #PortadaAS del 8 de octubre de 2019 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 BALE DICE BASTA A post shared by  Diario AS (@diarioas) on Oct 7, 2019 at 3:01pm PDT In the summer, even when Zidane was publicly saying that he should leave, Bale’s preference was to stay and fight for his place. But that attitude, the paper continues, has now changed. “Bale has played well in recent weeks partly because he is angry,” AS write. “but he feels that he has played well, and does not deserve the treatment has is receiving. Leaving him out of the game against Brugge was difficult to understand, and has been the last straw. For the first time since he arrived in Madrid in 2013, the Welshman wants to leave.” What does Bale want? To leave Real Madrid! When does he want it? Er, not yet. AS specify on multiple occasions that he intends to depart next summer, so we face nine full months of wild speculation. Brace yourselves. Mauricio Pochettino is planning an extensive new year clear-out, claims the Times, as he attempts to repopulate the Tottenham squad with players who aren’t already bored of his coaching methods. Eric Dier, Christian Eriksen, Serge Aurier, Victor Wanyama and Danny Rose are all expendable, with the club having discovered since the season started the negative knock-on effect of these same players having been equally expendable in the summer without ever being expended. Spurs are also among the clubs being linked with Erling Braut Haaland, though they should brace themselves for a fight: Juventus, Manchester United and Liverpool are also keen on RB Salzburg’s 19-year-old Norwegian ace. United are apparently also monitoring Krylia Sovetov’s 22-year-old marksman Aleksandr Sobolev, a 6ft 4in sharp-shooter who has bagged 10 goals in 12 league games this season and was watched at the weekend by Arsenal (though this might have just been a motivational ruse). “In my opinion this is true,” he said of Arsenal’s reported interest. “I am not 100% sure, but this is what I was told.” Crystal Palace are preparing to re-swoop for last season’s loan hit Michy Batshuayi, having decided that a striker who has so far played just 44 minutes for Chelsea in Premier and Champions Leagues combined might be hustled out of the club in January. Though with Olivier Giroud also linked with a move away from the club in early 2020, it seems likely there will still be at least one unhappy substitute striker at Stamford Bridge for the remainder of the season. Finally in international transfer news Ike Ugbo, an England Under-17 and Under-20 international currently excelling at Dutch club Roda JC on loan from Chelsea, is wanted by Nigeria, and Italy want to claim Arsenal’s hitherto Brazilian forward Gabriel Martinelli.
