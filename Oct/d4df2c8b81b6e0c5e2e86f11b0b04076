A hearty, earthy negroni-with-a-twist that’s just the thing for an autumn evening. Cynar is one of Italy’s favourite bitter liqueurs – it’s main ingredient is artichoke, alongside a whole load of other plants and herbs – and it’s widely available here. There’s a bit of prep involved, but it’s not at all onerous. Serves 1 For the infusion1 globe artichoke, washed and trimmed200ml gin For the drink25ml artichoke-infused gin (see above and method)25ml sweet vermouth 20ml Campari 5ml Cynar Pull the leaves off the artichoke and cut out and clean the heart. Put the heart and leaves (save a few for garnish) in a non-reactive container into which they’ll fit snugly, then add the gin, cover and leave to infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Fine strain into a sterilised bottle and seal. The infusion will keep for for ages. To make the drink, put everything in a mixing glass or shaker, add a good handful of ice and stir for five to 10 seconds. Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice and garnish with a washed artichoke leaf. • Rik Patel, Gezellig, London WC1
