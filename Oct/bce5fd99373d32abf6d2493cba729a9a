Paul Pogba has been ruled out of Manchester United’s Premier League match against Liverpool, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær also expecting David de Gea to be unavailable. The absence of two key players for Sunday is a sizeable blow as the manager seeks to arrest a form slump in which United have not won in the league for more than a month. Pogba has not recovered from a foot injury while De Gea requires a scan after sustaining what appeared to be a groin problem in Spain’s Euro 2020 qualifier with Sweden on Tuesday. “David needs a scan,” Solskjær told Sky Sports. “I think he’ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it’s one of those things.” Of Pogba, the Norwegian said: “He had a scan after the Arsenal game [at the end of last month] and maybe needed a few weeks’ rest in a boot so hopefully he won’t be too long, but he won’t make this game, no.”Solskjær may also be without Jesse Lingard, while the availability of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Anthony Martial is in the balance. “Hopefully Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection. If it’s for half a game or 30 minutes I don’t know but let’s see where they’re at,” said Solskjær.
