Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels are close to agreeing a 12-year deal that would secure the outfielder the largest contract in the history of sports, according to multiple reports. The 27-year-old is due to become a free-agent in 2020 and several Major League Baseball clubs had already started showing an interest in the greatest player of his generation. However, the new deal would likely see Trout play the rest of his career with the club that drafted him in 2009. According to ESPN, the contract would earn Trout an average of $36m a year. The deal would top the $330m deal Bryce Harper signed with the Philadelphia Phillies last month, and the $365m boxer Canelo Álvarez agreed with broadcaster DAZN last year. Despite the seven-time All-Star’s immense talent – Trout is a two-time American League MVP and has hit 240 home runs in 1,065 games and, if anything, is getting better – he is a low-key figure and away from the field is mainly known for his interest in weather forecasting. The Angels have struggled to find success since Trout was elevated to the majors in 2011 and have only reached the playoffs once in the last nine seasons. They do, however, have a strong farm system and exciting players such as Shohei Ohtani, a rare player who is a threat as a pitcher and batter at the highest level.
