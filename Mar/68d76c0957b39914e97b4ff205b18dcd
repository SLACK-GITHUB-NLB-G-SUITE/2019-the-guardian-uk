Armed police evacuated Westminster Bridge and Victoria Embankment in central London on Saturday afternoon after a suspicious vehicle was found close to the Houses of Parliament. Footage from traffic cameras in the area showed a cordon set up on the bridge and police sealing off the entrance to Parliament Square and halfway along the Embankment. #CS3 and adjacent carriageway (A3211) closed along Victoria Embankment due to an incident. Westminster Bridge also closed to vehicles and pedestrians.

The Metropolitan police headquarters is also nearby.

Officers closed off the area at 15.15. They remain on the scene.” A controlled explosion was carried out on the vehicle at around 4.30pm, which officers at the scene said was a “precautionary” action. By 4.38pm the bridge had reopened, allowing crowds of tourists to return to the area. @BBCBreaking Westminster Bridge pic.twitter.com/2CtlhvX3KN
