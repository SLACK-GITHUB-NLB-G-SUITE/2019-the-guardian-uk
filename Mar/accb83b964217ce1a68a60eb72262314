Labor has pledged $1bn to upgrade public hospital facilities, promising more beds, emergency department upgrades and new palliative care and mental health facilities. Labor says it is partnering with state and territory governments to identify which hospital projects to support and promises the capital investments will come on top of its commitment to restore core public hospital funding. In a statement, Bill Shorten said Australia “should have a world-class health care system but some of our hospitals are suffering from neglect”. “Labor’s investment will upgrade hospitals, expanding capacity where it is needed and building new facilities where they are needed,” he said. “There’s nothing more important than your health – I want people to get the care they need as close as possible to their home.” Labor campaigned hard on the issue of health at the 2016 election, securing a swing with what Malcolm Turnbull called a dishonest campaign centred on the claim the Liberals would privatise Medicare. In the 2017 budget the Coalition unfroze indexation of Medicare rebates for GPs, although reintroduction of indexation for other items on the Medicare benefits schedule was phased in over two years. The 2018 budget shows that hospital funding is set to grow from $77.6bn in 2018 to $85bn in 2021-22, but Labor prefers to focus on $715m cut from the 2017 to 2020 funding agreement with the states. In December Morrison sought to ward off a renewed Labor attack on healthcare by offering a further $1.25bn over four years, although that falls short of the $2.8bn promised by Bill Shorten in his budget-in-reply in 2018. On Sunday the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced the Coalition would spend $200m to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for x-rays and ultrasounds. Under the plan, Medicare rebates for about 90% of diagnostic imaging services will increase regularly over three years from 1 July 2020 – for the first time in 20 years.
