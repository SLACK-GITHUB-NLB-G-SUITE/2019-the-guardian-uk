The Democratic rising star Beto O’Rourke is jumping into the race for president, he told a Texas TV station in a text message Wednesday. The Democrat, who has publicly mulled a run for months, confirmed his plans in a text to KTSM of El Paso, where he served as a US representative. O’Rourke said he was proud of “what El Paso represents”, calling it “a big part of why I’m running. This city is the best example of this country at its best.” The former congressman gained a national following with his run for Senate last year against Republican Ted Cruz. Though he lost, the close result was considered impressive for a Texas Democrat. He plans to formally announce his campaign for the presidential nomination Thursday, according to KTSM. A source told Reuters the announcement would come via social media. O’Rourke inched closer to a run in a Vanity Fair cover story released earlier Wednesday. “You can probably tell that I want to run,” he said. “I do. I think I’d be good at it. “Man, I’m just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment,” O’Rourke said. He plans to head to Iowa for a three-day trip starting Thursday, the Dallas Morning News reported, and his supporters were receiving emails asking for help sending out text messages Thursday morning.
