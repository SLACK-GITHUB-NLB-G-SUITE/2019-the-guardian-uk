A Manchester United fan is being treated in hospital in France for a stabbing injury shortly after the English side knocked Paris Saint-Germain out of the Champions League on Wednesday evening. The Foreign Office said it was in touch with the French authorities over the incident, with reports suggesting the man is undergoing emergency surgery. “We are in touch with the French authorities following an incident involving a British man in Paris on 6 March and stand ready to offer assistance if required,” a spokesman said on Thursday evening. It is understood that the 44-year-old man was taken to the high dependency unit at the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, a little less than a mile away and on the opposite side of the river from the Parc des Princes, where the match was played. He is thought to have undergone an operation there to remove blood on his lung. According to Sky Sports News, he was stabbed in the chest by a taxi driver who became angry at his and his friends’ post-match celebrations. The group of four was reportedly travelling back to central Paris from Parc de Princes, in the west of the city, when the taxi driver ordered them to leave the vehicle. The broadcaster reported that the taxi driver pulled out a knife and threatened a female member of the group. When the victim tried to intervene, it said, he was stabbed in the chest with a “large blade”. Sky Sports News said  French police arrested an unnamed suspect on Thursday, but the weapon is yet to be found. Local police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
