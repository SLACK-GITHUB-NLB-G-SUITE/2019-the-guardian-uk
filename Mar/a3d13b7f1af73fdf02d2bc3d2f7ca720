For many people, the word karaoke evokes foggy, unpleasant memories of Wonderwall at the office Christmas party. But the activity has undergone a revival recently. Karaoke nights have sprung up around the UK to accommodate the demand, while Lucky Voice, a nationwide chain, reported that December was its busiest month on record. Iain Irving founded Supercube, a karaoke-booth venue, in Edinburgh in 2010. Thanks to the surge in popularity, he opened an outpost in Glasgow in November and has plans for a second in Edinburgh this year. Irving says the slightly sad local-pub karaoke we may recall with a cringe is not real karaoke. “It would be almost like an ordeal people had to go through, about embarrassment and getting shamed in front of your friends. It wasn’t about what it’s supposed to be about, which is enjoying music.” According to Lucky Voice, Britain’s favourite genre is musicals; Let It Go from Frozen is the chain’s most-requested song. And letting go is exactly what karaoke is all about. At the London event Gospeloke, singers take to the stage backed by a 10- to 15-piece gospel choir. “When you sing, it does make you feel good, ultimately,” says the founder, who calls himself Johnny Unknown. “We’ve had people leave going: ‘I feel I’ve been spiritually healed.’” Singing is known to be cathartic, as well as bonding. “Social media can separate us a bit, but karaoke is very communal,” says Rob Pursey, the founder of – and DJ at – Hip Hop Karaoke. “I think people look for that and they get addicted to that feeling of euphoria. “I think everyone is bogged down in having political debates all day on Facebook and Twitter, so it’s nice to come out to a venue and rap your favourite Dr Dre lyrics to a cheering crowd.” With Brexit dominating the headlines, we are all craving escape – and karaoke provides it, says Irving: “You just feel like you’re on a different planet for a couple of hours.”
