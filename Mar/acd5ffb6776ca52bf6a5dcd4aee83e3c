India’s national carrier has reminded its cabin crew to end announcements with a rousing “Jai Hind”, meaning hail India, as part of an upswell of patriotism in the wake of recent armed clashes with Pakistan. “With immediate effect, all are required to announce ‘Jai Hind’ at the end of every announcement after a slight pause and with much fervour,” Air India’s head of operations said in a memo this week. A spokesman for the airline told Agence France-Presse the order was first issued in 2017 but had been recirculated for new staff. India and Pakistan have been engaged in a tense standoff for nearly three weeks since a Pakistan-based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in a car bombing in disputed Kashmir. The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since India and Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the 'line of control' based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east. India and Pakistan have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged. After the partition of colonial India 71 years ago, small, semi-autonomous 'princely states' across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join,  until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad. Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control. In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join, or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held. In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections, and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders. There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerillas fought a war replete with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing. Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with extreme force in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters. For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi Nationalist sentiment has surged on both sides as the Indian and Pakistani air forces have engaged in tit-for-tat airstrikes and, last week, after Pakistan returned an Indian pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, whose plane it shot down. Varthaman has become a hero, with some copying his trademark handlebar moustache and one couple naming their child after him. People have flocked to the cinemas to watch Uri, a Bollywood blockbuster about a military operation India says it conducted against militants in 2016 – the last time a militant attack triggered an armed Indian response. Its catchphrase “How’s the josh” – meaning how’s the patriotic morale – has been adopted by politicians at rallies ahead of the country’s general elections starting in April. After the 2016 clash, India’s supreme court ordered that every cinema screening should be preceded by the national anthem, with all patrons required to stand. The order led to scuffles breaking out in cinemas and assaults on one patron in Goa state who did not stand – who later turned out to be a wheelchair user. Journalists who have questioned India’s official narrative of its strikes against Pakistan have found themselves sharply criticised by the government. At the weekend, the news anchor Rahul Kanwal was told by the government minister Piyush Goyal that he was “belittling our armed forces” and bringing shame on himself for asking about discrepancies in the country’s version of events. Air India’s announcement on Tuesday also attracted mockery on social media in view of the stricken airline’s crippling debts. A Twitter user, Dinesh Joshi, wrote: “Much welcome but before starting this Air India should improve the service. Make the airline profitable. Keep up to schedule. Stop wasting taxpayer money. Be customer friendly.” Harsh Goenka, a businessman, tweeted: “Now with this new move, I’m sure Air India will soon become profitable. Jai Hind!” Others pointed out that passengers may be in for a surprise if low-key in-flight announcements were followed by a “Jai Hind”: With much fervour🤣"The captain would like to announce some Turbulence coming your way... Jai Hind"Sums up the country I think https://t.co/EIvXfPDB2q Agence France-Presse contributed to this report
