The Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage has officially filed an annulment from his wife of four days. Cage and makeup artist Erika Koike applied for a wedding license on 23 March and were wed the very same day in Las Vegas, Nevada. By Wednesday, the actor applied for an annulment. This is his shortest marriage yet, topping his 2002 marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, which lasted 108 days before they split. According to TMZ, hours after their wedding, the pair were spotted arguing at the Las Vegas hotel Bellagio. Witnesses and photos show Koike yelling at the 55-year-old actor. Not much is known publicly about his now estranged wife, except that Koike was also previously married. The couple began dating in April 2018. Cage was also previously married to Patricia Arquette, from 1995 to 2001, and Alice Kim, from 2004 to 2016. He has two sons, 28-year-old Weston Coppola Cage, whose mother is Cage’s former long-term partner Christina Fulton, and Kal-El, whose mother is Kim. The nephew of the famed director Francis Ford Coppola, Cage has starred in many Hollywood blockbusters, such as Moonstruck, National Treasure and the critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the 2019 Oscar winner for best animated feature. For comparison’s sake, this marriage was 18 times shorter than Kim Kardashian West’s marriage to her second husband, Kris Humphries.
