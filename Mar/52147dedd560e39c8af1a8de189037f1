Jos Buttler’s controversial dismissal overshadowed Kings XI Punjab’s 14-run victory over the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. The England batsman was run out backing up at the non-striker’s end by Ravichandran Ashwin after an impressive 69 during a match in Mohali that also marked the return of Steve Smith. The former Australia captain was dismissed for 20 by England’s Sam Curran on his IPL return and his wicket began a collapse of seven for 16 as the Royals, chasing 184, fell 14 runs short. Buttler had registered his sixth half-century for the Royals as they chased the Kings’ total. The 28-year-old had reached 69 off 43 balls when he was “mankaded” by Ashwin. With Buttler at the non-striker’s end and marginally out of his crease Ashwin, the Kings captain who had run in to bowl, stopped and whipped off the bails. It was a legal dismissal but one seen by many as going against the “spirit of the game”. Ashwin Mankads ButtlerWithin the rules of the game? Fair play? Would you have done it?

He was clearly furious as he walked back to the pavilion while players, pundits and viewers waded in on social media. The England one-day captain, Eoin Morgan, wrote on Twitter: “I can’t believe what I’m seeing!! IPL Terrible example to set for young kids coming through. In time I think Ashwin will regret that.” “That is terrible,” said the England batsman Sam Billings, who added: “Well the fair play award isn’t going to Mohali this year…” The former England captain Michael Vaughan said Ashwin’s actions were unacceptable and called for a change in the laws of the game. Ashwin defended his actions after the match, telling Star Gold: “It was pretty instinctive. I actually didn’t even load. He left the crease, that’s it. That’s always been my take on it because that’s my half of the crease.” Before Buttler’s dismissal, the game was more notable for the return of Smith following his ban. He looked understandably rusty at the start of his innings but improved to reach 20 off 16 balls before being dismissed. Chris Gayle hit 79 from 47 balls for Kings before he was caught off the England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who took two for 48.
