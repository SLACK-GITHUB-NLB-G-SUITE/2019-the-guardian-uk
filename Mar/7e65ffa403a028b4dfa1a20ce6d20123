Some unlikely protesters have been gracing the confirmation hearings of nominees for top government posts during Donald Trump’s time in office. This week, the Senate energy and natural resources committee held a confirmation hearing for David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who has been serving as the acting interior secretary since the resignation of Ryan Zinke in January. And as the committee pressed him on his lobbying record Thursday, a protester in the gallery highlighted the contradiction inherent in his nomination by dawning a swamp creature mask.

The sight of such a horrific swamp creature in the Senate, at least of the fantastical kind, isn’t an every day occurrence, but it’s the latest example of what has become a trend of late: satirical protest through the placement of humorously absurd characters in the background of hearings. The @SecretaryRoss hearing just started. We got in! 😬 #LetThemEatCake pic.twitter.com/bx8TqtQDzx Earlier this month a protester dressed as Marie Antoinette glanced over the shoulder of the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. The group American Family Voices, like many others, took umbrage with comments Ross and others in the administration had made during the government shutdown that seemed to echo Antoinette’s infamous dismissal of the living conditions of average people. Is climate change “make believe” just like this unicorn in the audience? It is not. pic.twitter.com/EYU474c22x It’s a tactic that has since migrated into state legislative hearings more recently as well. This week activists from the group the Better Path Coalition sat in on a hearing in the Pennsylvania house to protest climate-change denying state lawmakers. “We’re myths. Climate change isn’t,” they explained.

In April of last year they returned, this time as a “Russian troll” complete with bright blue troll wig during an appearance by the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in front of the commerce and judiciary committees. “I think one reason I’ve taken the approach of kind of making a spectacle of myself is to actually steal away the spotlight from these lawmakers who want to grandstand in these hearings, and then not pass any meaningful legislation,” Madrigal has said. “So hopefully by stealing their spotlight, I’m putting more pressure on them from their constituents to actually do their jobs.”
