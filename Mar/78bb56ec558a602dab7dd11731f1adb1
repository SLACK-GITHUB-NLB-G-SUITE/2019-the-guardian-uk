Shamima Begum and her newborn baby have been moved from a Syrian refugee camp after threats were made against them, according to her family’s lawyer. The 19-year-old and her son were moved from the Al-Hol camp in the north of the country due to “safety concerns around her and her baby”, Tasnime Akunjee said. Last week, Begum, who left the UK in 2015 with two school friends, said she wanted to return home for the health of her then-unborn child. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has ordered that the British-born woman’s citizenship be revoked. Begum, who gave birth days after her discovery by a journalist was first reported, said she wished she had kept a low profile. On Friday, the Sun reported that Begum had received death threats since speaking out about her plight. The mother and her baby are said to have since been moved to another camp nearer to the Iraqi border. Akunjee told the paper: “I can confirm that it is our understanding that Shamima has been moved from Al-Hol due to safety concerns around her and her baby. We further understand that indeed she and her child had been threatened by others at the Al-Hol camp.” British officials have ruled out any effort inside Syria to extract Begum and her child. Her family have pleaded for the mother and child to be allowed to come back to Britain. They say the teenager should face justice if she is found to have broken the law by travelling to Syria. Earlier this week, a shooting range in the Wirral in north-west England defended its use of Begum’s image as a target, saying it had received a large number of requests from customers.
