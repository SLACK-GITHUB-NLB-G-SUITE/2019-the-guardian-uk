Gianluigi BuffonThe Italian allowed Lukaku’s second goal and should he have been quicker out to before the first? 4 Thilo KehrerBackpass allowed Lukaku’s early strike; always less assured than his defensive colleagues. 4 Thiago SilvaCalmest in a shaky back four when United attacked. Also found Alves with precise diagonals. 6 Presnel KimpembeStood up to Lukaku’s threat at times but gave away what proved the crucial Rashford penalty. 5Juan BernatDrove along the left constantly; slid home to level on the night and might have had a second. 7 Dani AlvesRattled by an early Pereira challenge but his pass slipped in Mbappé before Bernat’s equaliser and was inventive. 7 Marco VerrattiNot quite the force he was in the opening leg, the Italian nearly scored an own goal. 7 MarquinhosWas part of a PSG midfield that, like its United counterpart, did not protect the defence enough. 6 Julian DraxlerDropped deep but influence was sporadic due to PSG often targeting the flanks. Taken off. 5 Kylian MbappéA constant outlet, creating PSG’s opener yet while he punched holes in visitors he did fluff chances. 7 Ángel Di MaríaSharp link-up play but not as bright as he was in the first leg. Goal was (correctly) adjudged offside. 6 Subs Leandro Paredes (for Kehrer, 70) 5; Thomas Meunier (for Draxler, 70) 6; Edinson Cavani (for Alves, 90) 6. David de GeaCould do little to prevent Bernat’s goal but saved what looked a certain second. 7 Victor LindelöfSwede was part of United rearguard given the runaround but improved after the break. 7 Chris SmallingSenior defender struggled to organise but he made one superb challenge on quicksilver Mbappé. 7 Eric BaillyRight-back was terrorised by Bernat before limping off on 35 minutes – surely to United fans’ relief. 5 Ashley YoungDozing when Bernat ran inside to create a chance for Mbappé but settled and made a crucial clearance. 7 Scott McTominayStruggled at first to protect the defence but he had a fine second half of thwarting No 6 play. 7 FredLooked to get among PSG and the senior midfielder in the XI became better and better. 7 Andreas PereiraMisplaced touches and passes evident, but showed flashes of invention before being replaced. 5 Luke ShawBegan tentatively but composure tightened his contribution; he ended as United’s best defender. 7 Marcus RashfordNerves of steel to score the winner. Press on Kehrer created the error that led to the opener and snap-shot at Buffon presaged Lukaku’s second. 9 Romelu LukakuImpressive dream start with a super solo effort became even better when he slotted a second. 8 Subs Diogo Dalot (for Bailly, 36) 7; Tahith Chong (for Pereira, 80) 7; Mason Greenwood (for Young, 87) 7.
