1) Will Warren Gatland end his Six Nations sojourn with Wales as he began it, with a grand slam? Ireland stand in their way on Saturday, as they did when they visited Cardiff in 2005, when Wales memorably clinched a first title for 12 years. The whole game is here, if you’ve got the time. Wales beat Ireland at the 2011 World Cup too, but Ireland came out on top in 2018, en route to their own slam – and what a classic it was. Should Ireland prevail again this year it would pave the way for England to take the title by beating Scotland, something they achieved when they won the concluding matches in 1980 and at Twickenham in 1995. 2) Best you go your way and I’ll go mine: racing goes seriously freeform with horses peeling off in all directions at this race in France. 3) Ronnie O’Sullivan racked up his 1,000th century break en route to retaining the Players Championship last weekend. Here’s how he did it. While we’re at it, let’s turn the clock back to 1997, and his world-record fastest 147 at the world championships, and here’s a general Ronnie showreel to revel in. 4) He’s behind you! Carlisle’s Hallam Hope scored a cheeky goal against Notts County on Tuesday, hiding in the goalmouth before nipping in to pinch possession from the visiting keeper, Ryan Schofield, and score. It stirred memories of Gary Crosby’s effort for Nottingham Forest against Manchester City in 1990 and Dion Dublin embarrassing Shay Given in 1997. 5) When goal celebrations go wrong. That may bring back memories for FC Zurich fans after this 2016 crowd-surfing attempt failed spectacularly Lips don’t lie: some accent-specific choice words from Jack Grealish and this sweary Northern Irish referee here. 6) Swansea’s Bersant Celina had a cunning plan, alas it resulted in him taking one of the worst penalties of the decade on Wednesday night. At least Alexandre Pato propelled his shot forward. David Beckham got far more distance on his spot-kick when he slipped back in 2003. ❌PENALTY MISS!🙊Bersant Celina fluffs his lines in spectacular style. pic.twitter.com/fkXSRrJhJ4 1) It don’t mean a thing if you ain’t got that swing: a selection of somewhat inelegant golf drives. 2) Ajax hyping themselves up before conquering the Bernabéu, and a Jari Litmanen highlights package. 3) Memories of England-Italy “ruckgate” from two years ago, with a word from the ref. 4) A tribute to the NHL great Ted Lindsay, a four-time Stanley Cup winner, who died last week aged 93.
