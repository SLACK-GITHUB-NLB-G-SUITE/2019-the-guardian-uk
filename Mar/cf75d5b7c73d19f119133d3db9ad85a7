The repercussions of the Mueller report continued to cascade through news shows on Tuesday. While Democrats view Barr’s summary as just the first step in examining Mueller’s findings, “as far Trump is concerned, this ends the saddest chapter in American history”, reported Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “By the way, have you ever noticed that Trump is terrible at comforting victims unless it’s him?” Noah added. Trump tosses a roll of paper towels at a Hurricane Maria victim in Puerto Rico, “but with him, it’s like ‘the Mueller investigation was a terrible thing,’” Noah reassured in the president’s voice. “We’re going to do everything we can to get me back on my feet.” Fox News declares war on all the conspiracy theorists, propagandists, and liars 🤔🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/7TUv36UGrq The president received support from his usual backers. On Fox News, Tucker Carlson demanded punishment for those responsible for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, Laura Ingraham called for the exposure of people whose “fanatical hatred” for Trump threatened the country, and Sean Hannity promised to hold accountable all conspiracy theorists, propagandists and liars. Pump the brakes, Noah told Hannity. “If you got rid of all the conspiracy theorists, propagandists and liars, Fox News would just be a bunch of empty couches and a sexual harassment settlement.” Noah conceded that many people were wrong about Trump’s collusion allegations, but Fox News personalities “don’t get to say shit about conspiracy theories and political lies”. He rehashed some of their most egregious cases of fear-mongering: Ingraham’s website published stories that the Clintons murdered people, Carlson pushed the Obamacare death panels lie, and Hannity was “the worst of them all” for peddling the Seth Rich murder conspiracy. “So forget glass houses,” Noah concluded. “These people [are] in glass mansions with stone-powered AR-15s.” “Trump’s been on his own high ever since we got the Barr report of the Mueller report that said there’s nothing to report,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. Which means that coverage of the investigation’s findings has been like “a weird game of telephone where you don’t know what the first guy said but the last guy stabs you in the ear”. Nevertheless, Trump has gloated in the non-findings presented in Barr’s summary, taking what many media outlets have called a “victory lap” or, in Colbert’s estimation, a “winning shamble”. “And I’ve got to say that being told that you’ve not been indicted for betraying your country is a pretty low bar for a victory lap,” he added. Colbert turned to the victory lap’s Exhibit A: a memo circulated by the White House that warned television producers against booking critics of the president. Barr may have cleared Trump of collusion charges, Colbert said, but “that’s ignoring that those people thought Trump was guilty because he acted super guilty. I mean, if it looks like a duck, and swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then how are they supposed to know that it’s just a deeply strange squirrel who strapped on a beak and some wings and went ‘Quack, quack, what makes you think I’m a duck, you traitor?’” The memo also urged cable TV producers to ask, when booking a commentator, “Does this guest warrant further appearances in our programming, given the outrageous and unsupported claims made in the past?” Colbert saw some merit in this question. “Yes, I think cable news should ban appearances by everyone who’s ever made an outrageous or unsupported claim. Mr President, you will be missed.” Over in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also looked into the Trump TV memo. A “Do Not Book” list to cable news producers is “such a Trumpy thing to do”, he said. “[Trump] thinks the worst thing you could do to someone is to keep them off television.” Kimmel was particularly miffed about the concern for “outrageous and unsupported” claims. “Outrageous and unsupported’ – this is from the people who insisted that this crowd was bigger than this crowd,” he said to a side-by-side comparison of Trump’s inauguration crowd to Obama’s visibly larger one. In other White House gloating news, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted out a “Mueller Madness” bracket on Tuesday, which pitted vocal critics of the president (including #3 seed Colbert) against each other, NCAA college basketball-style, for the title of most embarrassing. “Poor Sarah Sanders,” Kimmel remarked. “She has to constantly defend nonsense and now she’s finally got a chance to fire back and this is how she does it, with a wacky Mueller Madness bracket. As the president would say, Sad!” One Trump figure not on the media offensive? Vice-president Mike Pence, who instead gave a speech advocating for the proposed Space Force military branch. Poor Mike Pence – he probably thought he’d be president by now,” Kimmel observed. “Instead he’s arranging our meeting with Jesus on the moon.”
