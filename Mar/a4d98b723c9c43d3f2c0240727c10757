A gender-switched revival of a Stephen Sondheim classic and a feelgood 9/11 musical head the nominations for the UK’s most prestigious theatre awards. The musicals Company and Come from Away each received nine nominations for the 2019 Olivier awards, to be presented at the Royal Albert Hall on 7 April. They were closely followed by The Inheritance, a sprawling two-part, seven-hour play about the lives of gay men in New York that began at the Young Vic before a West End transfer. It received eight nominations. It was also a strikingly good year for the National Theatre in the nominations, announced online by the actors Sheila Atim and Giles Terera. It had four productions – The Lehman Trilogy, Home, I’m Darling, Nine Night, and Antony and Cleopatra – up for prizes. Big names in the acting categories include Gillian Anderson, David Suchet, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Sir Ian McKellen, who could add to his record five Olivier acting awards. Julian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre, which organises the awards, said the April ceremony, hosted by comedian Jason Manford, would be a celebration of incredible creative talent. “This year’s nominations really highlight the sheer breadth and diversity of the modern British theatre landscape, with an exciting mix of well-established and new voices.” The reboot of Company, first performed in 1970, is interesting because it swaps the gender of the main character, originally a 35-year-old single man who sleeps around unable to commit. Bobby has become Bobbie, played by Rosalie Craig, who is nominated for best actress in a musical. Up against her, in a particularly strong category, are Sharon D Clarke for Caroline, Or Change; Kelli O’Hara for The King and I; and Adrienne Warren for her portrayal of Tina Turner in Tina, a role she will this year reprise on Broadway. In total four performers from Company are nominated, including the Broadway musical legend Patti LuPone; and Jonathan Bailey and Richard Fleeshman. The show’s director, Marianne Elliott, picks up the fourth best director nomination of her career. She will be up against Sam Mendes, Rebecca Frecknall, Stephen Daldry and Christopher Ashley. Ashley is the director of Come From Away, which tells the true story of the kindness and good nature of people in the small Newfoundland community of Gander when 38 passenger planes and 7,000 confused, bewildered passengers ended up there because of the attacks in the US. It was first workshopped and performed in Oakville, Ontario before becoming a phenomenon that opened on Broadway in 2017 and London last month. Its nine nominations include best new musical, competing against Tina, Fun Home and Six. Sophie Okonedo will be a favourite to follow up her Evening Standard best actress award with an Olivier for Antony and Cleopatra. She goes up against Gillian Anderson, Eileen Atkins, Patsy Ferran and Katherine Parkinson. McKellen could add to his record haul of Oliviers with another for King Lear, which began at Chichester before its West End transfer. Also nominated are David Suchet, Kyle Soller, Arinzé Kene and three actors jointly nominated for The Lehman Brothers: Adam Godley, Ben Miles and Simon Russell Beale. In opera, it is a strong year for English National Opera with War Requiem, Porgy and Bess and Paul Bunyan all in the outstanding achievement category.
