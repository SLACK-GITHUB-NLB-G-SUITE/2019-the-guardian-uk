The illusionist Uri Geller has called on the British people to help him in his efforts to telepathically stop Brexit by sending their own telepathic messages to Theresa May’s mind, compelling her to revoke article 50. Geller wrote an open letter to the prime minister on Friday warning her he will use the powers of his mind to stop her from leading Britain into Brexit. He plans to transmit his psychic energy into May’s brain at the “very mystical time” of 11.11 in the morning and evening every day from a secret location near his home in Israel. He will visualise her signing a document revoking article 50 and, separately, he will also visualise her deciding to hold a second referendum – but this, he says, is his “second choice”. “I urge and plea with the people to think – even if it’s for a few seconds – at 11.11am and 11.11pm, to send Theresa May that message to revoke article 50 and remain in the EU,” he said. “Energy can be transmitted, energy can be received and the collective energy of people who want to achieve something is massive.” He has no problem with the ethics of his decision. “I don’t see this as interfering with [May’s] mind. I’m giving her a scenario to understand better the situation. I’m opening up her mind to listen to messages from the people. “As far as I’m concerned, if we leave the EU, that is going to be a catastrophic event,” the psychic warned. He has already successfully penetrated May’s mind, he added, when she visited his home three years before she became prime minister. “I bombarded her mind to be the prime minister – and she became the prime minister,” he said.
