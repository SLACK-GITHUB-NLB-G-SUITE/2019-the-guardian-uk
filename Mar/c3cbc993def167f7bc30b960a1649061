On Friday 8 March millions of people will be taking part in events to mark International Women’s Day. Last year strikes, protests and parties were held around the world, paying tribute to women’s achievements and the ongoing fight for equality. This year’s theme is #BalanceforBetter, a call to action for accelerating gender balance in business, politics, media coverage and wealth. If you are planning on joining an event this year or marking the day in your own way, we’d like to hear from you. In 2018 many gathered under the banner of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. We’d like to know whether you think these campaigns are still as powerful one year on. What are the next steps and challenges to keep the spotlight on the progress and failings in achieving gender equality? Has #MeToo affected you personally? Tell us your story in the form below including where in the world you are and what has moved you to participate – we’ll feature some of your contributions as part of our coverage. Many events will be held on the days preceding 8 March and we’d also like to hear about them. We are also interested in receiving your views in video form for a story we plan to run on our Instagram account. If you’re interested in taking part, you can email instagramstories@theguardian.com or get in touch via WhatsApp by adding the contact +44(0)7495 849246 and we’ll send you more details.
