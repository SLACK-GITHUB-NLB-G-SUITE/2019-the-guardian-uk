Counter-terrorism police have raided two homes on the New South Wales mid-north coast, including the residence of the sister of the Australian suspect in the Christchurch terrorist attack, as part an investigation into last Friday’s mosque shootings. Officers from the NSW joint counter-terrorism team searched a property in Sandy Beach, near Coffs Harbour, about 8.30am on Monday and then targeted a second property at Lawrence, near Maclean. “The primary aim of the activity is to formally obtain material that may assist New Zealand police in their ongoing investigation,” the Australian federal police and NSW police said in a joint statement. “The family of the Australian man arrested in Christchurch continues to assist police with their inquiries.” Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, has been charged with murder over the massacre of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday and faced the Christchurch district court over the weekend.Police said there was no information to suggest a current or impending threat connected to the raids. Tarrant grew up in Grafton in NSW, and had returned to the town for his sister’s birthday about a year ago. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day.
