The curtain has finally fallen on Tim Cahill’s long football career with the 39-year-old confirming he will not seek another playing contract. Cahill, who is the Socceroos’ all-time top scorer, announced his retirement from international football following last year’s World Cup, before making one final appearance off the bench in a friendly against Lebanon in his home town of Sydney in November. He continued playing at club level, for Jamshedpur in the Indian Super League, but has now called time on his playing career at all levels and will instead focus on getting his coaching badges and other interests. “No, I’m an old man now in football years,” Cahill told Optus Sport when asked if he would play on. “I’d love to keep playing, you know 39, had a great stint for six months in India. “But I’m interested in TV, going to start my A licence and spend quality time with my family and chill out for a bit.” At club level, Cahill played for Millwall, Everton, New York Red Bulls, Shanghai Shenhua, Zhejiang Greentown and Melbourne City before playing one season in India. In his eight years at Everton he scored 56 goals across 226 appearances, and was named the club’s player of the season for 2004–05. “It was amazing to play in four big continents. I had a great career and I’m really thankful,” Cahill said. “I’m someone that massively respects the game and I’ll take my time to learn more. Coaching is something that’s definitely going to be on the horizon.” Cahill, who is widely considered one of the greatest Socceroos of all time, made 107 international appearances and scored 50 goals across a record-breaking career. He is the only Australian to have played at four World Cups and retired as Australia’s record World Cup and Asian Cup goalscorer.
