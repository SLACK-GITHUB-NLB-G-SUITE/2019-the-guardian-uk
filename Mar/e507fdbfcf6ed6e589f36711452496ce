Senator Cory Booker’s sleep/coffee joke is a thing of strange beauty. The first time you hear it – the first time you read “‘Sleep’ and I broke up a few nights ago. I’m dating ‘Coffee’ now. She’s Hot!” on Booker’s Twitter feed – it barely provokes a reaction. But then he tweets it again. And again. And again. The joke starts to irritate you. Why is he doing this? Is it the only joke he knows? But he persists. On and on, tweeting the joke over and over, until something permanently breaks in your mind. Suddenly it is hilarious; it’s the funniest thing you’ve ever heard. It’s the Sideshow Bob rake principle writ large. You’re going to vote for Cory Booker. You know you are. Yes, it is a terrible joke, but that’s what makes it so perfect. You don’t want a funny president. Nobody wants a funny president. Being funny takes up valuable brain space, and president of the US is a job that cannot spare any brain space. Cory Booker always tells the same joke for the same reason that Barack Obama always wore the same outfit; it’s one less decision for him to make. Plus, it’s relatable. What if the coffee joke actually functioned as a joke? What if it was clever, and smart, and provoked an involuntary belly laugh? You would hate him for it. The fact that it doesn’t work is entirely in his favour. We’ve all told jokes that have bombed. We’ve all overshot a moment of vulnerability like that. When we look at Cory Booker, drenched in flop sweat and knowing that he’s just fired off an absolute stinker, we can all see ourselves. His bad joke makes him the underdog, just like you. If only Hillary Clinton had repeatedly told one terrible joke, rather than hiring an intern to tweet an interminable torrent of focus-grouped memes, the world might just be a better place right now. So Cory Booker’s joke is a bad one. But let’s all relax. By the time he finishes his term as president in 2028, you’ll have heard it a trillion times, and you’ll be wetting yourself.
