I find reading about rich people very depressing. Not because I am jealous they have so much money, but because I am frustrated they have so little imagination. Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home-buyers are “choosing to live in corporate-branded communities”. Not just any branded communities, mind you, but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche, Armani and Bulgari. These expensive branded buildings have proliferated in the past few years, a trend that seems to be driven by the 1% having more money than they know what to do with. Slapping a fancy brand name on a residential development can add a price premium of 14% to 44%, according to the upmarket estate agency Savills. A report on the sector by another agency, Knight Frank, notes that there is a “direct correlation between wealth creation and demand for branded residences”. While the market is dominated by hotel groups such as Four Seasons, other brands are muscling in. In 2017, the Porsche Design Tower opened in Miami; residents of the skyscraper can drive their car straight into their multimillion-dollar apartment. The city, which seems to be the spiritual home of the unimaginably and unimaginatively wealthy, also hosts the Fendi Château and the Armani Residences. If you are feeling impecunious and excluded, you will be cheered to learn that corporate communities are coming to the masses. Airbnb has started to design and build houses, while Facebook and Google have announced plans to build affordable housing units. Soon we will all live in Facebook flats, commute to WeWorks in an Uber and buy everything from Amazon – one big corporate community.
