Friday 29 March marks five years since the first same-sex weddings in the UK. A cause for genuine celebration, it also serves as reminder of the continuing exclusion of the LGBT community in Northern Ireland. With Northern Ireland left out of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act, and with Scotland and the Republic of Ireland having both since legalised same-sex unions, Northern Ireland has been left well and truly behind. Northern Ireland’s same-sex couples are being denied the simple right to marry, despite overwhelming support among the public as well as the backing of at least 55 of the 90 assembly members. However, as we all know, Stormont has not met in more than two years and with no immediate prospect of its return the only government and only legislature able to address this issue is to be found at Westminster. The government must act. It should extend legislation in England and Wales to couples in Northern Ireland. In due course, Stormont can legislate on the matter if it so chooses when it finally returns. Our union should be built on common values, equality and rights, with no one left behind. Let’s have a wedding anniversary that all can celebrate.Conor McGinn MP LabourRobert Hayward Conservative, House of Lords • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
