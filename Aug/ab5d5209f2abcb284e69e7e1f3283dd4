World Cup champion Carli Lloyd showed off her leg during a visit to Philadelphia Eagles training camp on Tuesday, drilling a series of long field goals that caught the attention of at least one renowned NFL scout who said that she deserves an “honest tryout” with any team in search of a place-kicker. Lloyd, a south New Jersey native and longtime Eagles fan, connected on several 40-yard attempts with room to spare before hitting from 55 yards after a joint practice between the Eagles and Baltimore Ravens in south Philadelphia, the team said. Afterward the 37-year-old forward for the NWSL’s Sky Blue FC posted video of the session, saying, “I’m really impressed with all these guys. It’s awesome to be here. Really looking forward to the season.” The footage caught the attention of retired Dallas Cowboys talent evaluator Gil Brandt, who said an NFL team in need of a kicker, such as the Chicago Bears, should give Lloyd a look. “Honestly, I don’t think it will be long before we see a woman break through this NFL barrier,” Brandt wrote on Twitter. “I’d give (Lloyd) an honest tryout if I were, say, the Bears.” The Bears have been on the hunt for a kicker ever since dismissing Cody Parkey, whose last-gasp miss against the Eagles in their January wild-card playoff game ended Chicago’s season. DOUBLE DOINK!#FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/F4bJ4ANUuq Parkey was one of five kickers on Chicago’s payroll at some point last season and no less than five others have tried out for the job during the preseason, with 23-year-old Eddy Pineiro emerging as the frontrunner. Brandt, 86, was the chief talent scout for the Cowboys from 1960 through 1988, earning a reputation for unconventional methods including the mining of other sports for NFL stars, including Bob Hayes, Cornell Green, Peter Gent, Toni Fritsch, Percy Howard, Ken Johnson, Ron Howard, Wade Manning and Manny Hendrix. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame earlier this year.
