Bury have had a fifth game suspended by the EFL, as a local MP urged Manchester United and City to help their crisis-hit neighbours. Bury’s League One match at Rotherham on Tuesday 20 August has been suspended. The club have yet to play this season and have been threatened with expulsion from the Football League over their financial problems. Ivan Lewis, the Independent MP for Bury South, has called on Bury’s Premier League neighbours to assist, and for a further meeting of stakeholders to find a way forward. “I urge Manchester City and Manchester United, two global footballing giants, to step up to the plate and see what they can do to help save the club,” he wrote on Twitter. “The clock is ticking and we now need a new approach as a matter of urgency.” Lewis also called on Dale, the Forever Bury supporters’ trust, James Frith (the Labour MP for Bury North) and the leader of the local council to meet him urgently. “We cannot allow strong feelings and differences of opinion to end with the club going out of existence,” Lewis said. The latest suspension comes after the EFL failed to receive financial commitments it had requested from the Bury owner, Steve Dale. “The EFL has made it clear that it cannot continue suspending fixtures indefinitely and the deadline of 23 August for withdrawal of membership remains in place,” a statement said. The statement added the EFL “remains committed to working with the club to try to find a successful conclusion,” and that a decision on Bury’s match at Tranmere on Saturday 24 August would be taken early next week.
