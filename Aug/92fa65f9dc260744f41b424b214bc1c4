The stars lie by our feet and astral debris scatters the stage. In Working on My Night Moves, two New Zealand artists deconstruct the black box theatre and turn its remnants into the outer edges of a back hole. Certain moments of this performance art piece have an unearthly beauty, but it is so vague as to be a rorschach test, and has all the energy of watching a post-show get-out. Julia Croft is the architect of this disruption, supported by designer Nisha Madhan. To the electric frisson of radio static, that occasionally resolves into ethereal pop songs, the pair upend gravity. Imagery from The Wizard of Oz coats the dark room and we are placed in the eye of Dorothy’s storm, where time is paused and home seems impossibly far away. Croft climbs into Dorothy’s gingham dress and gorges on the celestial wreckage, before shedding layers of costume and leaving them dangling in orbit. To write it down makes too much sense of it; this show is all chaos and process and good ideas rolled so thin you can barely tell what they once were. Perhaps Working on My Night Moves explores women’s place in astronomy, or the dismantling of existing structures and creation of new ones. Or maybe they just wanted to bring the stars closer. But in the moment, the show feels far less epic than all of that. At first we’re immersed with the pair, but we’re quickly shuffled to the safety of our seats. When they lie down to watch the stars creep across the walls, I want to join them. Instead, Working on My Night Moves has the emotional impact of being stuck at HQ, watching the astronauts through a screen. I can do without understanding it all, but I at least want it to make me feel. • At Summerhall, Old Lab, Edinburgh, until 25 August.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.
