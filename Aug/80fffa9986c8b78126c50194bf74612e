Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to form a caretaker government to stop a no-deal Brexit has received mixed reactions from other opposition leaders and rebel Tories – so would he be able to gain a majority? A number of MPs will want to wait to see how events unfold when parliament returns in September before making their decision. The vast majority of Conservatives are not prepared to bring down their own government – and even those vehemently opposed to a no-deal Brexit do not want to hand Corbyn the keys to No 10. One Tory who would consider the plan is Guto Bebb, who said a short-term Corbyn government would be less damaging than “the generational damage that would be caused by a no-deal Brexit”. The former justice minister Phillip Lee is also a possible supporter, having openly suggested he could quit the Conservatives. The Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and the Green party’s Caroline Lucas are prepared to engage with the proposal. Of the 14 Liberal Democrat MPs, Chuka Umunna, who abandoned Labour last year in protest at the leadership, may be loth to support any action that could put Corbyn in power, even if the rest of his new party did. Other ex-Labour MPs, such as Ian Austin, John Woodcock and Frank Field, are also unlikely to want to put Corbyn in No 10. And there is a further complication that some Labour backbenchers, such as Kate Hoey, want Brexit delivered. As for the remaining 13 Lib Dems, the leader, Jo Swinson, has backtracked on her initial hostility to Corbyn’s proposal, saying she is open to talks and would not rule out backing him if it would stop no deal. Assuming Corbyn had the support of the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Green party and his own backbenchers, the question would be whether the Labour MPs who left the party because of his leadership, as well as several Tory rebels, could be persuaded to back the plan.
