A uniquely satisfying collaboration is on the cards: actor and musician Jack Black has worked with Jack White to create a partnership that has, inevitably, been dubbed Jack Grey. Black made the announcement during a Tenacious D concert, saying he and White had met for a recording session at White’s home in Nashville: “We went over to his house today and recorded a brand new song.” No further details have been announced about the track. The collaboration has been joked about since the early 2000s, when both figures gained popularity. White met Black in 2006 at the MTV Music Video Awards, but nothing further came of the encounter. The partnership was mooted again in June this year, after Tenacious D posted a selfie with White to Instagram, with the caption: “We hired a new merch guy.” The two met again in a London airport after White’s band, the Raconteurs, had played All Points East and Tenacious D played Wembley Arena.
