Israeli forces have shot dead four Palestinian militants near the border with Gaza, the Israeli military said. In a post on Twitter, the Israel Defense Forces said the men were armed with assault rifles, anti-tank missiles and hand grenades, one of which was hurled at their troops. “Once one of the terrorists crossed into Israel, our troops opened fire.” These are the weapons possessed by the terrorists who attempted to infiltrate into Israel from Gaza last night.Their (unfulfilled) objective: murdering Israelis. pic.twitter.com/sQbMPK59sX There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials in Gaza or from militant groups in the territory. Gaza is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel over the past decade. Israel pulled its troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but keeps the enclave under a blockade, citing security concerns. Tensions along the border are high with frequent fatalities.
