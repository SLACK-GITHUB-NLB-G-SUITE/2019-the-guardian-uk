The birth rate in England and Wales has hit the lowest level since records began, government statistics have shown. In total, there were 657,076 live births in England and Wales last year – a fall of 3.2% from the previous year and down by 10% from 2012. The number of live births fell from 11.6 to 11.1 per 1,000 people – the lowest since records started in 1938. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also showed the proportion of live babies born to mothers who were not born in the UK also fell for the first time since 1990, from 28.4% to 28.2%. Since 1947, the rate has dropped by 45.9%, when the number of babies being born was at its ultimate peak. Although Britain’s ageing population means the proportion of older people compared with women of childbearing age is increasing, the record low in crude birth rates is mostly being driven by falling fertility rates. Except for 1977 and the period between 1999 and 2002, total fertility rates are also lower than all previous years since records began. ONS figures show that overall fertility rates stood at 1.7 children per woman in 2018, a 3.4% decrease from the year before, when the rate was 1.76. While crude birth rates are calculated per 1,000 of the entire population, regardless of their sex or age, total fertility rates refer only to women between 15 and 44 years old, who are deemed to be of childbearing age. Although women aged 40 and over were the only demographic for whom the rate of fertility did not fall, 2018 saw the rate stall for the first time since the 1970s, at 16.1 per 1,000. As has been the trend since the millennium, fertility rates fell for women under 20 years of age. In 2018, the number of births per 1,000 women in the group dropped to 11.9 – down 6.3% from the previous year. Although before 2004 women aged 25 to 29 generally had the highest fertility rate, for the past 15 years women aged 30 to 34 have taken the lead. Ann Berrington, a professor in demography and social statistics at the University of Southampton, said the reasons for the decline were likely to differ between age groups. As well as “changing aspirations”, Berrington highlighted education and expectations among the possible reasons that fewer teenagers are having babies. “There’s been government legislation which means the school leaving age has increased to 18. There’s also been significant improvements in the availability of emergency and long-acting contraception,” she said. Berrington added that she thought people in their 20s and 30s were more likely to postpone having children because of practical factors like the lack of affordable housing. In the same year, stillbirths reached a record low for the second year running, with 4.1 per 1,000 total births.
