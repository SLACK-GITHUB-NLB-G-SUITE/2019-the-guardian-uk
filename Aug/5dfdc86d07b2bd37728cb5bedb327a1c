Passengers travelling with British Airways from London airports have been delayed by cancellations due to an IT failure. Issues experienced by customers include checking in online at London Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports. The glitch has caused queues in airport departure areas as staff have struggled to check in passengers. The airline said it has moved to back-up manual systems to keep some flights operating.
