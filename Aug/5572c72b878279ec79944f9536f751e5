Ravel Morrison has hit out at Glen Johnson after the former England defender criticised Saido Berahino for having “the wrong attitude during their spell together at Stoke City. The Burundi forward was released by Stoke on Wednesday with three years left on the contract he signed in January 2017 and is now expected to join Belgian side Zulte Waregem having spent part of pre-season with the Belgian club. Stoke are believed to have paid out more than £2m to buy out his contract having spent £12m on purchasing him from West Brom, with the 26-year-old scoring just five goals in 56 appearances for the club. He was also convicted of drinking and driving in May, fined £75,000 and banned from driving for 30 months before appearing for his country at the African Cup of Nations. Appearing on TalkSPORT on Thursday morning, Johnson – who played with Berahino for one year – launched a scathing attack on his former teammate where he questioned his motivation. “He had the wrong mentality, the wrong attitude from day one,” said Johnson. “He was always going against the grain. It was like he had a vendetta. It was every day. I didn’t like him. If we were told to wear this, he’d wear something different. If I was a manager or an owner of a club I wouldn’t take him if you paid me.” Those comments have led Morrison, who joined Sheffield United last month on a one-year deal, to defend his former England’s Under-21 colleague. “@glen_johnson trying to destroy people’s careers,” he wrote on Twitter. “How can you speak about people like that in public. @SBerahino good luck at your new team. I hope you work hard get back to your best and get back we’re [SIC] you belong. God bless.”
