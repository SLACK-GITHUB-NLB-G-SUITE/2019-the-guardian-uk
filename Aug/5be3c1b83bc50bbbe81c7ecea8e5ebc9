Bianca Andreescu delivered Canada a home champion at the Rogers Cup in Toronto but her victory did not come in the way she may have hoped. In the men’s final Rafael Nadal won his fifth Rogers Cup title with a comfortable 6-3, 6-0 win over Daniil Medvedev. The 19-year-old Andreescu, who became the first Canadian woman to reach the final of the tournament since 1969, took the title after Serena Williams had to retire with a back injury in the first set. Andreescu was leading 3-1 at the time. “I’m speechless right now. I’m the first Canadian to make the final and win this tournament since 1969,” said Andreescu after the match. “This week has not been easy, I’ve had many many tough matches, and especially what I’ve been through the last two months hasn’t been easy. I kept telling myself never give up.” Williams appeared to be in tears as she was treated by the trainer, and TV microphones picked up a mention of back spasms when she talked to Andreescu after the match. She had beaten Naomi Osaka, who she faced in last year’s US Open final, in the quarter-finals. This year’s US Open starts later this month. “I’m sorry I can’t do it today, I tried but I just couldn’t do it,” said Williams at the post-match presentation. “Bianca, you are a great sportswoman. Thanks to my team. It’s been a tough year, but we’ll keep going.” Andreescu has faced a similar situation to Williams this year: she was forced to withdraw from the French Open and has missed the last few months with injury. It is her second title since springing to prominence after winning the Indian Wells title in March. Williams has not won a title since returning from the birth of her daughter although she has reached three grand slam finals since then.
