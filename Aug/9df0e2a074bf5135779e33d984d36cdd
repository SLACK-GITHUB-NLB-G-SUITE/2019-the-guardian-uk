A group of metal detectorists have been taken to hospital after eating cake reportedly infused with cannabis at an event in South Yorkshire. Fifteen people were taken ill at the Coil to the Soil national metal detecting event in Doncaster on Saturday. Yorkshire ambulance service said it had received an emergency call just before 6.30pm reporting that people had become ill after “ingesting an unknown substance”. Eight ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, two doctors, two clinical supervisors and a hazardous area response team were dispatched to the scene. “Fifteen patients were treated by ambulance service staff on scene and 13 of those were conveyed to hospitals in South Yorkshire for further care,” the ambulance service said. South Yorkshire police said an investigation was under way and that a woman had been arrested. They said the men and women who were hospitalised had all since been discharged. “A 48-year-old woman from County Durham was arrested in connection to the incident and has since been bailed whilst enquiries continue,” said a police statement. Julian Evan-Hart, the editor of Treasure Hunting magazine, wrote on Facebook that the cake had been “spiked”, which he described as “inconsiderate, irresponsible, stupid and foolish”. “This isn’t a poor reflection on our hobby, the dig organisers or anyone else involved in the planning of the event. It’s just a case of random lunacy.” He later posted: “I have heard all affected are now well again and that is the only thing that is now important. So after learning from this event, ladies and gents, it’s back to the crunch of stubble, sun cream, and making a colossal contribution to our heritage.”
