Preti Taneja writes that the “mass of papers in the UN archives since 1947 reveal much international diplomacy, but a lack of political will to intervene” on Kashmir (What is happening in Kashmir? The best books to help understand, 15 August). Forget intervention, there is no political will even to condemn Narendra Modi’s action in Kashmir. Is there any book that explains the reason for that? My guess is “trade deals”.Asad Ali AbbasiLondon • Re the news that National Grid had three blackout near-misses in three months (Report, 13 August), what is going to happen when we all have electric cars? We’ll get home for tea and plug in…Bridget ArreggerLong Buckby, Northamptonshire • It is hard to disagree with the choice of Joni Mitchell’s top 10 albums (G2, 16 August). But I was surprised at the omission of Miles of Aisles (1974).

Wearing these would surely fool any facial recognition technology.Ron BrewerNorfolk • Thank you for Ian Sample’s piece on coprolites (Parasites wormed their way into ‘Fenland Pompeii’, 16 August). Not just a model of reporting but a delightful read.John DwyerLeatherhead, Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
