England have dropped Moeen Ali for the second Ashes Test with the all-rounder to be replaced in the squad for Lord’s by the Somerset left-arm spinner, Jack Leach. The England selectors have named a 12-strong squad to face Australia in the second Test which begins on Wednesday next week. Leach, who has only five Tests under his belt, was man of the match in the warm-up Test against Ireland last month when he scored 92 with the bat after coming in as a nightwatchman. Elsewhere, Olly Stone has injured his back and joins James Anderson on the sidelines, both having been included in the England squad for the first Test at Edgbaston. The England squad meets up in London on Sunday as they bid to level the series after Australia took a 1–0 lead following their 239-run win in the first Test. England second Test squad to play Australia: Joe Root (Yorkshire) captain, Jofra Archer (Sussex), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Rory Burns (Surrey), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Sam Curran (Surrey), Joe Denly (Kent), Jack Leach (Somerset), Jason Roy (Surrey), Ben Stokes (Durham), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire).
