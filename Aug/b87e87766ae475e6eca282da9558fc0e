Dave Chappelle … and/or a random Ukrainian comedian who I saw at a comedy club in LA in the mid-90s who made me pee my pants. Never seen him again, so, yeah, Dave Chappelle. Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Monty Python’s Life of Brian, anything with Nicolas Cage. I once wore, for a period of time, a waistcoat with a silver, embossed eagle on the back of it, and with it I wore a bow tie. I’m still looking for this. Although I once swallowed a bug and was completely distraught and that made other people laugh. I once had a rattail and I would wear a bandana with it to give it style. When I was in school in the 80s, I had a dream that Barry Manilow was a serial killer and was chasing me around the theatre where we were rehearsing the school play. So I hid out in an old age [people’s] home next door, only to find that the pope was there and he was playing lead guitar with the Beatles, but no one was attending the concert because Dynasty was on at the same time. I bet you Netflix would buy that idea today … Ass clown. Also, Engelbert Humperdinck. Aasif Mandvi stars in This Way Up, Thursday 5 September, 10pm, Channel 4
