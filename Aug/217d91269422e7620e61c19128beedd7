Authorities say a surfer at a Florida beach caught air on a wave and landed on a shark that, in turn, bit him on the hand and calf. Donald Walsh tells The Daytona Beach News-Journal that he had been surfing at New Smyrna Beach for several hours Tuesday when he decided to try going airborne before leaving for the day. Ocean Rescue Capt Tamra Malphurs says that’s when Walsh, of Mims, landed on the 6.5ft shark in waist-deep water and suffered lacerations that weren’t considered life-threatening. The 40-year-old Walsh says he didn’t see the shark below him as he landed in the water, but the shark’s bite brought it into focus. Walsh says he’ll be back in the water as soon as his wounds heal a bit.
