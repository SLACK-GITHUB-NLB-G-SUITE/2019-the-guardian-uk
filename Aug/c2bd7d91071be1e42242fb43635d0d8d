Internazionale have scoured the world for a new striker and, presumably after sending scouts to Newport County’s training ground have spotted young talent Wilfried Bony, who has been training with the League Two club since being released this summer. The Ivorian has endured a few underwhelming years at Manchester City, Stoke and Swansea in recent times. He’s free, at least. It’s an absolutely bumper Rumour Mill for Serie A clubs raiding south Wales for strikers. Sampdoria have half an eye on André Ayew at Swansea as he is competent and probably available at the right price. The latest potential swap deal involving Neymar to Real Madrid apparently would need to include Brazilian teenager Vinicius Junior, whose arrival in the French capital would appease Paris Saint-Germain. Meanwhile, Barcelona bigwigs are having a natter about whether they should bother to bring their former forward back to the Camp Nou. Liverpool striker and Steven Gerrard blood relative Bobby Duncan missed the club’s Under-23 fixture against Southampton on Monday, as he looks to be heading out on loan. The Rangers manager’s cousin has interested Fiorentina and FC Nordsjælland in recent weeks. Nemanja Matic is not currently playing with the big boys at Manchester United, so wants a chat with Ole Gunnar Solskjær to find out why he’s not deemed good enough to be in a team beaten at home by Crystal Palace. Spanish full-back Nacho Monreal will be allowed to head back to his homeland to join Real Sociedad, if he so wants, as Arsenal are a lovely club. Tammy Abraham’s reward for scoring against Norwich will be a new £100,000 per week deal at Chelsea. Next he’ll be getting a helicopter to training. And there’s a £200,000 weekly contract on the table for Christian Eriksen at Spurs, but he is not interested. The Dane wants a move to Spain next summer when his contract expires instead.
