Australian choreographer Lina Limosani and British Bharatanatyam artist Seeta Patel take to task rightwing revisionism and the whitewashing of colonial history in this deft and pertinent piece of dance theatre. In this context, Bharatanatyam is a particularly charged form of storytelling given that 19th-century British colonial officials and Christian missionaries labelled traditional Indian dance degenerate and demanded its suppression. Spry and fluently expressive, Patel mesmerises with the expansive curlicue of her arms and the firefly flutter of her fingers, while a voiceover places us firmly in the realm of exotic myth, describing a land of “faraway folk” replete with “chocolate rivers” and “beasts without claws”. A dangling rope representing the former’s soft, luxuriant hair is set against a series of shard-like metal frames that evoke western cityscapes and approaching imperial boats. The strikingly textured and tactile quality of these few props cleverly underscores the bald material reality of colonialism that’s trussed up with a narrative of benevolence and bravery. Saccharine fairytale soon merges with realpolitik as the voiceover gives way to a jarring collage of cut-glass reportage and familiar oratory, including snatches of Roosevelt’s “infamy” speech and a hint of Thatcher. Here, Patel shows her mettle as a contemporary dancer, with a statesmanlike stance undercut by jabbering, maniacal judders of energy. Sliding into the realm of alternative facts – “It happened, it did not happen, it perhaps could have happened” intones the voiceover – Patel smears white gloop against a transparent screen as her obscured, silently-mouthing figure morphs into a dancing shadow with an elongated head, an embodiment of alien darkness. A punchy and expertly performed response to today’s increasing political grotesquerie. • At Zoo Southside, Edinburgh, until 24 August. • Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.
