What’s going for it? Chichester is so generally lovely, it’s impossible to be rude about it. For a city of its relatively small size, it’s well-rounded, nicely brought up. Every base is covered. It has ancient history – buttercrosses, green men, bell towers, Roman baths, the works – and fine contemporary architecture, including a surprisingly super selection of postwar homes. It has the best seaside, up the road in the dreamy dunes of West Wittering, and the beautiful hills of the South Downs (including – top trivia – Britain’s only yew forest). It also punches well above its weight culturally, with a Chagall stained-glass window in the cathedral, film festivals and poetry slams, and the Festival theatre and Pallant House art gallery’s Hepworths and Hamiltons. Traffic on the A27 and house prices aside – a mighty big aside – this place has no dark side, unless it’s hidden deep in its repressed past. It is sunshine in bricks and mortar, which, for some, might be the most annoying thing in the universe. The case against… Those looking for even a bit of edge should probably go to Portsmouth. There could be a touch fewer chains in town. Well connected? Trains: to Southampton (52 to 58 minutes) and Portsmouth (23 to 37 minutes); and to Brighton (50 to 60 minutes); Gatwick Airport (one hour); and London (90 minutes). Driving: 15 minutes to the A3, 25 to Portsmouth, 50 to Southampton; 15 minutes to the sandy dunes at the Witterings, 10 minutes to be on the South Downs. Schools Primaries: Jessie Younghusband, Parklands Community, Portfield, St Richard’s Catholic, Chichester Free and Fishbourne CofE are all “good”, says Ofsted, with St Anthony’s “outstanding”. Secondaries: St Anthony’s and Chichester Free are “good”, with Chichester High and Bishop Luffa CofE “outstanding”. Hang out at… The wonderful, independent New Park cinema. There is room for improvement in its eating scene. Most of the pulls round here are out of town (the Earl of March and the Royal Oak in the Lavants, Cassons in Tangmere or the Richmond Arms in West Ashling). Where to buy The entire centre is a conservation area, and it shows. You won’t want for idyllic Georgian townhouses or 17th-century cottages tucked down lanes; but keep an eye out for some great postwar property, too. The historic roads out of town, such as Westgate, are also studded with beauties. For suburbans, north is most popular, edging the Downs, like Summersdale and Fishbourne.

Not enough good pubs.” Rachael Tout “The small shops in Draper’s Yard are the best.” • Do you live in Chichester? Join the debate below. Do you live in Ormeau, Belfast?
