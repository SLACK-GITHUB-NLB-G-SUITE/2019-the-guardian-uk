Bolton face another points deduction from the EFL after unilaterally postponing Tuesday’s League One home game with Doncaster. “Welfare” concerns were cited regarding younger players being forced to play in all four games of the new season. Bolton went into administration in May and are prevented from signing new players. The decision to postpone the match was taken without consulting Doncaster or the league which is to refer Bolton to an independent commission. If found guilty of a charge of gross misconduct the club will lose points, with the EFL having docked them 12 points for entering administration. The EFL expects the game against Doncaster to be played at some point. Bolton’s final match of last season against Brentford was also not played. This case is yet to be referred to a commission and may be heard alongside that of the Doncaster game. The visit of Doncaster was called off by Bolton’s joint-administrator Paul Appleton. A Doncaster statement said: “Bolton Wanderers have postponed this game without the agreement of Rovers or the EFL, and we were surprised to learn of the news via Bolton’s social media. We have a lot of sympathy for Bolton’s plight but we’ve prepared for this game as normal and fully expected it to go ahead. “We will work with the EFL to understand this situation and keep supporters as informed as we can when we are able to say more.” Bolton are hopeful a takeover by Football Ventures will be completed soon. Their next game is at home to Ipswich on Saturday.
