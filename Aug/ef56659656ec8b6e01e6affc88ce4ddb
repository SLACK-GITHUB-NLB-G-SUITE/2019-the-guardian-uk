“We asked the people to vote on whether they wanted to stay in or leave the EU. They voted to leave by a big majority,” said Boris Johnson (‘Grave abuse of power’ if PM shuts parliament to force no-deal Brexit, 27 August). The 52:48 result is a small majority, and it wasn’t a majority at all in many parts of Britain. If this is a matter for “parliamentarians to get right ourselves”, it would help if our prime minister could understand the numbers, and respect all of us: parliamentarians, electorate and the children who are too young to vote. I visited the Peterloo Memorial in Manchester on Monday and was reminded of the sacrifices of 200 years ago. If Johnson even considers proroguing parliament to prevent our MPs opposing his will, this will be a fine memorial for 2019.Susan TreagusManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
