The United States is reeling from a weekend of deadly gun violence after two mass shootings in two American cities left at least 29 people dead and more than 50 injured. The shootings occurred within 13 hours of each other. In El Paso, Texas, a border city in the state’s south-west, at least 20 people were killed after a gunman opened fire with a military style rifle at a busy Walmart store on Saturday afternoon. The incident was being investigated as a hate crime after the gunman was apprehended by law enforcement. The shooting was described by Texas governor Greg Abbott “one of the deadliest days in Texas history”. The gunman was named by local law enforcement sources as 21 year-old Patrick Crusius. In Dayton, Ohio, at least nine people were killed after a shooter dressed in body armour and using high calibre ammunition opened fire in a busy downtown neighbourhood early on Sunday morning. The gunman has not been named and was killed by law enforcement who responded to the shooting within a minute of the gunman opening fire. The city’s mayor Mayor Nan Whaley described the shooting as “a terribly sad day for our city”. Donald Trump, spending the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, tweeted on Sunday morning: “God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio.” The president had yet to address the public in person. The shooting in Ohio marked the 31st deadly mass shooting in America this year, defined as those where at least three people are killed by gun violence in a single episode. In the El Paso shooting, Mexico’s president Manuel Lopez Obrador, said three Mexican nationals were among the dead and six were wounded. El Paso has at least an 80% Hispanic population and constant comings and goings with its sister city Juarez immediately over the border in Mexico. More than 23,000 pedestrians cross from Ciudad Juárez to El Paso to work every day.
