A woman has died after she fell from a cliff in Sydney’s eastern suburbs known for being a popular selfie destination, with witnesses telling police she may have been taking photos at the time. Emergency services were called to Diamond Bay Reserve in Vaucluse about 11.20am on Saturday following reports a woman had fallen 30 metres on to rocks below, police said. The woman – who is believed to be 27 and from Sydney – was treated by bystanders after she fell, but died at the scene. A rescue operation – involving police, paramedics, a rescue helicopter and surf lifesavers – was unable to save her. Her body was retrieved from the rocks by PolAir. Choppers everywhere at #DiamondBay. Looks like a rescue or a retrieval.

NSW police said in a statement: “Witnesses have told police the woman may have been taking photos when she fell.” Diamond Bay has become a hotspot for tourists in recent times, with visitors often seen climbing the fence to take photos on the cliff ledge. In June, the Waverly council passed a motion saying it would crack down on thrillseekers risking their lives for a selfie at Diamond Bay. The council agreed to investigate ways to restrict or deter movement around the area, including the installation of CCTV, more physical barriers, multilingual signage and more frequent ranger patrols – particularly on weekends. “There is an ongoing and justifiable concern that visitors are irresponsibly endangering themselves and others by crossing over fencing and boundary lines and positioning themselves on the cliff ledge,” the motion noted.
