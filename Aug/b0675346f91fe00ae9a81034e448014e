Wales have been dealt a second major World Cup injury blow with fly-half Gareth Anscombe being ruled out of the tournament. The Ospreys No10, an integral part of Wales’ Six Nations title and grand slam-winning campaign last season, suffered a knee injury during Sunday’s World Cup warm-up defeat against England at Twickenham. He follows Bath No 8 Taulupe Faletau, who suffered a broken collarbone during Wales training, in missing the competition. “Gareth Anscombe is out of Rugby World Cup contention after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the match against England yesterday,” read a statement from the Welsh Rugby Union. “His prognosis and management with be determined following further specialist reviews. The Wales squad and management would like to wish Gareth the very best with his recovery.” Anscombe, 28, was helped from the field just before half-time as Wales went down to a 33-19 loss. He has won 27 caps, but now misses out on the chance to represent Wales in Japan. Dan Biggar is the obvious candidate to reclaim Wales’ No 10 shirt – he has won more than 70 caps and scored almost 350 Test points – with Rhys Patchell and Jarrod Evans also options. Wales continue their World Cup warm-up Tests against England in Cardiff next Saturday, which is followed by home and away appointments with Ireland. Head coach Warren Gatland is due to name his final 31-man World Cup squad on 1 September – 22 days before the tournament opener against Georgia in Toyota City.
