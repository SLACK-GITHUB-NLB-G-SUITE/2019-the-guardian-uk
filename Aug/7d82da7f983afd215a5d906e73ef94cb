Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. The wooden worktops on our ageing Ikea kitchen look awful. I don’t want to buy more and face all the oiling and so on, so what do I put in its place? It needs to be cheap, maintenance-free and easy to clean. What would you do? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
