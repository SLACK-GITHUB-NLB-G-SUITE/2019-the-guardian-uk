The England right-back Lucy Bronze has been named alongside her Lyon teammates Ada Hegerberg and Amandine Henry for the 2018-19 Uefa Women’s Player of the Year award. Bronze, who is widely regarded as the best full-back in the world, is the first England player to have made the top three in its seven-year history. Having picked up her second consecutive Champions League winners’ medal in May following a move from Manchester City in 2017, the 27-year-old was a key part of Phil Neville’s Lionesses team and scored a wonderful rising volley from a Beth Mead set piece to cap England’s most complete performance in the World Cup, a 3-0 victory over Norway in Le Havre, before their exit to the eventual champions, the USA, at the semi-final stage. Bronze made the shortlist ahead of her compatriot Ellen White, who placed fifth on the released long-list. The Norwegian striker Hegerberg – a high-profile absence from the World Cup having stepped back from the national team after a disappointing Euro 2017 with misgivings over the Norwegian FA’s governance of the women’s game – is named alongside Bronze following a stunning 16-minute hat-trick in the Champions League final against Barcelona to complete another trophy-laden season. Hegerberg, who won the Uefa award in 2016, has won 13 of 15 available trophies since joining the French champions. The midfield linchpin Henry captained France during their home World Cup and, like Bronze, saw her promising campaign ended by the US after scoring an extra-time winner against Brazil to ensure their passage from the last 16. All three are also on the 12-player nominee list for The Best Fifa women’s player of the year. The award will be presented to the winner during the Champions League group stage draw in Monaco on 29 August.
