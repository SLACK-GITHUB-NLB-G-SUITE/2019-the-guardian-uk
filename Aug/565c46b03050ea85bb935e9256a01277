This opportunity to revisit Hitchcock's 1946 spy drama Notorious comes courtesy of an Ingrid Bergman season at London's BFI Southbank. Bergman is Alicia Huberman, the hard-drinking socialite daughter of a convicted Nazi spy; government agent Devlin (Cary Grant) sees behind her bravado to find anger and shame, and offers redemption: to spy for the US. She must travel with him to Rio and seduce Nazi conspirator Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains) to find out what he is planning. But Devlin falls in love with Alicia and the besotted Sebastian also complicates things by proposing marriage, to the horror of his formidable and suspicious mother (Leopoldine Konstantin). Notorious has fascinating echoes of other Hitchcock movies such as Rebecca and Psycho. A must-see or must-see-again.
