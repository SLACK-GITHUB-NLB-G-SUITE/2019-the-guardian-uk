I am 78. In the last few years and days I have been blamed for bed blocking, crisis in care, Brexit, “unconscious bias learned from the older generation” (Duke of Sussex), eating too early (Grace Dent, 27 July) and benefiting from the advantages of my generation (good pensions, free TV licences, cheap housing and free education). For many years I was seen as having made a valuable contribution to society when I worked as a teacher with families whose children had special needs, a role I thoroughly enjoyed. Sadly I am now too old to continue this work. Despite my age, I am chair of a playgroup in a socially difficult area, a volunteer for a listening service and help my family in any way I can. Am I worth my place in society, despite the fact that my children blame me for Brexit?Elaine HerbertSolihull, West Midlands • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
