Mauricio Pochettino said he has turned down “plenty” of job offers in England and overseas during his five years at Tottenham. The manager has endured a difficult summer, with unease over transfers and how best to refresh the team. He is conscious of the downward trends at Spurs in terms of Premier League results, with the 86-point finish in 2016-17 followed by 77 in 2017-18 and 71 last time. Going back to February, Tottenham have won only four of 15 league games, losing eight. But Pochettino is determined to fire an upturn, starting at Arsenal on Sunday, and his commitment to Spurs remains extraordinary. Asked whether he had turned down offers to leave, Pochettino said: “Plenty in five years and Daniel [Levy, the chairman] knows. Some, not all! They were from everywhere. Daniel knows very well how our commitment with the club is. It’s massive – more than what is normal. “If you analyse last season, we need to improve in the Premier League. In the last part of last season we went a little bit down but we kept the season alive and the perception was good because we progressed [to the final] in the Champions League. “But now we need to try to push again. That is why we need to be on the same page – the club, Daniel and us in our vision and plans for the future. “I am very happy to be here, very proud. Five years ago, we started a project at a very different club. Now, we are one of the best clubs in the world. We have played in the final of the Champions League and now the aim is to remain competitive.”
