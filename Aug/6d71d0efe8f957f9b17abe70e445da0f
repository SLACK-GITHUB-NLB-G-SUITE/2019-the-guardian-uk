Home and Away actor Ben Unwin has died aged 41, New South Wales police have confirmed. The actor, who appeared as cult character Jesse McGregor in the long-running soap opera, was found dead close to Australia’s eastern Gold Coast on 14 August. The cause of death is currently unknown. “Police attended Minyon Falls, Whian Whian, responding to a concern for welfare”, NSW police said in a statement. “The body of a 41-year-old man was located. The death has not been treated as suspicious.” Unwin appeared in Home and Away between 1996 and 2000 and again from 2002 to 2005. He was nominated for a British National Television award in 1997 for his performance as McGregor, a roguish character who was sent to prison after being falsely accused of burning down a local bait shop. After returning to Home and Away in 2000, Unwin left the soap for good in 2005 to complete a law degree. He later worked as a solicitor in Sydney. In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a a spokesperson for Home and Away broadcaster Channel 7 said that the show’s cast and crew were “saddened to learn of the passing of former cast mate, Ben Unwin. Ben’s work in the role of Jesse McGregor is remembered with much affection. Ben’s family and friends are in our thoughts and prayers.” Kimberley Cooper, who played Gypsy Nash in Home and Away, also paid tribute to her former co-star on Instagram. “We had years of laughter, be it giggles on set trying to get through scenes as lovers or doubled over belly laughs at the pubs after work. I will be sad for now, but I promise to tell stories of great joy about our times together. You forever hold a special place in my heart. Love you Onion.”
