A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already been signed by more than 580,000 people. It was launched on Tuesday by Mark Johnston, a pro-EU campaigner from Reigate in Kent, a day before Boris Johnson announced his request to suspend parliament. The text of the petition reads: “Parliament must not be prorogued or dissolved unless and until the article 50 period has been sufficiently extended or the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU has been cancelled.” By early afternoon on Wednesday it had already attracted more than 100,000 signatories, passing the threshold to be considered for a debate in parliament. By 6pm more than 580,000 had signed. In some remain-backing areas more than 2% of constituents had signed, according to a map attached to the petition. They included parliamentary seats in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Sheffield, Cambridge, Oxford, Bath, Brighton and Bristol. In Jeremy Corbyn’s constituency of Islington North it attracted more than 3,200 signatures, while in Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip more than 630 had signed by 6pm on Wednesday. It is the fastest-growing parliamentary petition since more than 6 million people signed a statement calling for article 50 to be revoked earlier this year.
