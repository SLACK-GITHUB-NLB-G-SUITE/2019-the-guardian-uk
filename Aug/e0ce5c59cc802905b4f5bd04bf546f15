Uefa has agreed a compromise with top clubs to cap ticket prices for away fans in the Champions League and Europa League this season. Starting from next month’s opening group fixtures, away tickets will cost a maximum of €70 (£63.50) in the Champions League and €45 (£41) in the Europa League. British and German fans have been complaining about the extortionate cost of some away tickets, particularly in Spain, for several years. Last season, Manchester United and Liverpool responded to Barcelona’s high prices – more than £100 for last season’s Champions League quarter-final at Camp Nou – by raising their prices for visiting Barça fans and using the additional revenue to subsidise their fans’ costs in Spain. United also did this for Sevilla when they met in the last 16 of the Champions League in 2018. It is understood Uefa, with the support of Bayern Munich and the Premier League clubs, has been pushing hard for a price cap for months but clubs in Spain and other southern European countries were less keen. The capped prices are higher than some will have hoped for.
