Manchester certainly needs to write Peterloo into its map, but Piccadilly Station is the wrong side of town, and St Peter’s Square is too well-established (Letters, 21 August). The ideal place is the large paved area in front of Manchester Central, where the new Peterloo memorial stands. Not only is it the home of the memorial; it is adjacent to the site of the massacre (now built up) and it is a very political space. The Manchester Central complex is now used not only for party conferences but, more importantly, for the counting of votes at council and general elections – the very thing for which the Peterloo demonstrators campaigned and for which some lost their lives. In addition, no one knows what this space is called. This is the area which should commemorate Peterloo’s significance to Greater Manchester and British democracy by becoming Peterloo Square.Harriet MonkhouseManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
