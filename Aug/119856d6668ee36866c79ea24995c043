George Morris, a 1960 Olympic show jumping medalist and longtime equestrian coach and trainer, has received a lifetime ban for sexual misconduct involving a minor, a case that he says has roots that are more than 50 years old and that he will appeal. The US Center for SafeSport placed the ban for the 81-year-old Morris on its website Monday. A spokesperson for the independent investigative body tasked with probing sexual misconduct in Olympic sports called it the most severe it’s meted out, according to the New York Times. Morris, who became one of the sport’s most renowned trainers after winning Olympic silver as the show jumping team’s youngest member in Rome, and went on to coach the US and Brazilian teams. In a statement, Morris said he will appeal the ban, which stems from “events that allegedly occurred between 1968 and 1972”. “Any allegations that suggest I have acted in ways that are harmful to any individual, the broader equestrian community and sport that I love dearly are false and hurtful,” he said. This year, the US Equestrian Federation updated its bylaws to officially bring trainers, who often operate as independent contractors, under the umbrella of its safe-sport policy. Morris accepted the role of US show jumping chef d’equipe in 2005, leading the American team to a victory in the 2005 Samsung Super League series, a team silver at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games and a team gold at the 2008 Olympic Games. His last championship with the US team came at the 2012 London Olympics, and afterward he assumed the role for the Brazilian team for Rio 2016.
