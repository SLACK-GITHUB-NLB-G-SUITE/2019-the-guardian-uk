Bollywood actor Sunny Leone has apologised after a man was inundated with calls when his phone number was used in her recent release, Arjun Patiala. Puneet Agarwal has received hundreds of calls since the film’s release on 26 July. Leone’s character gives the phone number to another character in the film. Agarwal is quoted as saying: “I started receiving calls from unknown people asking me to let them talk to Sunny Leone. Initially, I thought somebody is playing a prank on me, but after a while, I got to know that the makers of the movie have actually used my number.” “I am being harassed by many callers, people are abusing me and asking me to do dirty favours. I have filed a police complaint but till now the police have not taken any action, even after giving me assurances.” According to the Times of India, Leone, who has a small role in the film, apologised in an interview on ZoomTV.com. Agarwal says he is considering legal action.
