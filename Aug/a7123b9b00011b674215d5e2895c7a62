Leroy Sané is facing a lengthy injury lay‑off after sustaining anterior cruciate ligament damage. Sané limped off with a knee problem in the early stages of the Community Shield win against Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday and the German winger will undergo surgery in the coming week, Manchester City have announced. The injury comes after a summer of speculation over the 23-year-old’s future, with Bayern Munich having been repeatedly linked with the player. Sané has been offered a new contract at City but has not yet signed. He has two years left on his present deal. “Leroy will have surgery in the coming week,” a club statement said. “Manchester City will provide Leroy with all the support and guidance he needs, and everyone connected with the club wishes him a quick and full recovery.” The news is a blow to Pep Guardiola, who had appeared determined to prevent Sané from returning to Germany before the European transfer window closed, but he will now have to manage without the winger for several months. City have made four summer signings but have not bolstered their attack, instead spending £100m on the Atlético Madrid midfielder Rodri and the Juventus full-back João Cancelo. The club signed Scott Carson on loan from Derby on deadline day as a new third-choice goalkeeper, and bought back the left-back Angeliño from PSV Eindhoven.
