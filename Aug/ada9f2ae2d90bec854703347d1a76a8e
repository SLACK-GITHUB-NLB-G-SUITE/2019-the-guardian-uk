Tyson Fury will take on Otto Wallin, an unheralded Swede, in Las Vegas on 14 September as he inches closer to a rematch with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. Fury, the former IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion, made his debut in Vegas earlier this year when he blew away the overmatched Tom Schwarz inside two rounds. Wallin, like Fury, is unbeaten in his professional career but this fight represents a significant step-up in quality for the 6ft 5in southpaw. “I am pleased to be back in Las Vegas. I loved my time there in my last fight and am going to put on a show again,” Fury said. “Otto Wallin is a world-ranked fighter and is tall, something we want with the Deontay Wilder rematch around the corner. He is also a southpaw, which will bring its own obstacles, but I will be fully focused to get this job done because the rematch needs to happen.” This will be Fury’s second bout in a lucrative deal with American broadcasters ESPN, which he agreed a couple of months after a controversial draw against Wilder in Los Angeles last December. Wilder flattened Dominic Breazeale in the first round in May and is set for a rematch against Luis Ortiz later this year, although a venue has yet to be decided for that contest. Fury is eager to sort out a return date with Wilder but 28-year-old Wallin is hoping to derail those plans, saying: “This is the type of fight I’ve been waiting for since I was a kid and my father started showing me some boxing moves in our kitchen. I’ve made a lot of sacrifices to get to this point and I’m very happy it’s starting to pay off. “I know I’m an underdog in this fight, but I’m ready for this opportunity and I’m going to grab it with both hands. Anybody can get beat and especially in the heavyweight division. I like the fact that I have everything to gain and Tyson has everything to lose.”
