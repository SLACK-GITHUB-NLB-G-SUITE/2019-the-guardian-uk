Since then they have been worn for hundreds of miles of walks and thousands of miles of cycling. I have kept the label for posterity’s sake: “St Michael, Nylon S-T-R-E-T-C-H, warm wash, drip dry, warm iron” and perhaps the best bit (no ship miles) “Made in Great Britain”.Phyll HardieNorwich • Keith Flett (Letters, 1 August) has had a slight breakdown in his geography.
