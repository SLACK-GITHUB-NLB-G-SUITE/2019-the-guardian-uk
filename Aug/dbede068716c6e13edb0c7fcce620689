Plant this If you need a “good doer” for a white border, wildlife garden or cut-flower patch, take a look at easygoing perennial Achillea ptarmica ‘The Pearl’ – AKA sneezewort. It does well in sun or partial shade, producing sprays of tiny white flowers all summer long. Height and spread: 70cm x 70cm. Sow this Parsley is biennial, meaning it needs sowing twice a year to ensure a constant supply. Sow now for an overwintered crop under a cloche or cold frame. Seeds don’t transfer well, so sow in situ in pots or into a prepared seed-bed. Even easier, let existing plants self-seed and find their own sweet spot.
