Everton have completed the signing of Moise Kean from Juventus for an initial €32m (£29m). The Italy forward could end up costing €40m (£37m) with add-ons. The 19-year-old is Everton’s fifth summer signing and a second in quick succession after Jean Philippe-Gbamin’s arrival from Mainz on Friday night. Philippe-Gbamin is a replacement for Idrissa Gueye, who has joined Paris Saint-Germain for the same amount as Everton have paid for Kean. “I was convinced to sign because Everton is a club looking to the future and so am I,” said Kean. “I know about the size of the club. It has big ambition and I will work very hard to help us fulfil what we want to achieve. I am used to winning and I want to bring this winning attitude to the team. I hope I will be very good on the field and bring the fans joy.” Kean, who had one year remaining on his contract, scored six Serie A goals in 13 appearances last season and has played three times for Italy. Everton’s other summer purchases have been Jonas Lössl, André Gomes and Fabian Delph. “A striker was one of our priority signings this summer,” said Everton’s manager, Marco Silva. “Moise is strong, fast, with many good qualities as a striker and he is just 19 years old. He has talent and he is ready to work, ready to improve our squad and gives us different solutions.” Juventus remain in talks with Manchester City over selling the full-back João Cancelo in a transfer which could take Danilo in the opposite direction. They are also discussing a possible swap with Manchester United involving Paulo Dybala and Romelu Lukaku.
