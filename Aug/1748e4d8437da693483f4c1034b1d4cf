Worn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy. It may also be the item of clothing they wear the least. With sustainability taking centre stage, something about the practice of spending big on a labour-intensive dress that is worn only once doesn’t quite stack up, which is perhaps why many women are choosing to do things a little differently. We want to hear from those of you who have repurposed your wedding dresses to squeeze use out of them long after the honeymoon is over. Or, if you’ve bought a wedding dress that can easily be worn again as it is. Have you shortened your dress’ hemline enough to make it a casual day outfit, added embroidery or chopped off frills? Perhaps you’ve tie-dyed it? Or did you opt for a navy floral dress that you knew would be great for future job interviews or nights out? Share photos of yourself in the dress on your wedding day, and again when you’re wearing it in different occasions. One of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further.
