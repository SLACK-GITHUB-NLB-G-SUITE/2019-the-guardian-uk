Donald Trump’s former press secretary Sean Spicer will join the cast of Dancing with the Stars this September. The US spin on Strictly Come Dancing will see the controversial ex-staffer paired with a professional dancer despite him admitting that he was once told he has “the sense of beat of a steamroller”. During the reveal on Good Morning America, host Tom Bergeron joked that he would be in charge of assessing audience size. Spicer has since tweeted: “It’s time to have some fun. Excited to join a great cast and show.” When asked in 2018 if he would appear on the show he said: “It’s no. Zero on the rhythm. I wouldn’t do that to viewers.” Other cast members this season include Dawson’s Creek actor James Van Der Beek, Queer Eye culture expert Karamo Brown, the former basketball player Lamar Odom and the model Christie Brinkley. During Spicer’s tenure in the White House, he came under fire for a number of misleading statements, including the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. He was also criticised for claiming that Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons against the German people. After he resigned in July 2017, he made a cameo at the Emmy awards and wrote a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President in which he referred to Trump as “unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow”. Spicer follows in the post-White House reality show footsteps of fellow Trump staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother after working for the president.
