Boris Johnson advocating an easing of the visa regime in order to attract “top scientists” to Britain misses the point somewhat (Johnson eases UK immigration restrictions for top scientists, 9 August). Of course, any efforts to increase the appeal of Britain as a working environment for the sciences is very welcome. However, to attract the world science community to our shores does not begin or end with easier visas for the already established, welcome as they are. The real story begins many years before when young students and postgraduates are being developed in our universities and laboratories.The ease or difficulty of studying and commencing a career in Britain is what will determine whether they develop those links that will bring them here to stay. I am reminded of the slogan on car stickers in the 1980s in an era of cuts in education: “If you think education is expensive, try ignorance!”Sarah SheilsYork • It’s strange for Boris Johnson to choose Culham as the national scientific facility to demonstrate the UK’s strength as a scientific nation free from European bureaucracy. The principal research facility at Culham is called JET: the Joint European Torus, a circular fusion research reactor which started off as a fully EU-supported project in the 1970s and is now substantially supported by the Eurofusion research consortium. Under Brexit, it’s not clear how JET’s funding will be guaranteed.Professor Norman DombeyUniversity of Sussex • I’m fascinated by the government’s plan to “turbo-charge” no-deal Brexit plans. My car has a turbo-charger which works by blowing hot air into the engine. Is their policy based on the same principle?Robin JoyCanterbury, Kent
