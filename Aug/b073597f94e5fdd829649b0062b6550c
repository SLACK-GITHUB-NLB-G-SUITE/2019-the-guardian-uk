In Britain, we over-apologise out of politeness. That not only detracts from an apology when we do have something to be sorry for, but it can be seen as submission, especially in our professional lives. The classic example is at a social gathering or networking event. If you try to infiltrate a group by saying, “sorry to interrupt”, the first thing you have told people who do not know you is that you are apologetic and interrupting, which are not positive traits. Likewise, people responding to emails with “sorry for the delay in getting back to you” are alerting the recipient to the fact there was a delay. Instead, start by thanking the person for allowing you the time to come back to them. In terms of saying sorry when you have something to apologise for, it is better to do it succinctly: you can tell a sincere apology by the fact that it is short and to the point. Qualifying an apology generally means the apologiser does not fully mean it. Preferably, the apology should be face to face; if that is not possible, then do it over the phone. If you have really annoyed someone and done the initial apology face-to-face or over the phone, it is fine to follow up with something more expansive in writing. You have to know your audience. Flowers might not always work if your apology is to a blokey man, but it is always good to add something tangible and thoughtful to your words.
