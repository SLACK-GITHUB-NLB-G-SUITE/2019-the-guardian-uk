Manchester United have agreed an £80m deal to buy Harry Maguire from Leicester City, making the England international the world’s most expensive defender. Leicester wanted more for Maguire than the £75m Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk and the transfer will go through subject to a medical. Maguire had also been a target for Manchester City, who were understood to be his preferred destination, but the Premier League champions were unwilling to match the asking price. The need for United to conclude a deal for the 26-year-old increased when Eric Bailly was ruled out for four to five months with a knee injury. Maguire asked Leicester to leave and has agreed a five-year contract. He is in line to become Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s third summer signing, after the winger Daniel James and right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Leicester have made a substantial profit on Maguire, whom they signed from Hull in 2017 for an initial £12m, rising to a possible £17m.
