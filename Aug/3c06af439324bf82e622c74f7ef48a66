This week’s column is not for the fainthearted, or if you are super sensitive to smell. But if you are looking for a chemical- or manure-free fertiliser then, please, read on. We start with a hazard warning. It really will smell. A lot. Your garden neighbours will notice. They may disapprove. First, you will need a container with a tight lid. A plastic barrel with a screw top is best. Ours once held mango chutney. Keep it far from gardening friends. We use two plant varieties as the base: comfrey, our preference, and nettles. With comfrey, you might wait until before or after flowering as bees and other insects love them. We make around three preparations a season. It couldn’t be more simple. Cut armfuls of comfrey and/or nettles. Pack them in a barrel. Fill with water until near the top. Remember to tightly screw on the lid. And wait. After a few weeks, you will be happily gardening, but will be distracted by an oddly pervasive odour. When you lift the lid, you may see a crust, with white, worm-like funghi. Your brew is ready. Be prepared for the stink (though you likely won’t be). I’d advise long and strong rubberised gloves. You’ll also need a jug. Pour your brew into a watering can. We vary from a ratio of around 20-1 to around 10 (sometimes stronger), depending on potency and impatience. Top up slowly with water. It may bubble like honeycomb. Apply liberally to the soil late in the day or your neighbours may complain. We give stronger doses to squashes than leaf crops. We also water it in. Take care not to spill on your clothes. Your ‘herbal tea’ will give your growing a boost, help replenish plants. Lastly, pick late sweet peas or night-scented phlox or stocks. Breathe them in.
