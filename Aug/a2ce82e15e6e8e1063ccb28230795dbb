Olympiacos look set to reach the Champions League group stage after they beat Russian side Krasnodar 4-0. Miguel Ángel Guerrero opened the scoring, while Lazar Randelovic netted twice and Daniel Podence got the other to put the Greek side on the verge of progression after a year spent in the Europa League. Dinamo Zagreb are right on track to make a first return to the group stage since 2016-17 following their 2-0 first-leg play-off win over Rosenborg. Bruno Petkovic put them ahead in the eighth minute from the penalty spot and then 20 minutes later Mislav Orvic doubled the lead. Barring any capitulation in Norway next week, the Croatian side will return to the European’s elite competition after two seasons away. Red Star Belgrade’s hopes of a return to the group stage hang in the balance after a draw at Young Boys. The Serbian side, who beat champions Liverpool 2-0 in last season’s pool stage, saw a lead cancelled out late on to draw 2-2. Roger Assale gave the Swiss side a perfect start in just the seventh minute before Milos Degenek and Mateo García turned it around for Red Star. But Guillaume Hoarau’s penalty levelled for Young Boys, meaning it is all to play for in next week’s second leg in the Serbian capital.
