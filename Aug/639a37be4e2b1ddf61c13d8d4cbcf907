Love thy neighbour – or so the commandment goes. But what if the people next door to you blast Bon Jovi at your walls all day and night? A man in Cornwall has received complaints from neighbours in his housing block who are tired of him commanding his Alexa speaker to say “play Bon Jovi” again and again. What are the funniest or annoying noises you have heard from your neighbours? Tell us about the sounds you have heard coming from next door. Do you have an overzealous neighbour who likes to sing in the shower? Perhaps you live next to a DIY enthusiast who works regardless of the time. Did you speak to you neighbour about the noise? If so, how did they react? You can share your stories in the form below. We will include some of your submissions in our journalism. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
