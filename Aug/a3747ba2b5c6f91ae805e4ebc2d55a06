My friend and I have been close for 25 years. He has same-sex male pornographic images prominently displayed on the walls of his apartment – even in the bathroom and the kitchen. He allows only three friends to visit him. I am one of them. I have regularly tried to persuade him to get rid of them. He did take them down 10 years ago, but only for a few months. He has even updated them since. I believe that if he can bring himself to take them down for good, it will be liberating for him. But I am at my wit’s end  as to how to get him to do it. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
