The UK has a wonderfully varied roster of hills and mountains to summit, almost all of which can be reached without specialist climbing equipment. Many are remote while some have become so well trodden that it’s a round-the-clock effort to maintain the paths. Please tell us about interesting, less well known routes you’ve taken, and peaks that don’t attract a lot of walkers. Share details of your experiences, including navigation hints, great views, places to replenish lost calories and wildlife encounters. Even popular mountains such as Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Pen-y-Fan have a variety of routes up and longer, exciting hikes attached. Some can be reached by public transport; for others a car will be needed – please supply details of how to reach the start of the walk. In Scotland, some wild camping is allowed, so feel free to include details of locations. Otherwise, tell us about well placed B&Bs and campsites if you like. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
