Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We live in a terraced house and the neighbours’ two yapping dogs are driving us mad. We’ve politely mentioned it, but it just goes on and on. It’s so bad that my wife is thinking of putting our home on the market. What can we do before taking this drastic step? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
