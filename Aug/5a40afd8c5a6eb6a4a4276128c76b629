Is there a more singular style in comedy than Dr Brown’s? The shows in which he’s had a hand – his own, culminating in the 2012 Edinburgh comedy award; those of Natalie Palamides; and now Gutterplum by Courtney Pauroso – are instantly identifiable by their clownish naivety, sexual frankness and a borderline aggressive sense of play. Had its predecessors not existed, Pauroso’s debut might be the talk of this year’s festival. But the bar for outre carnal clowning was raised high by Palamides’ 2018 show Nate, and Pauroso doesn’t quite vault it. She gives it a good go, though: this is a show you won’t easily forget, particularly if you’re selected as her stooge. Gutterplum introduces us to Dale Ravioli, a gawky tomboy showing us what she can do with an exercise ball. A punter is summoned to join in – and thus begins an hour-long/lifelong relationship leading us from smouldering sex (well, a piggyback), via loneliness and the rekindling of love, all the way to old age and death. I was reminded of a sketch from Pappy’s immortal Last Show Ever that compressed a lifetime’s romance into two antic minutes. Pauroso’s show packs a similar emotional charge, even as, moment to moment – whether she’s doing sexy pushups, miming a drive to the abortion clinic, or playing air guitar on a pubic wig – it never stops being ridiculous. She effects the transformations from one life stage to the next with vivacity or subtlety as required. I wish she’d had a more willing audience stooge when I attended: his toe-curling reluctance threatened to eclipse the comedy. But there’s no mistaking this as another strikingly in-yer-face show from Dr Brown’s sexy-clown stable. At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August.
