Andy Murray and brother Jamie have fallen at the quarter-final stage of the Citi Open in Washington to Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus. The British pair took the first set of the clash on a tie-break, but lost the second in similar fashion as all 24 games followed serve. Klaasen and Venus were seeded third in the tournament and showed why in the deciding tie-break, breaking the Murrays’ serve to open up a 3-0 lead. Undeterred, the brothers bounced back to take a 7-5 lead, but the South African and New Zealander won five points in a row to prevail 6-7 (3), 7-6 (6), 10-7. Meanwhile, Kyle Edmund also tumbled out in Washington at the hands of German lucky loser Peter Gojowczyk. The 24-year-old’s disappointing summer continued with a three-set defeat in the quarter-finals, going down 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 to his opponent, ranked 122 in the world. Gojowczyk wrapped up the first set in 32 minutes but Edmund drew the match level. A solitary break in the third gave the 30-year-old the upper hand, as Edmund went on to save four match points but netted the fifth. Third seed Daniil Medvedev saw off Marin Cilic 6-4, 7-6 (7) and will now face Gojowczyk. Top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas cruised into the semi-finals with a 7-5, 6-0 win over Benoît Paire. After Paire showed the form that has brought him two titles this season in the early going, Tsitsipas won eight consecutive points to take the first set, before utterly dominating the second in which Paire seemed to be thrown off his rhythm by a delay caused by Tsitsipas’ shoelaces breaking. Tsitsipas, yet to drop a set this week, will now face his doubles partner Nick Kyrgios, who beat Slovakian lucky loser Norbert Gombos 6-3, 6-3. It is the Australian’s first ATP Tour semi-final since he took the title in Acapulco in March.
