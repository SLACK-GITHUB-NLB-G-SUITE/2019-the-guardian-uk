Rangers fans who invaded the pitch celebrating a late winning goal allegedly destroyed the roof covering disabled fans, injuring one man. A pitch invasion from the away fans followed Connor Goldson’s 91st-minute header that secured a 2-1 victory for Rangers at Kilmarnock. TV footage appeared to show three fans climbing on to the disabled fans’ shelter, which collapsed as fans jumped up and down following the winning goal. Police Scotland said four men were arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace, while one man was injured and needed treatment following the collapse of the roof. A spokeswoman for the force said: “An investigation is under way following a pitch incursion. The incident resulted in the roof of a shelter collapsing and one man being injured. He received medical treatment at the ground and our inquiries are ongoing. Four men were arrested in connection with breaching the peace.” Kilmarnock are also investigating after witnesses reported Rangers fans being “crushed” trying to get into Rugby Park because of problems at the turnstiles. The away end was only approximately three-quarters full at kick-off but, by the dramatic conclusion of the game, Rangers fans could be seen sitting and standing on the stadium’s stairs and entrances to terraces. The game was settled when Goldson pounced in the final seconds to snatch the points. Scott Arfield prodded Rangers ahead in the 16th minute but in a repeat of last season’s struggles they paid the price for failing to build on their lead and were pegged back by Stephen O’Donnell’s strike with eight minutes left.
