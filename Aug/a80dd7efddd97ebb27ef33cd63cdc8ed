More than a million people are expected at Notting Hill carnival in west London over the bank holiday weekend. Sunday is family day, when performances are predominantly for the entertainment and involvement of children. Thousands of glittering, feathery costumes in a spectrum of vibrant colours are on display. Many groups have their own themes and stories to tell with their outfits, but everyone is dressed to impress. The carnival has taken place since 1966 and is a celebration of Caribbean heritage, culture and traditions. More than 70 groups of musicians and performers will play their part over the weekend. There is a broad spectrum of music to suit all tastes from salsa to reggae and from Afrobeat to funky house. The sound of vuvuzelas and car horns adds to the carnival atmosphere.
