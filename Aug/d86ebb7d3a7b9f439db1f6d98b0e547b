England batsman Jason Roy has passed a concussion test after being hit in the nets before the third Ashes Test at Headingley. The 29-year-old was struck by a throw-down from former England opening batsman Marcus Trescothick, who is working with the team in a temporary capacity, during practice on Tuesday. Roy was assessed after impact and was able to continue batting, but also required a follow-up check on the eve of the Test to determine any delayed symptoms. The Surrey opener will undergo a further check on the morning of the match, the England and Wales Cricket Board indicated, but is now expected to take his place at the top of the innings. The issue of head injuries has become a major talking point in the series after Australia’s Steve Smith was struck in the neck by a 92mph bouncer from Jofra Archer at Lord’s. He was diagnosed with delayed onset concussion, becoming the first Test cricketer to be substituted for concussion, and has also been ruled out of this week’s Test. Roy was not the only player to be hit on the helmet on Tuesday as both sides build their readiness against the short ball, with Marnus Labuschagne – Smith’s replacement in the last Test – struck by teammate Mitchell Marsh.
