North Korea has fired additional unidentified short-range projectiles, the South Korean news agency Yonhap has reported, citing the country’s military as a source. The launches, the third round of missile launches in a week, were fired off separately from North Korea’s eastern coast early on Friday, South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff told Yonhap. The nuclear-armed North described an earlier missile launch as a warning to the South over planned joint military drills with the US. The projectiles were fired in the pre-dawn hours from Yonghung, South Hamgyong province, into the East Sea, the JCS told Yonhap. The nuclear-armed North is banned from ballistic missile launches under UN security council resolutions. There was no immediate comment from Pyongyang on the latest launches.
