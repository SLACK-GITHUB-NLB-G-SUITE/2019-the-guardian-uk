Tim Etchells is surely a master of the late-night pub conversation. Give him a thought experiment and watch him go. Here, in this hypnotic Forced Entertainment monologue, he plays with the question of what we would do if we could travel back in time. It is a game many of us have played – like imagining what we would do if we won the lottery – but few have pursued it with such dogged logic. It’s performed by a measured and unflappable Tyrone Huggins with a mixture of innocent inquiry and concern about the implications of his own thought processes. He starts, as many a pub conversation would, with the small changes he would make to prevent mistakes, accidents and disasters. If he could go back in time, he would visit scenes of historical importance or insert himself Zelig-like in to the background of famous photographs. Or maybe he would use the benefit of hindsight to make himself rich with a canny investment. You have probably had such daydreams yourself and, most likely, entertained the sci-fi paradoxes of becoming your own parent or triggering the butterfly effect by making a tiny change that had major consequences. But the deeper Etchells goes into this material, the more it becomes an existential meditation. Whether he is imagining righting the wrongs of the past or returning with news of an apocalyptic future, the playwright is repeatedly pulled back to the present. Our regrets can range from failing to save a computer document to allowing the rise of Hitler, but like it or not, we can only exist in the moment. Asking “what if?” is fun, but “what now?” is the truly productive question. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 August. • Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.
