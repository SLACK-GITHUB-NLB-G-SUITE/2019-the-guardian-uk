The British actor and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge is to host Saturday Night Live alongside musical guest Taylor Swift. The creator of Killing Eve and Fleabag will guest host the late-night American sketch show on 5 October. She will be joined by Swift, the multiple Grammy winner who is in the spotlight again after releasing her seventh album, Lover. Waller-Bridge honed her comedy skills at the Edinburgh fringe, where her one-woman show – the inspiration for Fleabag – found critical acclaim. The 34-year-old is currently working on a Fleabag book as well as on the upcoming James Bond film, titled No Time to Die. Other presenters announced for this season include the actor Woody Harrelson, in his fourth turn as SNL host. He will be joined by musical guest Billie Eilish on 28 September. The Stranger Things star David Harbour fronts the show on 12 October alongside Havana hit-maker Camila Cabello. Kristen Stewart will return for a second time as host on 2 November, alongside an unconfirmed musical guest. On 21 December, Eddie Murphy will appear for the first time since his lengthy and career-defining 1984 stint – bar a brief turn on SNL’s 40th anniversary special in 2015. Alec Baldwin and Robert De Niro featured heavily in SNL’s last series – regularly taking aim at Donald Trump as well as the Democrats.
