The Colorado Rapids have announced Saturday’s match with the Montreal Impact will go ahead as scheduled, but parking at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park will be restricted to asphalt lots and a planned fireworks display has been canceled due to plague-infested fleas found on prairie dog colonies in the area. Plague has been confirmed in prairie dogs at several sites in the Denver suburb of Commerce City, prompting officials to close some parks and take other precautions. The Tri-County Health Department said Thursday prairie dog burrows are being sprayed with insecticide to kill fleas that could transmit the disease to the rodents, people and pets. “Our highest priority is the health and safety of our fans, staff, and local community,” the Rapids said in a statement. The health department says Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and Prairie Gateway Open Space are temporarily closed. Tri-County Health Director Dr John M Douglas Jr says plague is common in Colorado prairie dog colonies and can be managed safely with insecticides. The Rapids are bottom of the Western Conference table with 20 points from 22 matches and haven’t won a match since June, a winless run that includes a 3-0 friendly defeat to Arsenal at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park last month.
