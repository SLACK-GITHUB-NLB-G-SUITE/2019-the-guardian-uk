Recognition from a fellow sufferer – someone else who feels Ludovico Einaudi is the musical equivalent of watching paint dry (G2, 2 August).Grazina McCarthyLondon • Fiona Sturges refers to Sean Henry’s sculpture off Newbiggin-by-the-Sea looking out to sea and the “watery sunset” (Will public art recover from Tina Turner’s giant head?, Journal, 3 August). “Sunrise”, I think, when looking out over the North Sea.Donald ChrostonSunderland, Tyne and Wear • Good to see another Covent Garden ballet picture (Eyewitness, 5 August).
