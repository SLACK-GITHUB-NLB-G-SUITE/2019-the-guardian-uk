Mick Schumacher took his first win in Formula Two at the Hungaroring after a tense race with Japan’s Nobuharu Matsushita. Schumacher is attempting to follow his father Michael and make it to F1 and the victory is another step towards achieving his goal. Schumacher Sr, who won seven world championships, is still recovering from the skiing accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury in 2013. He was very successful at the Hungaroring with four wins and his son was pleased to have made his mark in Hungary. “It is very special,” he said. “And also thinking back to last year when I won for the first time in Spa, where my dad was also very comfortable.” The 20-year-old started from pole in the reverse-grid sprint race. He led from the off and, despite a strong challenge from Matsushita, took the flag with a 1.4sec advantage. Schumacher is a member of the Ferrari driver academy and is intent on reaching F1. He is highly rated by his Prema team but is likely to spend at least another season in F2. He is 11th in the championship as he comes to terms with the formula he entered for the first time this year. In F3 he spent one season making the step up and in his second year went on to dominate, winning the title last year. “Having the first victory in F2 is a great thing,” he said. “I need to work a lot on myself. Whether I go to F1 next year or in two years or maybe three, I don’t know. “I will do my best possible, try to learn as much as possible so that when I make the step I will be ready and able to feel comfortable.”
