A man watching a bull run at a festival in central Spain has died after being gored by one of the animals. The incident occurred on Thursday during a bull run in the town of Cuéllar. A 62-year-old man received “several deadly horn blows” to the chest and neck and nothing could be done to save him, the town mayor, Carlos Fraile, told local media. The man was a spectator at the festival and did not run in front of the animal when the bulls were released but was pushed into a field and gored. Spain is renowned for its bull runs, which are held across the country in the summer months. The most famous takes place during the San Fermín festival in Pamplona, northern Spain, where hundreds of people come from across the world to run at their own risk in front of bulls through the city’s streets. Eight people were gored and 35 were injured at this year’s Pamplona festival. At least 16 people have been killed in bull runs since records started in 1911.
