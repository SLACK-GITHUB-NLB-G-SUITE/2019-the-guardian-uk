American teenager Amanda Anisimova withdrew from the US Open on Tuesday because of the recent death of her father and coach, Konstantin. A statement from family members, released by Anisimova’s representatives, said: “We are shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our father. We appreciate the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time and ask that you respect our privacy.” The US Tennis Association announced that Anisimova had pulled out of the year’s last grand slam tournament, where main-draw play begins Monday. Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey to Russian parents and moved to Florida when she was three, is currently ranked 24th and would have been seeded for the US Open. She is an up-and-coming star in women’s tennis who reached the semi-finals at the French Open in June aged 17. Anisimova upset defending champion Simona Halep in the quarterfinals at Roland Garros, before losing to eventual champion Ash Barty in three sets. Her first WTA title came in April at Bogota, Colombia. As a junior, Anisimova won the 2017 US Open girls’ title, beating Coco Gauff in the final.
