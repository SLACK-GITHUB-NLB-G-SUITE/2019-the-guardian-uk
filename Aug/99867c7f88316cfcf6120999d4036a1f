Apropos men who take their wives’ surnames (’My fiancee’s name was so much cooler than mine’, G2, 20 August), I’m two years younger than my wife. When we got married, she told me that she intended to keep her surname, on the grounds that she’d had her name longer than I’d had mine.

Our poor kids and teachers – the only ones in Europe to be stuck in school throughout the best weather of the summer.Tessa GeorgeLewes, East Sussex • If “rules help control the fun” (Perfect pairs: the long and short of socks, G2, 21 August) then I have another: never wear matching socks. Choose ones that differ unnoticeably, or go for outrageous dissonance – now that is fun.Tom JonesBirmingham • I have a modest proposal: build the HS2 lines north of Birmingham first (HS2 could be scrapped as critic gets role in independent review, 21 August).
