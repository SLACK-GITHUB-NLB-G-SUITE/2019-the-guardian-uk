Mario Balotelli is set to join Brescia on a three-year deal after turning down an offer from Flamengo in Brazil. The 29-year-old left Marseille in the summer and has been discussing a deal with Brescia for some time now. There was an offer from Flamengo but the former Italy international is now close to agreeing a deal that will take him back to Serie A for the first time since the 2015-16 season, when he played for Milan. Balotelli, who has 36 caps for Italy and played for Manchester City between 2010 and 2013, was discussing the final details of the deal with Brescia on Wednesday and is expected to join before the weekend. Brescia were promoted from Serie B last season after winning the division one point before Lecce. The striker scored eight goals in 12 league appearances for Marseille after joining in January. He was born in Palermo but spent a large part of his childhood in Brescia and has always said that he only feels at home in that city.
