The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is said to be drawing up plans for millions of 50p Brexit coins to be minted in time for Britain’s departure from the EU. Javid has asked officials to look at whether it will be possible to produce the coins in volume ready for the UK’s scheduled EU leaving date of 31 October, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The previous chancellor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for £10 each. Javid’s proposal for the coins to be produced for mass circulation was being portrayed as a statement of intent that the Treasury is fully behind Brexit. It is in marked contrast to Hammond who infuriated Brexiteers with his warning about the likely economic impact of leaving the EU and his opposition to a no-deal break. The coins would carry the words “Friendship with all nations” and be stamped with the departure date of 31 October 2019. The Telegraph reported one possible snag could be that the coin would have to be signed off by a meeting of the Queen’s privy council of ministers, which is not due to meet again until October.
