Colombia’s Miguel Ángel López led home the Astana team to secure the first red jersey of the Vuelta a España in a dramatic opening team time trial. There was disappointment for Jumbo-Visma as five riders from the eight-man team came off their bikes after encountering a patch of water on the road. The team regrouped to limit their deficit to 40 seconds at the end of the 13.4km race against the clock. However, Lopez set the standard as five Astana riders came home in a time of 14min 51sec. Deceuninck-QuickStep were second, with Sunweb third.
