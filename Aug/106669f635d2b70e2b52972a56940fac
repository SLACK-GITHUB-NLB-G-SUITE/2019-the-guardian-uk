Mahmood al-Zarooni is seeking a pardon from the British Horseracing Authority and wants to train again, despite having been the subject of a worldwide eight-year ban for giving anabolic steroids to racehorses. “The past six years have been very tough on me and my family,” he has told the Daily Mirror. “I would be grateful to the BHA if they grant me a pardon.” The Dubaian became one of the most infamous figures in the history of racing in 2013 when found to have doped 15 horses with stanozolol or ethylestranol. A further seven horses in his care tested positive shortly afterwards, including the St Leger winner, Encke. “I made a mistake but quickly realised the cost of using steroids,” Zarooni now says. “Eight years banned is a harsh punishment and a life changer. Now I’m a different person and I’ll train horses in a different way. I’ll stick to the rules and obey the regulations. It will be great to get a second chance.” But there is no indication from the BHA that any second chance will be forthcoming. A pardon seems most unlikely, in view of the gravity of his case, and Zarooni would surely face an uphill struggle if he ever again sought a licence to train in Britain, when he would have to convince the BHA’s licensing committee that he was a fit and proper person. His ban ends in two years. He has told the Mirror that he had “no plan to cheat” when causing the steroids to be administered. He did so, he claims, “for therapeutic reasons” at a time when there was no immediate plan for the horses to race. However, there is no explanation offered as to what therapy could justify the administration of anabolic steroids to so many animals. Guardian readers will recall that Zarooni instructed solicitors three years ago in the hope of getting his ban reduced, but those efforts evidently came to nothing. The interesting one at a price today is Dixieland (2.50), a 20-1 shot for a sprint handicap at Thirsk. This three-year-old showed some promise with Richard Hannon last year, without actually managing to win anything. Sent off at huge prices under a claimer, he showed nothing in his first two starts for Marjorie Fife last month. But he’s been dropped 10lb for those runs and Danny Tudhope now climbs aboard. Fife has been short of winners this year but had one on Tuesday and this might not be a bad time to take an interest. More obviously, Kwanza (2.10) can go in again for Mark Johnston in Musselburgh’s opener, in which rain-softened ground has prompted three non-runners. There was also some cut when this filly, who has four winning siblings, won at Pontefract three weeks ago and she’s evidently going the right way. She’s 2-1. An hour later, Orion’s Bow (3.10) is fairly priced and seemingly the subject of interest at 3-1. A Stewards’ Cup runner-up back in the day, he got his first win for three years on soft at Hamilton last month and this looks another good chance. The nap is Gendarme (3.30), who faces a small field at Brighton but is available at 3-1. From the in-form Alexandra Dunn yard, he escapes a penalty for scoring in an apprentice race at Epsom last week and Cieren Fallon rides again.
