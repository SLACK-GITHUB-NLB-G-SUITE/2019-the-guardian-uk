Strictly Come Dancing is “completely open” to having same-sex couples compete on the show in the future, the BBC has said. In previous years, the broadcaster said it had no plans to change the mixed-sex format, despite calls from several of the show’s stars. The BBC said it was open to the idea after a report in the Daily Mirror that same-sex pairings would be allowed from next year. A spokesman at the corporation said: “Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and we are proud to have featured same-sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series. “We are completely open to the prospect of including same-sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers in the future, should the opportunity arise.” The Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has supported the idea of same-sex couples, previously saying he thought it would happen “eventually”. “I think more and more people want it, the more it will happen,” he said. “I have no argument against it. I think it would be rather fun. Maybe the BBC will be brave enough one day to do it.” The rev Richard Coles, a previous contestant, said it made “no sense” that anyone would resist having same-sex couples taking to the floor together, while the Strictly professional dancer Kevin Clifton has said he would be happy to dance with another man on the show. Last year, the show included a dramatic same-sex dance, for what was thought to be the first time. The performance drew a positive reaction from fans, who were delighted to see the professionals dancing together outside of the usual male/female pattern.
