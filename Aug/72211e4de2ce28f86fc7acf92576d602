Contrary to the impression given by your coverage of the interpretation of the definition of harassment in disciplinary cases (Cambridge sexual misconduct rule change branded ‘unlawful’, theguardian.com, 31 July), the University of Cambridge will continue to investigate complaints of sexual misconduct for evidence of harassment. From 1 October, our disciplinary code will make specific provision for sexual misconduct and the standard of proof in all cases, including those involving sexual misconduct, will be changed from “beyond reasonable doubt” to the “balance of probabilities”. It does not follow, of course, that all complaints will necessarily lead to disciplinary proceedings being instigated, since this depends on sufficient evidence of sexual misconduct in any given case. Complaints of sexual misconduct arising before 1 October will continue to be dealt with under the existing rules, and all complaints of sexual misconduct will continue to be investigated for evidence of harassment. In practice, a substantial proportion of cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct will fall within the definition of harassment. If a finding of harassment is made the disciplinary committee has the full range of sanctions available to it. The university has been at the forefront of efforts within higher education to ensure that students feel protected and supported against all forms of harassment. We believe it is essential that students continue to come forward to report to us what has happened to them so they can get specialist support and advice on their options, whether that is an internal or external investigation. The university has a number of widely publicised safeguards in place – including dedicated guidance and support from a specialist sexual assault and harassment adviser and powers to intervene quickly to ensure the safety of students, including exclusion from the university.Graham VirgoSenior pro-vice-chancellor, University of Cambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
