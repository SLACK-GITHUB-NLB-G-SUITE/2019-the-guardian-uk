Bury’s League One fixture at home against Gillingham on Saturday has been suspended, the EFL has announced. The Shakers, deducted 12 points for entering into a company voluntary arrangement, have been issued with a notice of withdrawal of membership by the EFL and their first three games of the campaign have already been postponed. “The EFL board has suspended Bury FC’s fixture with Gillingham on Saturday 17 August 2019 as it has not received the outstanding evidence required by today’s 9am deadline. “The EFL has made it clear that it cannot continue suspending fixtures indefinitely and the deadline of 23 August for withdrawal of membership remains in place. However, the EFL remains committed to working with the club to try and find a successful conclusion.”
