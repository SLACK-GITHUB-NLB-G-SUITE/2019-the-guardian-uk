German authorities say they have seized 4.5 tonnes of cocaine, worth €1bn ($1.11 bn), in the northern port city of Hamburg, making it the country’s biggest haul to date. Hamburg’s customs office said it had examined a suspicious shipping container two weeks ago that came from the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, bound for the Belgian city of Antwerp. The container’s description said it was loaded with soybeans but authorities instead found 221 black sport bags containing 4,200 packets of pressed cocaine, the office said in a statement. “This enormous amount represents the largest single seizure of cocaine in Germany,” it said, adding the Hamburg prosecutor’s office was investigating the intended destination of the container. “The confiscated cocaine was destroyed under strict and extensive security measures,” it added.
