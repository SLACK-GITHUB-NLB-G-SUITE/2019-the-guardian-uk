You report that Channel 4 has announced a show called The British Tribe Next Door, “which will see Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt relocate her entire family to Namibia, where they will live alongside the semi-nomadic Himba people in a purpose-built replica of their County Durham semi-detached house” (22 August). Some previous Channel 4 shows have been described as “poverty porn”. Is there a suitable epithet for this one?Mike GautreyWokingham, Berkshire • My wife and I have been gripped by the Danish drama Below the Surface on BBC Four, in which a group of vulnerable individuals, including children, are held hostage in a shipping container. Imagine our surprise at finding the programme is in fact a documentary about UK social housing policy (Report, 21 August).John LovelockBristol • Thirty years ago my family of four survived with one metal bin for household waste (Letters, 26 August).
