I never liked motorcyclists much until, in the throes of a midlife crisis, I became one. I thought them noisy and angry. But it turned out they are invariably lovely people. There is so much enmity on the roads, but not among us. Did you know we always acknowledge each other when we pass? It’s so sweet; sometimes I can barely see for the moistening in my eyes. I first came across this on a long trip to see my mum in Croatia. On the continent, riding on the right, it turned out bikers use their left hands to make a low victory sign as they pass. At first I thought I was imagining it, but after a third biker did this, heading south towards Lille, I decided to lean into the love. As the next bike approached, I shot my left hand out with a big victory sign on it. However, in my enthusiasm, I’d stuck my arm too far out, and the wind my speed was generating nearly snapped it off. This rookie error behind me, I got the hang of it and saluted riders of many nations all the way to the Adriatic. I wondered if bikers at home were as friendly. On my next long ride here, now on the left of the road, obviously, I readied my low victory sign for its debut on home soil. At 60mph on the A44 in Oxfordshire, I nonchalantly showed it to an oncoming Honda. As I did so, the bike all but threw me off. Being a chump, I’d forgotten that signalling with the right hand meant releasing the throttle. Which is why we Brits nod instead of wave. I’ve ridden from London to Anglesey and back this week, and nodded so much my neck hurts. It’s a beautiful pain. • Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist
