I have been with my husband for 32 years and thought our marriage was happy and solid. Ten weeks ago, a woman contacted me and said she was in a relationship with him. He had told her we had separated. I am heartbroken, as are our adult daughters. I now know adultery has been a way of life for him for 25 years. He says he has always loved me and does now more than ever. I still love him and am terrified of walking away. He believes he is a sex addict and is seeing a therapist (but not one who specifically works with sex addiction). Is this something he could recover from? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
