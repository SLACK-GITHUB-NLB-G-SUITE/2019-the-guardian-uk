Mako Vunipola, whose injury was the sole blight on England’s record 57-15 demolition of Ireland at Twickenham, has a small tear of scar tissue in his hamstring that will need 10 days of rehabilitation to heal, meaning he will miss the final warm-up game before the World Cup. His likely recovery for the World Cup will be a huge relief for Eddie Jones as his England squad fly out to Treviso to continue their preparations for the tournament in Japan next month with a final warm-up match, against Italy on 6 September at St James’ Park. Ben Moon has been called up to Jones’s squad as a temporary replacement for Vunipola, who needed surgery to reattach tendons after tearing his hamstring for Saracens in May. Vunipola’s prognosis may be welcomed by the England camp but Jack Nowell’s chances of playing in Japan are “touch and go”, according to his club coach, Rob Baxter. The 26-year-old wing injured his ankle in Exeter’s Premiership final defeat by Saracens in June, but was included in England’s 31-man squad. “I think he’s going to be touch and go for involvement in the World Cup,” Baxter told BBC Radio Devon. “But let’s cross our fingers and hope that he can come through.” After facing Italy, England fly to Japan on 8 September. They begin their campaign against Tonga on Sunday 22 September. New Zealand have named their World Cup squad without the Northampton prop Owen Franks. The tighthead, who has played 108 Tests for the All Blacks, is replaced in the front row by the 24-year-old Atu Moli of the Waikato Chiefs. Also failing to survive Steve Hansen’s cut is the powerful centre Ngani Laumape, with Anton Lienert‑Brown, Sonny Bill Williams, Jack Goodhue and Ryan Crotty preferred. The defending champions New Zealand begin their tournament against South Africa in Yokahama on 21 September.
