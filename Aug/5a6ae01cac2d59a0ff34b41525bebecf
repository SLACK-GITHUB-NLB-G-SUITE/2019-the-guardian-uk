Sex trafficking is a big and serious subject. While it is good to see theatre raising the issue, Eugene O’Hare’s debut play doesn’t so much explore its ramifications as bob and weave on the margins. He writes well for actors, being one himself, but I learned as much about modern slavery from the leaflet in the programme as from the play itself. O’Hare shows an abducted 12-year-old Romanian girl, Mara, being deposited by a north London landlord on two of his misfit tenants. One, O’Rourke, is mentally fragile and in a permanent state of anger. The other, Beezer, is a dedicated boozer and failed meteorologist. O’Hare sets up the situation neatly and shows the landlord and his henchman euphemistically defending their dirty trade, but he seems unsure how to develop the action. We assume, though we are never explicitly told, that Mara is deployed in the sex trade. Since she speaks no English, the second half consists largely of a series of confessional monologues in which her minders treat her as the passive recipient of information about their own troubled pasts. Slavery, O’Hare implies, takes many forms. But given Mara’s terrible plight, why should we care about her unwilling captors? Alice Hamilton’s direction brings out strong echoes of Pinter in the fractious relationship between the two bed-sharing tenants. Alec Newman is plausibly volatile as O’Rourke and Mark Hadfield hints at the wasted intellect of the deadbeat Beezer. David Schaal as the Cypriot landlord and Cyril Nri as his yoyo-playing driver invest their roles with suitable menace but, although Niamh James is a poignant presence as the silent Mara, it is her story that you really long to hear told. At Park theatre, London, until 14 September.
