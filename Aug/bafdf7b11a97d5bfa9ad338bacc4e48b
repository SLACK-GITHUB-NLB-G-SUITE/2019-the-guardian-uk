However expected, Jane Dodds’ byelection victory in Brecon and Radnorshire is a nail in the coffin of the Johnson government. Let us hope that opposition parties and liberal-minded Tory MPs will use the summer wisely to forge a united front capable of derailing the Johnson juggernaut and frustrating Farage’s so negative purposes.Peter ChapmanAshwell, Hertfordshire • Hugh Muir did indeed raise some interesting issues about the honours system being rooted in empire (Letters, 2 August). My staunchly republican husband told our children that the MBE I received in 2002 for work with rough sleepers stood for My Bloody Effort. They fully understood why I didn’t get the OBE (Other Bugger’s Effort).Helen Keats MBERough sleeping adviser, Kingston, Isle of Wight • I learn from my local paper that Robin Walker “previously served as a minister in the Department for Exciting the European Union”. Could we hear more about this department so that we can all join in?Elizabeth DunnettMalvern, Worcestershire • Re Susan Seager’s comments on I Am Nicola (Letters, 30 July), I agree that Adam had serious vulnerabilities and issues that needed help.

I would have dropped him like a hot potato.Pam ConnellanGreat Shelford, Cambridgeshire • Peter C Stone (Letters, 2 August) suggests that the Rees-Moggs might still use a typewriter.
