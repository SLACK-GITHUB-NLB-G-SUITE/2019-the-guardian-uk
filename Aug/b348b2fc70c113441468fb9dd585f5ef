Next week is the last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader was in Springburn, Glasgow, as part of a three-day visit to Scotland. Asked about comments made by Keir Starmer about next week being the final opportunity to stop the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement, Corbyn said: “Yes, it is the last chance and we will do absolutely everything we can to prevent a no-deal Brexit and the prime minister taking us into the hands of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the USA. “That is the real agenda of the prime minister. There is a lot of work being done in preparation for next Tuesday.” His comments came as it was reported that Boris Johnson is expected to stop Conservative MPs standing at the next election if they vote to block a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister is expected to treat next week’s Commons votes as a no-confidence vote in his government, with rebel Conservatives to be disqualified from contesting their seats, the Sun reported. With parliament returning on Tuesday, Johnson is understood to be aiming to persuade some MPs not to rebel as he hopes to quell an attempt to introduce legislation through parliament to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. Protesters have taken to the streets across the country in response to Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament. Thousands of people gathered in George Square in the centre of Glasgow at a People’s Assembly Defend Democracy rally against the prorogation of parliament. Corbyn is expected to be among the speakers, marking the end of his three-day visit to Scotland.
