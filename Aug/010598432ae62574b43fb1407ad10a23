An obvious answer to the problem of predicted grades (Editorial, 17 August) has been raised before but does not seem to be seriously considered. That is: students go to university the year after their A-levels. This means they know their grades and have time to think about their possible course and preferred college. Depending on their circumstances they may work, carry out further study, travel. Whatever they do, the advantage to them and their future lecturers is that they have gained a year’s maturity after the break. Some who may have been reluctant anyway will certainly decide not to take up the option of university, but better that this is a choice rather than dropping out after a miserable first year feeling a failure. It should certainly stop some of them regarding university as a continuation of boarding school. Mature students are usually highly motivated; likewise students who choose university after a year’s break are likely to be confident they actually want to be there, rather than having done what is expected of them.Angela BartonBishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
