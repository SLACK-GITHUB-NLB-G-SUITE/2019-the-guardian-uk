A police force which posted a wanted drug dealer’s mugshot on Facebook has warned it could take action against abusive comments after his hairstyle was mocked online. The appeal for assistance by Gwent police in their search for Jermaine Taylor, 21, had garnered more than 89,000 comments by Monday after they posted the image last week. The response ranged from memes to one-liners such as: “Push his release date back further than his hair line, that should teach him.” Another poster said: “He was last seen in town; Police are combing the area.” However, other comments prompted Gwent police to issue a follow-up statement on Facebook telling users to remember that harassing, threatening and abusing people on social media could be against the law. The force added: “Our advice is to be as careful on social media as you would in any other form of communication. If you say something about someone which is grossly offensive or is of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, then you could be investigated by the police.” Taylor, from Newport, breached his licence conditions after being released from prison in December last year. He had received a three-year sentence at Cardiff crown court for supplying cocaine in September 2017. By Monday morning, the force was back on Facebook to thank everyone who had liked, commented and shared the post “and welcome to our new international followers.” Gwent police said: “We’re really grateful to everyone who is assisting us in locating Jermaine Taylor, and we must admit a few of these comments have made us laugh. “However, when the line is crossed from being funny to abusive, we do have to make sure we are responsible and remind people to be careful about what they write on social media.” Taylor is still being sought by Gwent police and members of the public have been urged to contact them with any information about his whereabouts.
