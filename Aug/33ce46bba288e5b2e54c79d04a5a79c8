Tesco is to cut 4,500 jobs at 153 high street Tesco Metro supermarkets,adding to the 9,000 the UK’s biggest retailer warned were at risk earlier this year. In a statement on its website, the supermarket chain said it had taken the decision as part of an effort to “simplify and reduce processes and administrative tasks” across all of its Metro stores. “The changes in our Metro stores will be focused on better tailoring them to how our customers shop,” it said. “The Metro format was originally designed for larger, weekly shops, but today nearly 70% of customers use them as convenience stores, buying food for that day.” It said it could cut staff because it had found simpler ways of stacking shelves that meant there was less need to store stock in backrooms, while it also wanted to simplify store management structures and introduce more flexible working hours. Tesco will also reduce opening hours in 134 of its 1,750 smaller neighbourhood Express stores, where footfall is lower. Jason Tarry, the supermarket’s UK and Ireland boss, said: “In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way. “We do not take any decision which impacts colleagues lightly, but have to make sure we remain relevant for customers and operate a sustainable business now and in the future.” The retailer, which has more than 300,000 UK employees and more than 3,400 stores, said earlier this year it could cut 9,000 jobs, although it hoped to redeploy up to half into other customer service roles. The cuts are part of plans by the chief executive, Dave Lewis, to slash £1.5bn from Tesco’s cost base in an effort to rebuild profits, which have never recovered from the 2014 accounting scandal. Fishmonger, butcher and baker jobs at the retailer were expected to be at risk, along with counter staff.
