Jürgen Klopp has said he expects to take a break from coaching to recharge his batteries when he leaves Liverpool. Klopp, who joined the club in 2015 and has a contract to 2022, told Germany’s Kicker magazine: “I have absolute energy. But I have one problem. I can’t do ‘a little bit’. I can only do ‘all or nothing’. When I decide that I cannot do it any longer then I will take a break for a year.” Klopp joined Liverpool after a successful time at Borussia Dortmund, where he won two league titles and a German Cup while also reaching the Champions League final in 2013. The 52-year-old, who had a short break between leaving Dortmund and being appointed by Liverpool in October 2015, said of his planned sabbatical: “After that year a decision must then be taken. But chances are very high that my energy level will then be there once more and that I can then do the job the way I want to.”
