Arsenal have been informed that they must pay around £70m to sign Dayot Upamecano from RB Leipzig as they step up attempts to recruit defensive reinforcements before Thursday’s transfer deadline. After completing the purchase of Nicolas Pépé from Lille last week for £72m, the France Under-21 international has been identified as the club’s preferred defensive target, although the Bundesliga side are understood to be reluctant to allow him to leave despite the fact he has only two years left on his contract. Reports in Germany have claimed that a €60m (£55m) offer was rejected by RB over the weekend, although it is believed that Arsenal have yet to submit an official bid for the 20-year-old central defender, who moved to Germany as a teenager in 2015 from Valenciennes having rejected an approach from Manchester United. There is also interest in the Juventus defender Daniele Rugani, with Arsenal exploring the possibility of signing the Italian initially on loan having been quoted around £50m to buy him outright. Laurent Koscielny, meanwhile, looks likely to leave the Emirates, with Bordeaux and Rennes both keen on the 33-year-old.
