We came up with this fantastic party sharer to celebrate Manchester Pride this weekend. It’s our take on a classic summer English spritz, using Earl Grey for its distinctive, crisp flavour. Infusing the gin like this is a simple way to add flavour at home and enhance its delicate, floral botanical characteristics. Add plenty of fresh fruit at the end. Serves 1 50ml Earl Grey-infused gin – simply put 1 Earl Grey teabag in a bottle of gin (we use Bombay Sapphire), leave for six hours, then remove20ml fresh lemon juice10ml standard 50:50 sugar syrup200ml tonic water – an aromatic one is best (we use Merchant’s Heart)2-3 slices strawberry, 1 orange twist and a few mint leaves, to garnish Put a big handful of ice in a tall glass, pour in the gin, lemon juice and syrup, and stir. Top with the tonic, garnish and serve. • Rosemarie Tucker, head bartender, The Refuge, Manchester
