Philadelphia Union captain Alejandro Bedoya brought attention to this weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas when he called out Congress after scoring for his team in Washington DC. The USA international scored his team’s opening goal in their 5-1 win over DC United on Sunday. After Bedoya scored he ran over to a TV microphone and shouted: “Hey Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let’s go!” The comment could be heard on Fox Sports’ coverage of the game. Philadelphia Union soccer player Alejandro Bedoya scores a goal in tonight's game against D.C.

America, it seems, is becoming a dystopian society.” When Bedoya was asked to clarify by another user on Twitter how he would address the problem of gun violence he expanded on his views. “We can start with stricter background checks, red flag laws, making a registry for gun purchases, closing gun show loopholes, and taxing ammunition,” he wrote.
