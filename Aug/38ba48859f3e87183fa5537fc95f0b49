A “huge drugs bust” at Gatwick airport has turned out to be part of a cake. A member of staff from Purezza vegan pizzeria was transporting the ingredients in a suitcase when they were stopped by police. The white powder, which was divided into blue bags, was tested before officers accepted it was legal. British Transport Police said: “‘Officers were called to Gatwick airport station at 1.34pm on 28 August after a suitcase was found containing 25 bags of powder. “Following a number of inquiries and tests, it was determined these bags of powder were cake ingredients for a vegan bakery. They were soon reunited with the owner, who has promised officers and staff a slice of cake in return.” The restaurant, which has stores in Brighton and London, tweeted: “Thanks for going easy on us guys! A slab of cake all round is in order when you’re next in Brighton.”
