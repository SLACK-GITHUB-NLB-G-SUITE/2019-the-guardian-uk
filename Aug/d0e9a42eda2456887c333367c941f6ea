Suze is a classic French aperitif, but here it’s combined with light and interesting flavours from all over Europe to make a delicious alternative to a summer spritz or G&T. Serves 1 30ml camomile-infused Suze – to make this, pour a quarter-bottle of Suze into a jar, add a camomile teabag, seal and leave to infuse20ml aquavit30ml orange juice, ideally freshly squeezed10ml sugar syrupTonic water, to top – we use Luscombe for its subtle flavour that won’t overpower the other ingredients1 slice orange, to garnishRose and/or orange blossom water, to spray a mist on top Fill a highball glass with lashings of ice, then add the Suze, aquavit, orange juice and syrup, and stir gently to combine. Top with tonic water, drop in the orange slice and spray a mist of rose and/or orange blossom water over the top. Adam Kerr, Discount Suit Company cocktail bar, London E1
