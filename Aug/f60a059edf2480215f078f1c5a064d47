Prof Hans Rausing, the head of the family that became Britain’s richest thanks to his father’s invention of Tetra Pak food containers, has died aged 93. In a statement, his family said Rausing had died peacefully in his sleep at Wadhurst Park, his private estate in East Sussex, with his wife, Märit, at his side. Swedish-born Rausing was the son of Ruben Rausing, who reportedly came up with the idea for Tetra Pak after his wife, Elisabeth Varenius, suggested he invent a lightweight alternative to milk bottles. Hans and his brother Gad marketed the product and today 137bn patented Tetra Paks are sold each year. The brothers moved to the UK in 1982 and topped the Sunday Times rich list in 1993 thanks to their packaging empire, before Hans sold his share of the business to his brother for £3.5bn in 1995. Hans Rausing, who was known for being scrupulously frugal to the extent that he wore a cheap Timex watch, faced criticism for seeking to minimise his UK tax bill despite his vast wealth. But he was also known for his philanthropy, for which he was knighted in 2006 in recognition of his support for organisations involved in innovation and research in medicine, human rights, culture and the environment. According to a statement by the Rausing family, he and his relatives have donated more than £1bn since 1998. He is survived by Märit, three children – Lisbet, Sigrid and Hans Kristian – and seven grandchildren. His children said in a joint statement: “Our father was an extraordinary man, achieving so many things in his long and distinguished career as entrepreneur and industrialist, and then as a philanthropist supporting multiple charities and foundations. “We are very proud of that, but most of all we will cherish our fond memories of him as a loving father and devoted family man.”
