Share your favourite free-to-enter gardens, parks and other green spaces around the UK. They may have beautifully kept flower beds, ancient woodland, rewilded wildflower meadows or even swimming lakes. They can be in urban areas, offering relaxation and recreation to commuters and a haven for fauna and flora, or further afield. Your favourite green space may just be a quiet wood or country park noted for its birdlife, or it could feature a cafe, outdoor gym facilities and rowing boats. Please give exact locations, websites and details of any useful facilities and interesting buildings. Remember, it’s your personal experience that counts – not the fame of the location. Please don’t include historic gardens that you have to pay to enter or parks outside the UK. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
