Who decides what’s womanly? Culture, you might say, or tradition, or the patriarchy. Or Jessica Fostekew, whose show Hench is delivered with the kind of welly that beefcakes reserve for the biggest punchbag in the gym. It certainly gives culture and tradition a run for their money, as Fostekew addresses her experience of being a muscular woman. “You’re a powerhouse,” she’s told at school – a compliment for a boy but double-edged at best for a girl, particularly one whose mum celebrates “grace and composure” as the ultimate feminine virtues. There’s not much composure on show here, as our host rails at gender stereotyping and the dieting industry, and hurls her childbirth story at the crowd. It’s a compelling companion piece to Josie Long’s pregnancy-and-birth show, elsewhere in town. But there are double the decibels as Fostekew’s machismo capitulates to the bodily agony. “GET THAT LONG ONE IN MY SPINE!” she shrieks, at which I’d have laughed a lot had I not been cowering from the speaker six inches from my ear. But if that set-piece suggests butch has its limits, the show grows in its conviction that women’s bodies, and who has the right to be strong, are too strictly circumscribed. Perhaps it’s more polemic than comedy by the end, as she singles out slimming companies for attaching points to foodstuffs and equating nourishment with sin. But there’s humour, too, on the association between testicles and bravery, and on the subject of her violent son. A lovely callback to the boy’s confused plaint “I don’t want whatever I want!” caps this potent show about the policing of women’s looks and strengths, by themselves and others. • At Monkey Barrel Comedy, Edinburgh, until 25 August.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.
