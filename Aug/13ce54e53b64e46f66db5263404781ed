The Catalans Dragons forward Kenny Edwards has been formally charged with inciting the crowd during last the disturbance in Perpignan on Saturday. The Super League match against Warrington was marred by a brawl on the pitch and fighting off it as tempers flared at the Stade Gilbert Brutus. James Child, the referee, issued two red cards and four yellows and the Rugby Football League’s match review panel handed out suspensions to the Catalans quartet Sam Tomkins, Michael McIlorum, Brayden Wiliame and Mickaël Simon as well as to the Warrington winger Tom Lineham. The panel also issued Edwards with a grade C charge of “other contrary behaviour”, which the RFL now says relates to allegedly inciting the crowd. The former Parramatta back-rower will face a hearing by an independent RFL tribunal on Tuesday evening. The RFL has, meanwhile, appointed an independent investigator to compile a report into the events off the field. This investigation, which is ongoing, will review evidence from a range of sources, including video evidence obtained from broadcasters inside the ground and posted online. According to the RFL’s operational rules, clubs are responsible for the actions of their spectators and all people purporting to be supporters. Both Catalans and Warrington have been asked to undertake their own internal investigations. The RFL says individual supporters are not bound by its operational rules so it is up to the clubs to determine what sanctions, if any, they take against any individuals.
