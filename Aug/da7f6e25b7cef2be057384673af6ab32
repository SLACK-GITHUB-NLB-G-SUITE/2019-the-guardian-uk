This beats an oversweet Pimm’s as a summer sundowner any day, though those of a certain age may find it hard to make without channelling the old, “Oooh, I could crush a grape”, Crackerjack catchphrase. Serves 1 5 white grapes, plus 1 extra to garnish5 basil leaves, plus 1 sprig to garnish25ml gin – we use Chase25ml lemon juiceIce10ml sugar syrupSauvignon blanc, to top – we use a fruity New Zealand one3-4 long, thin strips lemon peel, to garnish Muddle the grapes in a shaker, then add the basil and muddle again. Add the gin, lemon juice, sugar syrup and a handful of ice, then shake. Double strain into a tulip or cocktail glass over three ice cubes and top up with the wine. To garnish, make a cross-shaped incision in the top of the grape and gently pull apart the quarters, so it opens like a flower. Balance on the edge of the glass alongside the basil sprig, add the lemon strips (we tie ours together into a bundle) and serve. Pasquale Ferrillo, Manetta’s Bar, Fleming Hotel, London W1
