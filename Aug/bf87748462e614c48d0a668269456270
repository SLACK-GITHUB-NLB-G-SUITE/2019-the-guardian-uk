The Church of England has installed a helter skelter in Norwich Cathedral (Towering faith, 9 August) days after Rochester Cathedral introduced a crazy golf course to its nave. It’s all rather reminiscent of a dowager duchess acquiring a rubber miniskirt in an attempt to appear “cool”. Norwich Cathedral’s canon notes in your report that “some people can feel that cathedrals are slightly exclusive”. He’s right. C of E premises are still more than slightly exclusive, of course, to thousands of devout Christians in long-term same-sex relationships who would very much like their church to celebrate, or at the very least bless, their weddings. Is it any surprise that so many young people (whose common sense and moral compass are often underestimated) are deserting the Church of England? Unaccountably, they seem to be unmoved by helter skelters and crazy golf.Ben SummerskillCEO, Stonewall, 2003-14 • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
