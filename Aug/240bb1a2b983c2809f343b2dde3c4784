After international hilarity last week when it was first reported that Donald Trump was interested in buying Greenland, the US president has confirmed he is considering it. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, Trump said the “concept came up” and he was “looking at it”. However the government of Greenland has insisted it is not for sale. If you work or live in Greenland we would like to hear from you. How do you feel about Trump’s comments? What has been the reaction from friends and family?
