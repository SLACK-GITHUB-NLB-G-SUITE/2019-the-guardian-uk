Cecil Woolf was indeed generous and sociable. Two years ago I visited his home and publishing headquarters off Mornington Crescent in north London, to buy some Bloomsbury Heritage monographs while researching my book Virginia Woolf at Home, on the houses she knew in London, Cornwall and Sussex. I stayed for an hour, to talk and to listen, and more conversations followed, some by email from his house in Burgundy. He later readily agreed to write the bookâ€™s foreword. It was a particular pleasure to me that he had been able to see his short memoir The Other Boy at the Hogarth Press published.
