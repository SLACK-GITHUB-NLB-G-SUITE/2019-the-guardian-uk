The Liverpool winger Harry Wilson has joined Bournemouth on a season-long loan after Eddie Howe identified the Wales international as an ideal replacement for David Brooks. The Wales international impressed in pre-season for Liverpool, who placed a £25m valuation on his head earlier in the summer, but has been allowed to leave as Jürgen Klopp cannot offer the regular first-team football he needs this seaon. Wilson, 22, flourished on loan at Derby County last season, when he helped Frank Lampard’s team reach the Championship play-off final. Bournemouth will pay a loan fee of £2.5m plus £500,000 in performance-related bonuses. There is no option for a permanent transfer and Liverpool did not receive another offer they deemed suitable for the player this summer. Howe, the Bournemouth manager, views Wilson as a natural replacement for Brooks, who is facing three months on the sidelines with an ankle injury.
