There is an interesting trio of celestial objects to look out for on the evening of 8 August. The mighty planet Jupiter is currently close to the red giant star Antares in the constellation Scorpius. On 8 August, this pair will be joined by the moon. The chart shows the view looking south-south-east at 22:00 BST that evening. The moon will be on the fringes of Libra, the scales, preparing for a very close pass to Jupiter one night later. Giving the close pass an added aspect is the proximity of the beautiful red star Antares, a star so large that if it were to replace the sun in our solar system, its surface would be somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Looking further to the south, pale Saturn will be nestled in Sagittarius, the archer. There is also a dawn treat for early risers. Mercury will reach its further distance from the Sun in the morning sky this week. Watch out for a bright, steady “star” low in the brightening eastern sky.
