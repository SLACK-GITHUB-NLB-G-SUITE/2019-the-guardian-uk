A quarter of UK voters have started taking precautions against the adverse consequences of a no-deal Brexit, including stockpiling food, toiletries and medicines, according to a new Opinium/Observer poll. While 75% of those questioned said they had taken no special action, the remaining 25% said they had taken one or more of a series of measures listed by Opinium, which also included altering travel plans and delaying major purchases. The survey was taken after  leaks of official documents showed concerns within Whitehall about the effects of no deal on the supply of food, medicines and other items. Among those who had taken action, 9% said they had begun stockpiling goods, 8% said that they had delayed major purchases and 7% said they had altered travel plans. Among people who said they had begun stockpiling 57% said they bought extra tinned food, 45% extra medicines, 38% more toiletries and 30% additional toilet paper. The survey found Tory supporters had taken least action, with 80% saying they had done nothing. Some 63% of Labour backers said they had not acted, and 60% of Lib Dems had also done nothing. The poll shows that the public believes a no-deal on 31 October is now the most likely outcome. Some 37% of all voters say they believe there will not be a deal, against 22% who say they think Brexit will be delayed so the country can hold a general election or another referendum. Only 13% of voters say they think the UK will leave with a deal on or shortly after 31 October, while just 9% think Brexit will be delayed indefinitely or cancelled without a referendum. Some 40% of voters think that no deal will be bad for the economy, against 29% who think it will be a good thing for the national finances. Asked about their preferred outcome the public remains split, with 40% saying they would rather stay in the EU, 39% saying they would prefer to leave but remain closely aligned to the EU, and 39% preferring to leave and have a clear break from the EU. Overall the Conservatives have opened up a six-point lead over Labour, gaining one point in two weeks ago to stand on 32%, while Labour is down two points on 26% and the Brexit party unchanged on 16%. The Liberal Democrats are on 15%, the SNP 5%, the Greens on 4%, and Plaid Cymru and Ukip on 1%.
