Nicolas Roche was taken to hospital after being involved in a huge crash on stage six of the Vuelta a España. Roche, who held the leader’s jersey until Wednesday, attempted to carry on after the collision on the stage from Mora de Rubielos to Ares del Maestrat but abandoned soon afterwards. The incident also ended the races of Rigoberto Urán and Hugh Carthy, who were sent to hospital for further evaluation, while Víctor de la Parte was also forced to pull out. “It was quite a high speed all day and unfortunately, on one of the downhills, there was quite a big crash involving almost all our riders,” the coach Luke Roberts told Team Sunweb’s website. “Unfortunately Nico [Roche] had to abandon the race at that point and he was taken to hospital.” Dylan Teuns took the red jersey after finishing second behind Jesús Herrada. After forming part of an early break Herrada dropped Teuns in the final kilometre to finish seven seconds clear of the Belgian, with Dorian Godon in third. Teuns’s performance was enough to see him unseat Miguel Ángel López at the top of the general classification after the Colombian finished in the bunch, almost six minutes behind the stage winner. Teuns holds a 39-second lead over David de la Cruz in the GC standings, with López dropping to third.
