The champions begin their title defence at a ground where they have prospered under Pep Guardiola. Manchester City have scored 17 goals in their last four visits to the London Stadium and will start as heavy favourites against West Ham after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield. However the news that Leroy Sané requires knee surgery is a blow and West Ham have forwards who can hurt City, with Sébastien Haller and Pablo Fornals expected to make their debuts.
