The Scottish middle-distance runner Eilish McColgan has hit out at people who describe her as “skinny”, telling them to “go body shame elsewhere”. McColgan, who won silver for Great Britain in the 5,000m at the European championships in Berlin last year, made the comment on Twitter. She wrote: “Nothing pisses me off more than someone making a comment that I’m ‘too skinny’. I’m naturally small – always have been. Some people are just slim! I doubt they would comment on someone slightly larger than ‘average’. I’m a healthy athlete and human. Go body shame elsewhere!” Nothing pisses me off more than someone making a comment that I'm 'too skinny'. I'm naturally small-always have been. Some people are just slim! 😠I doubt they would comment on someone slightly larger than 'average'. I'm a healthy athlete and human. Go body shame elsewhere!🙄 pic.twitter.com/TmQtghTemn In a follow-up tweet the 28-year-old – daughter of Liz McColgan, who won gold in the 10,000m at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo, wrote: “It’s no surprise that young girls feel the need to get boob jobs, big plastic arses and contour themselves down to their kneecaps to fit what’s deemed the ‘ideal’ body. If you’re healthy and happy then don’t worry about anyone else’s opinion! It’s YOUR fabulous body.” This is not the first time McColgan has spoken out in strong fashion. Earlier this year, she described people who stole medals and jewellery from her home in Manchester as “horrible horrible scum”.
