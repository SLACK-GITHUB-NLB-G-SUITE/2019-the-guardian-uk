In less than two months, Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal. Those who voted to leave in 2016 were promised a negotiated deal by the Vote Leave campaign. The prime minister has now announced that he will prorogue parliament in an attempt to get a no-deal Brexit through. Such an unconstitutional coup risks compromising people’s jobs, security and living standards, as well as the Good Friday agreement. Now Boris Johnson is jeopardising all this for the sake of his own personal polling. It is clear that this has been done to stop MPs debating Brexit at our country’s most constitutionally charged time in recent history. We cannot allow the government to avoid scrutiny at this time of national crisis. We call for MPs to sit at an alternative parliament to continue holding the government to account and fight this most damaging Brexit.
