The actor Rose McGowan is to make her directorial debut with a politically charged cartoon feature about dogs. McGowan, who is about to perform in a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival, revealed more details about Pomerania to the Hollywood Reporter. ‘‘It’s about a little dog who hides in the closet, and once she comes out of the closet she becomes the queen of a land called Pomerania,” she said. “And she’s at war with Muttlandia, where all the mutts are. So, it’s all about race, breed, classism – and it’s very funny.’’ In reality, Pomerania is a region straddling Poland and Germany on the shore of the Baltic sea. It is not thought that McGowan’s project has geographical links to the area, but it is likely the canines featured are the spitz breed of toy dog that originated from the region. McGowan was the first person to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, claiming that he raped her at the Sundance film festival in 1997. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. She has since quit acting and says she is unhappy about the lack of support she was offered by the industry. ‘‘People in Hollywood have not been brave enough to step up for me as I stepped up for them,” she told the Hollywood Reporter. “Because I helped to clean out the system and they haven’t been brave in return. So, I do miss performing but I feel like acting is in the past, mostly because of the lack of support that I’ve gotten.’’
