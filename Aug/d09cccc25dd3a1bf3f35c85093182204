Alex Clark’s article (Journal, 19 August) on BBC Radio 4’s adaptation of Proust across the August bank holiday weekend was stimulating. Such comprehensive presentation might be accorded also to the music of living composers, who are often at risk of being judged simply on isolated performances of single works. Presenting music recently created alongside that of the last 100 years would certainly enable listeners to assess their achievements more accurately. Avoiding the creation of a seclusion zone for new music, suitable contexts where their work becomes meaningful should be planned. Works by Mark-Anthony Turnage might be featured alongside popular music by Beyoncé and Led Zeppelin. Michael Finnissy’s transcriptions of Gershwin could be set alongside his own works. And some of Giles Swayne’s music might be related to gamelan music. In short, “new music” should be presented as a fresh continuation of many traditions. For indeed, it’s just like life.Meirion BowenLondon
