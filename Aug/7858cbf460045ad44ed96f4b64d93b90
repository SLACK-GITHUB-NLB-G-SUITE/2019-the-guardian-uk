Cornwall’s biggest festival, Boardmasters in Newquay, has been cancelled due to a severe weather forecast. 50,000 people were due to watch performances by Florence and the Machine, Foals, Wu-Tang Clan and others but according to a statement from the festival, “the potential risk is too severe for the event to go ahead at this time”. The Met Office issued a pair of weather warnings on Tuesday regarding rain and wind, saying there was a chance of flooding and power cuts in the area. The festival site, which is situated on the coast at Watergate Bay, was due to face the brunt of the high winds. Festival organisers apologised for disruption to local businesses, and advised ticketholders to follow the festival’s social media feeds for information about refunds.

It has grown to become the biggest festival west of Glastonbury. Other acts that were due to play this year’s event include Dizzee Rascal, Giggs, Jorja Smith and the Wombats.
