A “freak accident” has forced Carl Frampton to pull out of his scheduled fight against Emmanuel Dominguez. The Northern Irishman said a “large ornament” had fallen on his left hand in a hotel lobby, fracturing his fifth metacarpal. He added: “I’m absolutely devastated.” The 32-year-old had been due to fight Mexico’s Dominguez in Philadelphia on Saturday ahead of a shot at the featherweight title. Frampton tweeted a video earlier in the day showing him running on a treadmill during what he called his “last hard session”. He said: “It’s fight week now, training done, time to focus on the fight!” pic.twitter.com/veNPrmUV8Y The injury marked another setback in the Belfast boxer’s quest to again be a world champion. He had considered retirement following the shock defeat by Josh Warrington in December before then preparing to fight earlier this summer. But the adjournment of his court case with his former manager Barry McGuigan ensured a delay. The boxer, who has been the world champion at featherweight and super-bantamweight levels, signed a multi-fight deal with the US promoter Top Rank in March.
