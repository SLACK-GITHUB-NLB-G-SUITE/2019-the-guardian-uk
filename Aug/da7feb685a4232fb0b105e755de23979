Icy winds up to 120km/h, snow, wild surf and rain continue to lash South Australia, Victoria and parts of New South Wales – even breaking the Frankston pier from its moorings – on Friday morning. The “strongest weather system this winter” to hit south-east Australia has continued its path of carnage across the country, grounding flights in Sydney and Melbourne, and leading to hundreds of calls to the State Emergency Service across SA and Victoria. Overnight Victoria registered 120km/h winds at Cape Otway, 98km/h at Warrnambool, and even 87/km/h along Melbourne’s seaside suburbs. Not a morning to ride to work! The bike path at Brighton battered by a storm surge and wind gusts up to 87 km/hr.

The end of Frankston Pier has snapped off and is floating away @3AW693 pic.twitter.com/OB49PjS8z6 One local resident, Sharyn Murdoch, told Guardian Australia: “The Frankston pier snapped off and I saw it floating by near Waves Restaurant. “We saw the end of it dropping at about 9am. Then it started drifting past at about 9.30am. It gave us all something to talk about at work. More novel than all the dolphins we see.” Huge mistake.#frankstonpier pic.twitter.com/LnyMoYGi3t On Friday morning the bureau said the worst of the Melbourne winds – which were predicted to be up to 110km/h – would ease after 9am, even as the rain moved in. But in Sydney, the bureau said gusts would pick up – with winds up to 90km/h “likely from mid-morning”. A spokesperson for Sydney airport told news.com.au that 20 flights had been cancelled or delayed, while in Melbourne, 25 domestic services were cancelled. In Victoria the State Emergency Service had 157 calls for help across the state between 6am Thursday and 6am Friday, the majority for fallen trees and a few for building damage. In SA on Friday morning, 6,000 properties remained without power after thunderstorms hit the state yesterday from Ceduna to Renmark. Severe weather warnings remain in place for SA, Victoria and NSW. Damaging winds are predicted for most of Victoria. Blizzard conditions were expected across alpine areas on Friday, with snow expected above 500 metres and flurries possible for the Dandenong Ranges. Icy temperatures were also set to continue across the state, with Melbourne headed for a top of 11C, but strong winds were likely to make it feel much colder. #melbweather #melbourneweather pic.twitter.com/ivZwCRJyeU “It doesn’t really improve across the weekend,” Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster, Michael Efron said, with Melbourne set to hit just 11C again on Saturday, Ballarat 7C and Bendigo 10C. For the late night viewers - a deep low pressure system bringing severe weather to the southern states is tracking eastwards into Bass Strait.
