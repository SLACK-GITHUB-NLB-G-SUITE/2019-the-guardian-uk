Manchester United cannot take a hint. Jadon Sancho might have agreed a new £190,000 contract with Borussia Dortmund, but that will not stop United from making a £100m bid for the England winger in January. Dortmund will consider selling on one condition: Ole Gunnar Solskjær has to tell Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford that Fred takes all the penalties from now on. United do not plan to stop at Sancho as they hunt for attacking reinforcements. They are also in for Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz, though they face competition for the £90m forward from Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City. Someone’s PR team have been busy! Elsewhere, Barcelona remain interested in signing Neymar, who retired from football two years ago. However Paris Saint-Germain have rejected their hilarious opening offer of a loan with an option to buy for £137m – they’re after a whopping £229m for the Brazilian. Perhaps Barça, beaten by Athletic Bilbao in their opening La Liga game, can finance the deal with all that money they received for the transfers of Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and Ousmane Dembélé. Ahem! Meanwhile, Tottenham are in talks to sell Victor Wanyama to Club Brugge for £11m, but Michy Batshuayi wants to stay and fight for his place at Chelsea – even though Frank Lampard appears to think he’s about as good as Mateja Kezman. Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren is a target for Leverkusen. Southampton’s Mario Lemina is set to join Monaco on loan. Atlético Madrid are closing in on Dinamo Zagreb winger Dani Olmo. Ian Holloway is a target for the Brexit Party.
