Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our five-year-old beige carpets are looking distinctly grubby after we had the builders in. Our local supermarket hires out Rug Doctor wet vacuums for £25 a go that promise a dramatic clean. The big question is: do they deliver the goods or are there better options? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
