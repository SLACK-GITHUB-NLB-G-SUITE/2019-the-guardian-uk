Svetlana Kuznetsova upset top seed Ashleigh Barty 6-2 6-4 to reach the Western and Southern Open final in Cincinnati. Defeat denied Barty a return to the top of the WTA Rankings one week after swapping places with Naomi Osaka. Russian Kuznetsova quickly recovered after losing the opening two games to win her third match in a row against a top-10 opponent in 68 minutes. The two-time grand slam champion will play Madison Keys in Sunday’s showpiece after the American overcame Sofia Kenin 7-5 6-4. Kuznetsova has slipped from world number two to 153 in the rankings after periods of inactivity, but has been in top form throughout the week and maintained that in her semi-final. The 34-year old was helped by her Australian opponent making 27 unforced errors in a below-par performance. World number 18 Keys overcame fellow American Kenin, four places below her in the rankings, with an impressive display to reach her first hardcourt final since the 2017 US Open. Keys squandered two set points in the opener, but after being pegged back to 5-5 she broke Kenin for a second time to take it 7-5. Kenin led 3-1 in the second set after an early break and after both players had lost their serve twice, Keys held to lead 5-4 and broke her opponent again, with the help of a stunning cross-court back-hand winner, to clinch the match. The Western and Southern Open is the last significant warm-up event before the year’s final grand slam, the US Open.
