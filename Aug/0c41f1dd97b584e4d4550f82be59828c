I have been experiencing a total nightmare with Solarplicity since March after quitting my contract. It owes me about £100 and I’ve called over 40 times over five months to be told I will hear within seven days. I get an automatic reply to emails saying I will hear within five days, but I never get a response. PM, London In June 2018 I changed from SSE to Solarplicity. Two months later I realised I was also still paying SSE. Solarplicity had transferred someone else’s account and debited £310. Eventually, in January I was refunded £211 but I’m still owed £99. The Ombudsman ruled this should be paid along with £50 compensation. In May the company promised to pay – the compensation arrived but not the £99. JM, Aboyne, Aberdeenshire Within days of receiving your letters, Solarplicity went into administration, the latest in a series of small suppliers to go bust over the last two years. The company had become notorious for its poor customer service and finished bottom of the 2019 Which? customer satisfaction survey for energy. Last week EDF was appointed by the regulator Ofgem to take over its customers. It has undertaken to refund any outstanding credit, but this could take months. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, says: “Customers should take meter readings and avoid switching right now as they may risk losing any refunds they might be entitled to.” If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
