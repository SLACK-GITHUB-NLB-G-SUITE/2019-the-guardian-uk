Prince Andrew has commented on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, sayinghe did not “see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction”. In a statement issued on Saturday, the Duke of York said there had been immense speculation about the convicted sex offender who apparently killed himself in a New York jail earlier this month. “This is particularly the case in relation to my former association or friendship with Mr Epstein. Therefore I am eager to clarify the facts to avoid further speculation.” Andrew said he met Epstein in 1999 and saw him once or twice a year during the time he knew him, and also stayed several of his residences. “At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction,” the duke said. “I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.” Video footage emerged this week showing the prince inside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2010. Epstein, 66, died this month in an apparent suicide in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking. He was accused of abusing underage girls and making some of them pleasure several of his rich and powerful friends. The prince said he had “tremendous sympathy” for everyone affected by the financier’s actions and behaviour. “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. “This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.” More details soon …
