Grace Dent should resist the current trend for putting down GPs (I’m angry, sore, and bloated. Is this the menopause?, Weekend, 17 August) Yes, you may wait two weeks for an appointment, but your issues have been going on for months. Once in the consultation (15 minutes is the norm in my surgery), describe your symptoms and you will receive a well-informed and helpful assessment and subsequent advice. Remember, lots of GPs are women and many of us are over 50. Trust me, if there’s one thing I do know about, it’s the menopause!Lucy PenderedGP, Taunton, Somerset • Grace, please contact your GP and ask for a simple CA125 blood test. Feeling bloated and a change in bowel habits (you mention constipation) can be symptoms of ovarian cancer. Yet if you Google these symptoms, you will be directed to page after page about irritable bowel syndrome, or the menopause, but not ovarian cancer. Women over 50 (I know you’re only 45) rarely develop irritable bowel syndrome. Caught early, ovarian cancer is curable.Sarah DanielsLondon • Good to see the range of “triumph over adversity” stories (Making the grade, 16 August). No identical twins with identical results, though. Perhaps we need to wait for GCSE grades this week.Ruth EversleyPaulton, Somerset • With England already in his possession, why does Trump need Greenland (Report, 17 August)?Adam CzerniawskiMonmouth • Cryptic crossword clue (16 August), 11 across: “Group that’s favoured by the Conservatives.” Answer: “Status Quo.” Surely not!Susan MajorYork • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
