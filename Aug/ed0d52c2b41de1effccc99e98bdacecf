The long shot This involves catching the ball and shooting from a distance, over the defender. Shooters should have their hips and shoulders square to the korf (net). Focus on shooting just over the closest point of the rim. Simultaneously thrust with legs and arms, rising from the toes before locking both the legs and elbows, giving a flick with the wrists and fingers. Running-in shot When you catch the ball while running, you’re allowed to take two steps. Use these to move past your defender and take the shot. One foot strikes the ground, then one step is taken on to the preferred take-off leg. Thrust up with the knee of the other leg and lift the ball as high as possible. Defending Players change roles every two goals, so they have to be able to attack and defend. When the attacker receives the ball, the defender’s straight arm should be in reaching distance. Position yourself between the player and the post, keep your arms up ready to block, and always follow the ball. • As told to Zainab Saleem
