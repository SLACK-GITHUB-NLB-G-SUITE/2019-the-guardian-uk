Cieren Fallon, the apprentice who has the bookmakers running scared, heads to Wolverhampton for three booked rides on Monday evening hoping to end what has been a frustrating sequence. The 20-year-old son of Kieren Fallon, the six-times champion jockey, Fallon Jr rode a winner at Brighton last Wednesday followed by 20 mounts since then with a number of close seconds, but nothing reaching the winner’s circle. For months his skills and strike rate have deservedly caught punters’ attention. He has made no secret of big ambitions – and at his age when you’re hot you want to stay hot. But patience is another of his race-riding assets and this will stand him in good stead. It would raise many a smile if he crosses his name off the slightly cool list in Wolverhampton’s 5.50 race when riding a horse called Cauthen. It was Steve Cauthen, the Kentucky Kid, of course, who sensationally won the US Triple Crown in 1978 when only a little younger that Fallon Jr is now. The coincidence is purely in name only, yet a win on Monday night would be warming sight for older hands in racing. When Cauthen, the jockey, began a brilliant European career, he was invariably aboard better mounts than Cauthen, this horse, and it will be interesting to watch Fallon Jr trying to win from a wide draw in this 12-runner field. No offence is intended to the three-year-old gelding or his connections! Better prospects for punters are probably held in the last race on the card with Avenue Foch (8.50 Wolverhampton). James Fanshawe had his own quiet time for a while but his Newmarket stable is very much in top form now, with five winners from his last 16 runners. Trained previously by Luca Cumani, Avenue Foch has had just two runs for Fanshawe, the latest a fifth-placed finish over over course and distance six weeks ago. He has been dropped 3lb since and can strike with George Wood taking over in the saddle.
