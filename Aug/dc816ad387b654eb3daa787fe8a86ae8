A mysterious substance that has turned a tributary of a river in the West Country bright blue is being investigated by the Environment Agency. Tests are being carried out on the River Frome in Somerset this weekend after the water turned a luminous colour. The Environment Agency said it was treating it as a suspected “pollution incident” but there were no reports of dead wildlife. Test results are expected on Monday and the agency said it would continue to monitor the stream over the weekend. A spokesman asked for anyone with information to contact the Environment Agency. The agency added: “We are investigating a pollution incident near Frome that has turned a tributary of the River Frome bright blue. “There are no reports of wildlife in distress or dead. Samples have been taken for testing. “We will continue to monitor the stream over the weekend.” Meanwhile, the UK has become one of the first countries in Europe where people will be able to receive flood alerts on their computer, phone or personal device through the Google Public Alerts map. The Environment Agency said it has been working with the internet giant for two years to design and implement the service, which has been rolled out in the US, South America and parts of Asia to alert residents to environmental emergencies such as earthquakes, wildfires and extreme temperatures. John Curtin, head of flood and coastal risk management at the agency, said: “This pioneering service will ensure that our live flood warnings and safety advice reaches even more people when it is most needed, giving UK residents access to the first service of this kind in Europe. “We are always looking to find innovative ways to give people advance warning of potential flood risk so they can take action to keep themselves and their property safe. “We will continue to work closely with Google to explore ways in which we can further develop this fundamental public warning service.”
