Norfolk techno festival Houghton has been cancelled due to bad weather, the second major UK festival to do so this week. The festival was due to take place in the grounds of stately home Houghton Hall, and host dance artists including Four Tet, Floating Points and Ricardo Villalobos. Organisers said the decision was made in consultation with local authorities, and published a statement saying: “Weather conditions on site at Houghton festival have dramatically worsened and are set to deteriorate further into the weekend. “We are utterly devastated. All the hard work, love and creativity that has gone into planning and producing this year’s event made this an almost impossible decision to make … nothing is more important than the safety of our customers, staff and performers, which would be compromised if we were to go ahead.” Thunderstorms and gusts of over 40mph are forecast for the area. Festival ticketholders are being told not to travel to the site, and that refunds will be made, with further information later today. Earlier this week, Newquay festival Boardmasters, which was to host 50,000 people, also cancelled due to weather warnings. A spokesperson for Cornwall’s Chamber of Commerce described it as “a bitter blow” for local businesses. Councillor Oliver Monk told the BBC: “It’s three days of maximum trade, and cancelling it has a massive, massive knock-on effect for all the businesses in town.”
