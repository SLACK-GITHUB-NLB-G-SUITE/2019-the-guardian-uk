The first trailer for Last Christmas, the highly-anticipated romcom scripted by Emma Thompson and themed around the songs of George Michael, has been released. The film, which is due to hit screens in time for the holiday season, has only recently finished shooting in London. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding star as a disgruntled jobbing elf in a seasonal popup shop and the soup kitchen volunteer she keeps bumping into. Thompson plays Clarke’s ageing and possibly Russian mother, while Golding’s Crazy Rich Asians co-star Michelle Yeoh is Clarke’s boss. Gentleman Jack star Lydia Leonard plays Clarke’s sister. The trailer showcases a ticklist of festive locations in the capital, including Alexandra Palace ice rink and Covent Garden market, as well as tunes from Michael including ‘Faith’ and the title tune. Thompson began writing the film while Michael was still alive, and the plot – especially its homelessness theme – had his blessing. Since his death on Christmas Day 2016, Feig and Thompson have reportedly worked closely with his estate, and the film will feature at least one unreleased track recorded by the singer. “The great sadness is that he’s not here to be a part of this,” Feig has said. “But he knew it was going to happen, and that gives me such joy. We feel like he’s here with us.” • This article was amended on 14 August 2019. Lydia Leonard, not Sian Clifford as an earlier version said, plays the sister of Emilia Clarke’s character.
