On Friday baked potato chain Spudulike announced they had become the latest casualty of the British high street, with all 37 of their UK stores closing down. Originally from Edinburgh, the chain peaked in popularity during the 1980s and 1990s, but in recent years struggled to compete with an explosion of new fast food competitors. In celebration of the mighty jacket potato, we’re asking you to share your most spudtastic anecdotes. Do baked potatoes occupy a special place in your heart? What’s your favourite filling – or is it a topping? Do you have your own methods for prepping the perfect potato? Or maybe you’ve just got a lovely story to tell about a baked potato-filled childhood. Either way, share your spud love in the form below.
