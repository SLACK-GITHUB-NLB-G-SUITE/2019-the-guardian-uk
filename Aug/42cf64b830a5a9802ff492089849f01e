When does Sunday start? I’m usually up at 8am, occasionally 9.30 if I’ve had a late one. I teach piano lessons at home from 10am, and on occasion I’ve been known to wake up with a jolt at the sound of my first pupil ringing the doorbell. I’m in the process of clearing all my work from Sundays, though. I want the day for me. Breakfast or brunch? There’s no time to eat before lessons start, but luckily I’m a brunch girl. I’ll have a coffee first thing and then once classes are over it’s straight to my favourite café, Dirty Apron in Deptford. Their bubble and squeak with salsa chutney is dreamy. What do Sundays smell like? Wet soil. It’s the day I put all my plants into the shower and water them like I’m their mummy at bath time. Your Sunday happy place? On the sofa reading a book with a glass of wine. I’ve just finished Educated by Tara Westover; right now I’m deep into Pema Chödrön’s When Things Fall Apart. That, or in the pub after taking a river walk. What’s for lunch? My boyfriend and I are famous for roasts – we’ll do chicken with stuffing and a giant bowl of greens. There’s a great butcher in Deptford, WH Wellbeloved. What are you listening to? D’Angelo’s Black Messiah. There’s no better soundtrack to the day. No one can be sad when that record is playing. When is bedtime? Often 3am or later. I love to write music on Sunday nights. The outside world is sleeping, no emails are coming in and it’s quiet at home. Last thing you look at? My diary for the week ahead. Everything is mad right now, so I’m regimented about never looking more than seven days ahead. I see what’s coming up and prepare myself, then make a list to clear my head before bed. Rosie Lowe’s new album, Yu, is out now (rosielowe.com)
