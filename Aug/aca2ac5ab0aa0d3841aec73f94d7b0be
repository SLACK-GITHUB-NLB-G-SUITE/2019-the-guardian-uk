The Ryder Cup winner Thorbjørn Olesen will appear in court on 21 August after being charged with sexual assault, being drunk on an aircraft and common assault. Olesen, who beat the three-times major winner Jordan Spieth in Europe’s triumph over the United States in Paris last year, was arrested last week after returning from the WGC St Jude Invitational on a flight from Nashville to London. Police were waiting for the five-times European Tour winner when the aircraft landed at Heathrow. The 29-year-old Dane was taken into custody and subsequently released under investigation. The Metropolitan police said: “A man has been charged in connection with an incident on an inbound flight to Heathrow airport on Monday 29 July.” Olesen, 29, of Kensington and Chelsea, “was charged by postal requisition on Thursday, 1 August with sexual assault, being drunk on an aircraft and common assault”, police said. He is due to appear at Uxbridge magistrates court on Wednesday 21 August. On Monday Olesen’s lawyer, Paul Morris, said: “Thorbjørn has cooperated fully with the police during their investigation but, while the legal proceedings are still ongoing, he unfortunately cannot comment on this matter at this time.”
