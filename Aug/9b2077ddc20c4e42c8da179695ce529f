Wales will be without one of their most experienced and influential forwards in the World Cup after their Lions No 8 Taulupe Faletau suffered a broken collarbone in training this week. Wales have got used to life without the 72-cap Faletau who was a virtual ever-present in the side after making his debut in 2011 until he joined Bath five years later. He has started only two Six Nations matches in his three seasons in the west country having suffered knee and arm injuries. The 28-year-old has not played for Wales since the end of the 2018 Six Nations campaign, twice suffering a broken arm last season to restrict his starts for the club to five, but his absence will be felt even if back row is one of their better stocked positions. “The injury was sustained in an innocuous training ground incident and will require surgery,” said Wales in a statement. “A prognosis and return to play timeframe will be established after surgery.​ The Wales squad and management wish Taulupe the very best with his recovery.” Only last week Faletau expressed his hope that his run of injuries had come to an end, saying: “I didn’t realise at the time but being away from rugby for that amount of time, the hunger is there more now. When you are doing it year in, year out, you take it for granted at times. When I get on the pitch, I hope I last longer than last time.”
