Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’ve just discovered that my iPhone 6s, which I bought for £300 only three years ago, won’t be getting any iOS software updates after September. Is this something I should be worried about, or will it carry on working fine? I’ll be a bit pissed off if I have to buy a new one. Is there any reason why Apple can’t keep supporting its phones when they are three years old? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
