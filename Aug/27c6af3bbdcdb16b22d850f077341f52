Ribollita is a dish that has a special place in my heart. It’s a traditional and robust Italian soup, perfect for using up surplus vegetables and stale bread, and is a superb example of root-to-fruit eating, zero waste and food sustainability. I began my journey into sustainability advocacy because of Tristram Stuart. Stuart is one of the main people responsible for opening the world’s eyes to the global food waste scandal and the fact that around 40% of all food is wasted. He caused this stir by launching an initiative called Feeding the 5,000, a global event that turns hundreds of tonnes of food waste into a feast, where everyone is welcome. At the first of these events, I was invited to do a cooking demonstration. To prepare for the event, I spent the day at the legendary Italian restaurant River Cafe, in London, making their version of ribollita. Here’s what I learned. Heat two tablespoons of best olive oil in a large, thick-based saucepan on a medium heat. Add 300g roughly chopped seasonal vegetables (celery, carrots, red onion, etc) and saute for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and a crushed garlic clove, then add 250g of super-ripe – even bruised – chopped tomatoes, a sprig of rosemary and a can of white beans, including their cooking water. Top up with enough water to cover all the vegetables, then bring to a boil. Add 125g chopped cavolo nero or other greens, including the stalks, and bring back to a boil. Tear in three slices of stale bread (ideally wholemeal sourdough) in chunks, and leave for a few minutes for the bread to soften. Season to taste, drizzle with lots of olive oil, and serve garnished with celery and carrot leaves if you have them.
