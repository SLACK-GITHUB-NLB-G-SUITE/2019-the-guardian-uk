Australia will prepare for next year’s Olympic qualifiers with friendlies against Chile in Adelaide and Sydney this November. The Matildas are set to host the South Americans in their first matches on home soil since this year’s World Cup in France. The two games will act as warm-ups for the qualifiers starting in February to secure a spot in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The first match at Bankwest Stadium on 9 November will be the first appearance by an Australian national sporting team at the Parramatta-based venue. Their trip to Coopers Stadium on 12 November is the Matildas’ first appearance in South Australia since 2006. Australia will join China, Taiwan, Myanmar, North Korea, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam for one of the two remaining spots from Asia for next year’s women’s football tournament at the Olympics, with Japan already qualified as hosts. The Westfield Matildas will become the first Australian national football team to grace Bankwest Stadium, and Football Federation Australia (FFA) Chief Executive David Gallop AM acknowledged the support of the NSW Government in bringing the game to life. Head Coach Ante Milicic welcomed confirmation that his team will take on the rising South American nation as Australia begins to set its sights on qualification for next year’s Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. “It is fantastic that we have been able to secure these international friendlies,” Milicic said. “Chile performed admirably in a difficult group at this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in France and will provide a strong challenge for us as we seek to develop as a unit leading up to our Tokyo 2020 Olympic Qualifiers which commence in February next year.”
