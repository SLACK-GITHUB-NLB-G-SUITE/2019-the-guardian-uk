The cousin of the sacked rugby star Israel Folau has reportedly been let go from his job at a Sydney Catholic school after calling the church a “synagogue of Satan”. Twenty-year-old Josiah Folau was dismissed in July from his post as a boarding house supervisor at St Gregory’s College in Campbelltown, the Australian reported. The former captain of the school is a member of the Truth of Jesus Christ Church, as is Israel Folau. Josiah Folau has labelled Catholicism “masked devil worship”, according to Nine newspapers. He has also posted comments and a video on Instagram that were critical of the Catholic church, calling mass “a paganistic ritual rooted in heresy, evil and devil worship”, the Australian reported. The St Gregory’s headmaster, Lee McMaster, confirmed Josiah Folau’s departure. “We have met with Josiah recently and, in our discussions, Josiah has made the decision to discontinue his casual employment at St Gregory’s College,” he told News Corp. “We respect Josiah’s privacy in this matter.” The boarding house master’s removal comes months after his cousin was dumped by Rugby Australia after posting on social media that homosexuals would go to hell unless they repented. It was the second time Israel Folau sparked controversy through his social media accounts. He was reprimanded for a similar post in 2018. This week Folau lodged a claim against Rugby Australia seeking $10m damages, an apology and reinstatement.
