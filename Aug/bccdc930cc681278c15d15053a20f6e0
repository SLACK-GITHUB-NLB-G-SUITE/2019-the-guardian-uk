Chelsea’s Davide Zappacosta is to join Roma on a season’s loan, subject to a medical this week. The defender has not played since Frank Lampard took over as manager and made only four Premier League appearances last season. Zappacosta joined Chelsea for an initial £23m from Torino in 2017 and will have one year remaining on his contract at the end of this campaign. The 27-year-old is in line to become the third experienced defender to leave the club since May, following David Luiz and Gary Cahill. Zappacosta has not held down a regular starting place at Chelsea and most of the right-back’s appearances last season under Maurizio Sarri came in the Europa League.
