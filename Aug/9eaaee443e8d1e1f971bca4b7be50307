Manchester City have reopened talks with Juventus over signing the full-back João Cancelo in a transfer which could take Danilo in the opposite direction. Juventus turned down an offer earlier this summer from City of €40m (£36.5m) plus Danilo for Cancelo, saying they were interested only in a straight money offer of €60m, but they are now willing to consider the Brazilian in part-exchange. Talks are ongoing and a meeting is due soon. Cancelo, a Portugal international, is most comfortable at right-back, although he can also play at left-back and higher up the pitch. He joined Juventus on a five-year contract for €40.4m last summer from Valencia, having previously played for Internazionale and Benfica. The 25-year-old would compete with Kyle Walker for the right-back position at City, while having the versatility to fill other roles. Juventus are also negotiating with Manchester United over a deal which could bring Paulo Dybala to Old Trafford in a swap involving Romelu Lukaku.
