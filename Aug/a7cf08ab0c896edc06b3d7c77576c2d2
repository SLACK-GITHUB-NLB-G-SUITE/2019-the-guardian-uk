Jimmy Anderson has been sent for a scan on his right calf following the first session of the opening Ashes Test. The England bowler had not been seen in the attack since his opening four-over spell, though he did return to field after a brief time off the pitch. At lunch, concerns over the 37-year-old were realised as the England and Wales Cricket Board announced the record wicket-taking fast bowler would need a scan. Anderson had been rested for last week’s Ireland Test because of his injured calf but was passed fit for action against Australia. It became clear that represented a gamble, leaving England a bowler down for the short term at least. “Jimmy Anderson has tightness to his right calf and will have a scan this afternoon,” said an ECB statement. “A further update will be given later today. He felt tightness at the end of his fourth over.”
