Brighton have strengthened their defence with the signing of Adam Webster from Bristol City. The terms of the deal were undisclosed but it is understood Brighton will pay what would be a club-record £20m fee for the 24-year-old, who has signed a four-year deal. Webster’s arrival comes while Brighton’s Lewis Dunk is being widely linked with a move to Leicester as a replacement for Manchester United-bound Harry Maguire. The Brighton head coach Graham Potter, who faced Webster while managing in the Championship last season, said: “Adam is a player the club has been aware of for some time, and someone we came up against last season at Swansea City. He is a quality defender, comfortable on the ball, fits the profile of the type of player we want to bring to the club, and he was very keen to join us. “He is still relatively young but has good experience from the number of games he has played. Predominately a centre-half, he can also play at right-back, and he will bring additional competition alongside our existing defensive options.” Webster spent only one season at Ashton Gate, having joined Bristol from Ipswich last summer for £3.5m with clauses potentially taking that to £8m. The former Portsmouth defender made 47 appearances for City last season, scoring three goals. He has also worked with Brighton’s technical director Dan Ashworth while featuring for England at under-18 and under-19 level earlier in his career.
