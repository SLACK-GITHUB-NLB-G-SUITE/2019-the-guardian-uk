Steven Gerrard’s warning to his Rangers side not to take Europa League opponents FC Midtjylland lightly was heeded, with the Scottish side cruising to a 3-1 win at Ibrox. Leading 4-2 from the first leg, Rangers to all intents killed the tie in the 14th minute when Alfredo Morelos opened the scoring from Sheyi Ojo’s cross. The Liverpool loanee Ojo hit a second six minutes before half-time and Morelos the third shortly after the interval. Evander Da Silva Ferreira pulled one back for the Danes in the 72nd minute but Rangers advance to meet Legia Warsaw for a place in the group stages. Aberdeen were knocked out by Rijeka on a bitterly disappointing night at Pittodrie. Trailing 2-0 from the first leg in Croatia, Derek McInnes’s side were two goals and a man down after little more than half an hour. Rijeka’s first goal came from a counter-attack following an Aberdeen corner, Stjepan Loncar converting a cross to leave Aberdeen needing to score four. A difficult task became impossible after 20 minutes when Funso Ojo – already on a yellow card – lunged into a late challenge and was dismissed. Antonio Colak soon added a second to complete a 4-0 aggregate win for the Croatians. In Wales the New Saints were beaten 4-0 by Ludogorets of Bulgaria at Wrexham’s Racecourse Stadium and bowed out 9-0 over the two legs. Celtic, eliminated from the Champions League on Tuesday, will face AIK of Stockholm in the play-off after the Swedes knocked out Sheriff Tiraspol of Moldova.
