I have no sexual desire for my husband of 23 years, although I love him as a person and the father of my children. I want to end the marriage, but he does not. I am in love with someone else and we would like to be together – we have been friends for more than 20 years and lovers in between. I would like to be true to myself and the people around me. I have agreed to relationship counselling at my daughter’s suggestion. I know it won’t do anything, but at least I can say I tried. Also, I hope that speaking to a professional will help my husband acknowledge it is time to separate. I’ve always cared about my family’s happiness and feel so guilty for wanting to do what I want. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
