There are two outstanding issues following Steve Smith’s concussion at the Lord’s test (Report, 19 August). The first is that the International Cricket Council should appoint an independent panel of neurologists whose members should be in attendance at all international cricket matches. The second is that all international cricket players should have brain scans in their off-season so that the neurologists can have a baseline from which to judge the extent of an injury during a match. Ditto boxing, rugby, polo and all other contact sports. Derek WyattFounder, The Brain Campaign • Quick crossword 15,379, 3 down, “What the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is for Boris”, incorrectly has the answer “safe seat”. Boris Johnson’s majority was halved to just over 5,000 in 2017. It is now marginal and is being strongly contested by a local man, Labour’s Ali Milani. As Boris is rarely seen here, perhaps the answer should have been “part-time”.Jane SmithUxbridge, London • Could we have Adrian Chiles every day, please (G2, 22 August)?
