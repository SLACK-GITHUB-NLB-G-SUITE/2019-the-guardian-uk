A man accused of murdering PC Andrew Harper while he was investigating a reported burglary has denied any involvement in his killing. Jed Foster, 20, was charged on Monday over the death of the 28-year-old Thames Valley police constable in the village of Sulhamstead, in Berkshire. Harper died from multiple injuries after being dragged under a vehicle on Thursday evening. Foster appeared at Reading magistrates court on Tuesday charged with Harper’s murder and with the theft of a quad bike. In front of a packed public gallery he confirmed his name, date of birth and address. The hearing lasted about three minutes. Foster, from Burghfield, near Reading, was not asked to enter pleas. District Judge Davinder Lachhar remanded him in custody until Wednesday, when he will appear at Reading crown court. His lawyer, Rob Jacques, said: “On behalf of him and his family I want to say three things: he denies any involvement in the horrific murder of PC Harper; we urge the police to follow all lines of inquiry; and for the public to come forward and cooperate.” Foster was handcuffed before he left the dock, and there was a heavy police presence at court. He was charged after Thames Valley police investigators were granted an extra 24 hours to question 10 suspects, with the remaining nine granted bail until 13 September. All 10 suspects were arrested at a caravan park near to, and within an hour of, the incident. The youngest was aged 13, the oldest 30. On Monday, the officer’s widow, Lissie Harper, paid tribute to her husband, describing him as “the kindest, loveliest, most selfless” person. She wrote: “There is not enough paper in the world to even begin to write a tribute for you, but no one deserves it more.”
