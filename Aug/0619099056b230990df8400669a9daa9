Crystal Palace have won the race to sign the former England and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill. The 33-year-old, who was released by Chelsea at the end of last season after seven years with the club, has signed a two-year contract worth around £75,000 per week. Palace have beaten off interest from Burnley, West Ham and Aston Villa for the centre-half, who won 61 caps for England. Cahill had been a regular for Chelsea since the 2012-13 season but made only two Premier League appearances last season. During his Stamford Bridge spell Cahill won the Premier League twice, lifted the Champions League trophy and also won the FA Cup and the Europa League. He told Palace’s official site: “I’m glad to be here, I think it’s a good opportunity for me to continue my career in the Premier League, and to play in a good, exciting team. There are some very exciting, talented players here. I’m looking forward to the challenge.” Palace, who also signed Stephen Henderson and Jordan Ayew this summer, have also been linked with a loan move for the Real Betis midfielder Víctor Camarasa. Palace have sold their full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for up to £50m and have turned down offers for the forward Wilfried Zaha from Everton and Arsenal. Roy Hodgson said last month Palace needed to add more players to their small squad having recruited only the goalkeeper Henderson and the forward Ayew in this transfer window. “Sporting director Doug Freedman and our chairman, Steve Parish, I know they are working hard to find the right people to bring in,” Hodgson said. “I’m confident that before the start of the season this squad will look bigger in terms of numbers and stronger in terms of the quality of player we bring in.”
