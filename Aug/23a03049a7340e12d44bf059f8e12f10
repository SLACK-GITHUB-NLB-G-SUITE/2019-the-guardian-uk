Jimmy Anderson bowled nine overs and took two wickets for Lancashire’s second team when he began his Ashes comeback attempt on Tuesday. The England seamer missed the second Test against Australia at Lord’s owing to a calf injury and bowled only four overs in the first Test at Edgbaston. The 37-year-old has already been ruled out of the third Test at Headingley on Thursday but hopes to be fit for the fourth at his home ground of Old Trafford, beginning on 4 September. Anderson began his quest to return in the more sedate atmosphere of a second XI friendly against Leicestershire at the Northern Club in Great Crosby, Liverpool. Watched by Ben Langley, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s lead physiotherapist, on the first day of a three-day match, Anderson bowled a spell in each of the first two sessions. He bowled five overs below his regular pace before lunch and took the wicket of Sam Bates, caught behind. He stepped up slightly after the break and bowled a further four overs, during which he trapped Ben Mike lbw. Anderson spent most of the rest of the innings, which ended soon after tea, fielding at first slip. He was not required to bat as Lancashire began their reply. Anderson, England’s leading Test wicket-taker with 575 victims, will not feature on the second day because he will return to Old Trafford for a recovery and fitness session. He is expected to return for the final day on Thursday. Chris Benbow, the Lancashire second-team coach, said: “He’s fine, he’s happy. He had an allotted spell of overs he wanted to bowl over the course of the three days. Ben Langley and [Lancashire physiotherapist] Dave Roberts are happy with how he’s gone. He’s moving well and he feels all right.”
