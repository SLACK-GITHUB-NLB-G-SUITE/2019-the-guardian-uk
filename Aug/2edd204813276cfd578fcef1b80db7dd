Check your ballsYellow balls are pressurised at 100%, which makes them heavy, hard, fast and difficult to control. Beginners should try orange or green balls, which are pressurised at 50% and 75% respectively. Remember the three RsReady: you should always be on the balls of your feet, and alert. Read: you must “read” the ball by following its course and gauging its speed, angle and height. React: position yourself to best react to the ball. For example, if the ball was hit deep, you may need to move back. Stay balancedBeginners tend to frantically run to hit the ball and carry on running as they hit it off-balance. It is key to maintain balance throughout making a shot. When running to the ball, stop and steady yourself before making your shot. Practise makes perfectThe best way to learn is through playing the game competitively. Match play is a top tip even for good players, as it most clearly shows you where you need to improve. • As told to Zainab Saleem. Sam Richardson in senior programmes manager at the LTA.
