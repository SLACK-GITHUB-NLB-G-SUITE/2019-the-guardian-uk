Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has urged easyHotel shareholders to reject a near-£139m offer for the budget hotel chain he founded because he says the bid is too low. EasyHotel’s board has accepted a cash offer for the company from Ivanhoé Cambridge, a Canadian real estate investor, and Icamap, a property fund. The 95p-a-share offer is worth about 35% more than easyHotel’s closing price on Friday and values the company at £138.7m. Haji-Ioannou owns 27% of easyHotel through his easyGroup investment company, which also oversees his stake in easyJet and other ventures. He launched easyHotel in 2004 and has a 34% stake in easyJet worth about £1.2bn. He said: “I find the offer from Icamap to be very low and I urge all other shareholders to take no action (ie not accept the Icamap offer) until the true value and future potential of easyHotel can be evaluated.” Icamap owns 38.65% of easyHotel and is the Aim-traded company’s biggest shareholder. Haji-Ioannou said Icamap paid 110p a share when easyHotel raised funds 18 months ago and that the stock reached 128p 15 months ago. EasyHotel owns 12 hotels and has another 26 franchised sites, with 17 more in development. Its operations span the UK, Europe and Dubai. The company, which describes itself as an “ultra-budget” hotel operator, floated on the stock market in 2014. Ivanhoé Cambridge and Icamap said easyHotel’s ownership structure makes its shares difficult to trade and restricts the company’s ability to raise the capital needed for expansion. Haji-Ioannou’s opposition to the offer is the latest in a series of disagreements he has had with the management of companies he founded. He has had several disputes with the board of easyJet and in 2016 objected to high director pay at easyHotel. Harm Meijer, the managing director of Icamap Advisory, said: “Our offer enables shareholders to exit from an illiquid stock at a 34.8% premium and, we believe, will result in greater clarity of ownership and direction for the company and its management team.” The bidders said they were open-minded about whether they take the company private or invest in it as a public company. The offer requires them to own at least 50% of the shares. In May, easyHotel posted a first-half loss of £120,000, which it blamed on the temporary closure of its hotel in Old Street, London, and higher depreciation in the value of new hotels. The company said the outlook for the hotel business was uncertain, particularly in the UK, where Brexit was affecting confidence. EasyHotel shares rose 35% to 94.5p in late morning trading on Monday. Before the bid was announced they had fallen to 70.5p from 115.5p in the past year.
