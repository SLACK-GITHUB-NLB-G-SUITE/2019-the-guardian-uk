Ajax booked their place in the Champions League group stage with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Apoel Nicosia in Amsterdam. After a goalless draw in Cyprus last week, last season’s semi-finalists calmed their nerves with a goal from Edson Álvarez two minutes before the break and then, with Apoel still knowing that an away goal could send them through, Dusan Tadic made it safe with a superb individual strike 10 minutes from the end. Second-leg home advantage also proved important for Club Brugge and Slavia Prague as they followed Ajax through. Brugge, 1-0 up from the first leg, beat Lask Linz 2-1 although they were made to fight for it. Hans Vanaken put them ahead with a 70th minute header but Klauss’s quick response from the penalty spot put the tie on a knife edge. The away side’s captain, Gernot Trauner, was then sent off for a second yellow card and Emmanuel Bonaventure converted a late goal on the break to make absolutely sure of Brugge’s progress.
