Manchester United and Internazionale will resume talks on Monday in an effort to finalise Alexis Sánchez’s loan move to the Serie A club. The clubs will stay in contact this weekend, and the key matter to be resolved relates to the proportion of the forward’s £390,000-a-week salary to be paid by Inter. Sánchez is ready to make the switch to Antonio Conte’s Inter, but United want the Italian club to pay around €6m (£5.5m) of his £20m-plus annual earnings. The Italians are holding out to pay about €3m. There is expectation that this final hurdle will be overcome and Sánchez will join his former United teammate Romelu Lukaku at Inter this coming week. One potential stumbling block is if one of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s forwards is injured before the move is completed.
