Greek police have arrested about 100 people in dawn raids on squats in Athens, the state news agency AMNA has reported. Dozens of officers cleared four sites that had been occupied for several weeks, mainly by refugees and migrants, in the Exarcheia neighbourhood of the capital. The conservative government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who took office as prime minister last month, has vowed to bring “order” to the district, promising regular police patrols. The neighbourhood has often been the site of clashes between anarchists and the police, particularly since 2008, when a teenager was shot dead by an officer, causing days of rioting. Kostas Bakoyannis, the new mayor of Athens, who was sworn in on Sunday, has pledged to make security his highest priority. Bakoyannis has accused the previous leftist government of having taken a soft line against vandalism by some anarchist groups.
