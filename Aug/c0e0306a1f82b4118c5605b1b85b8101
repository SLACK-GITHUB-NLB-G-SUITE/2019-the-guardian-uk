Zinedine Zidane is ready to put his faith in Gareth Bale as the forward suddenly looks set to stay at Real Madrid. Bale was omitted from the Real squad for a friendly with RB Salzburg, having also missed the club’s trip to Germany for the Audi Cup. That came after the collapse of Bale’s proposed transfer to the Chinese club Jiangsu Suning amid widespread speculation his six-year stay in Madrid was about to end. Bale reportedly skipped the trip to Germany, where Real played Tottenham and Fenerbahce, because he was furious with his treatment at the hands of Zidane and the club’s president, Florentino Pérez, and felt he was not in the right frame of mind to play. Zidane seems to have changed his mind about the Welshman. “It seemed Bale was going to leave but today he is here with us,” he said in a press conference before Real’s opening La Liga match against Celta Vigo. “The dynamics are changing, things are changing. From now on I will rely on him as on others. “I will rely on all the players who are here. He has his place, he is an important player and I hope all the players will make the task of choosing a team difficult.” Zidane was dealt a blow when the former Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard was ruled out for several weeks with a thigh injury. An update on Real’s website said: “Following tests carried out after training today, Eden Hazard has been diagnosed by the Real Madrid medical team with a lesion in the recto anterior muscle of the left thigh. Pending evaluation.”
