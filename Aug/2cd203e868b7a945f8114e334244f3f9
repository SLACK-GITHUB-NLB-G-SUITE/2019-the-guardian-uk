Sir Nicholas Serota asks “What makes a town thrive?” (Why the arts can lead the revival of Britain’s towns, 26 August), but while he rightly points to the role a theatre, gallery or library can play, he neglects to mention the community self-esteem generated by the culture and creativity people choose to practise themselves, in their own time, at their own expense. There are about 60,000 amateur arts groups in the UK, involving more than 10 million people. Through the annual Epic awards scheme, supported by Arts Council England since 2010, Voluntary Arts highlights the incredible achievements of groups led by volunteers who are transforming their communities. The Get Creative campaign, which is run by a group of cultural organisations including Voluntary Arts, the BBC and Arts Council England, celebrates and supports the everyday creativity happening in homes and public spaces across the UK through the annual Get Creative Festival, but Nicholas Serota neglects to mention this.Arts Council England’s draft new strategy emphasises the importance of people participating in creative activities in our communities, but Nicholas Serota’s article neglects to mention this. It is wonderful that Arts Council England recognises the previously unsung role played in communities by of theamateur arts – but please sing a little louder.Robin SimpsonChief executive, Voluntary Arts • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
