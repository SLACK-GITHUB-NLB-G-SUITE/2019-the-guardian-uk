Billy Vunipola has warned that England must learn how to produce their Twickenham form away from home to be considered genuine World Cup contenders in Japan. England’s record-breaking victory over Ireland on Saturday has sent expectations soaring just a few weeks before the World Cup starts but Vunipola says there is “massive scope” to improve on the road. Eddie Jones immediately sought to temper expectations after his side’s eight-try victory, instructing his players to “avoid the noise” and he will aim to keep their feet on the ground by putting them through a gruelling “pre-season” in Treviso when, on Wednesday, England return to Italy for another warm-weather training camp. England have won 22 of their 24 Tests at Twickenham under Jones and in their last two home matches they have scored a combined 90 points in big wins against Wales and Ireland. However, since beating Italy in Rome at the start of the 2018 Six Nations England have lost six of their eight away matches. “I would like to see that performance away from home,” Vunipola said. “That is the biggest thing for me. I have said it to Eddie in the changing rooms. It is something we need to start doing away from Twickenham. That is the biggest challenge next, going to Japan and doing it away from all our fans and the comforts of our home changing room. There is massive scope for us to improve. That is the biggest challenge for us. Now everyone is going to pump up our tyres because we did well this week, but it was only last week [after losing to Wales] that everyone was hammering us.” Jones was at least boosted by the fact that the 24-hour citing window passed on Sunday without any reprimands for his players. George Kruis received a yellow card in the final minute for a high tackle on Jack Carty and was fortunate to escape a red – the referee, Nigel Owens, choosing not to review the incident and determining that, according to World Rugby’s decision-making framework for high tackles, the threshold for a sending off was not met. The citing commissioner also opted against any further action. Jones recently launched into an unprovoked rant at World Rugby over refereeing inconsistencies after New Zealand’s Scott Barrett was shown a red card in the All Blacks’ heavy defeat by Australia. The Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, has expressed similar concerns. Jones added: “The high tackle is something that common sense has to be applied [to], otherwise we’re going to have a World Cup where it’s basically a lottery of how many players you have on the field.”
