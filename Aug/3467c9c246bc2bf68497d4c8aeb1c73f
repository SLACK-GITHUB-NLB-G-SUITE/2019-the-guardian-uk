The NBA suspended Brooklyn Nets forward Wilson Chandler for 25 games for violating the league’s anti-drug program. The league said Thursday that Chandler tested positive for Ipamorelin, a growth hormone-releasing peptide. Chandler, 32, signed a one-year deal with the Nets in July for the $2.6m veteran’s minimum. The 6ft 9in veteran split last season with the Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Clippers, averaging 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds in 51 games (33 starts). A first-round pick of the New York Knicks in 2007, Chandler also spent six and a half seasons with the Denver Nuggets. In 641 career games (480 starts), he has averaged 12.9 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per contest.
