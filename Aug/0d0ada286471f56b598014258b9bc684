Diageo has bought the “game-changing” non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip, adding it to a drinks cupboard that includes Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. The drinks company bought 20% of Seedlip in 2016 through its Distill Ventures division, which invests in small businesses it believes have the potential to make a splash in the industry. It has now increased its share to take a majority stake, in a deal whose value was not disclosed, but its existing assets and rapid growth indicate that its founder, Ben Branson, will have made millions by a sizeable chunk of the 80% stake he owned. So far, Distill Ventures has invested more than £60m in about 15 drinks brands. Four years after Branson began making the distilled but non-alcoholic drink in his kitchen, Seedlip is served in more than 7,500 outlets in 25 countries, including more than 300 Michelin-starred restaurants. “We want to change the way the world drinks and today’s news is another big step forward to achieving this,” said Branson, who produces three versions of the spice-based drink. John Kennedy, Diageo’s president of Europe, Turkey and India, said the brand was “game-changing” and was likely to be a global drinks giant of the future. Drinks companies have been responding to changing tastes, particularly among younger people, a growing number of whom do not drink or do so only in small quantities. Teetotalism in Britain increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2005 for those aged between 16 and 24, according to a 2018 report from the Office for National Statistics. As sales of alcoholic drinks have slowed, many manufacturers have been introducing lower-strength beers or even wines, while others have produced drinks designed to mimic the role played by spirits in cocktails.
