Given all the uncertainty of opening day fixtures, Burnley at least provide some predictability. Deadline day signing Danny Drinkwater is unlikely to play given his lack of first team action in the past year, but returning local boy Jay Rodriguez should feature up front alongside Ashley Barnes. Elsewhere all will be as it was last season, in terms of personnel at least, though Sean Dyche will expect his team’s form to surpass 2018’s dismal start. For Saints Ralph Hasenhüttl could start new signings Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo, with £15m Adams expected to partner Danny Ings who made his move to the south coast permanent this summer.
