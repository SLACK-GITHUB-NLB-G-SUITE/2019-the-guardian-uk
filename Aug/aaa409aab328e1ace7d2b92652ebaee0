Thanks to Dorian Lynskey for the thoughtful piece on political novels (Review, 24 August). One issue is that contemporary politics is dual: the major issues of our time, including climate change, gender, nationalism, sexuality, ethnicity, race, immigration and labour exploitation, where culture and power are interwoven; and the formal politics of parliament and No 10. Many novels deal with the former (Anna Burns’ Milkman, Monica Ali’s Brick Lane, Linda Grant’s A Stranger City, for example). Not so the latter. The real challenge for the novelist is to link the two – to portray and advance discussion about how parliamentary laws and policies both reflect what powerful groups want and shape our lives as individuals, and about how we live our lives to advance positive or negative change. Perhaps Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire, John Lanchester’s Capital or my own Ardent Justice do this, but there are relatively few other examples. One possible explanation of the decline of the political novel is that the totalitarianism that Orwell or Koestler or Solzhenistsyn were writing against unites formal and cultural politics, whereas now the gulf between Westminster gaming and the needs of our divided society is so great that it is an uphill struggle to link the two.Peter Taylor-GoobyCanterbury, Kent • With regard to Dorian Lynskey’s article and the subsequent suggestion by Penny Driscoll that Nineteen Eighty-Four is still the political novel of our times (Letters, 26 August), surely It Can’t Happen Here by Nobel prize writer Sinclair Lewis is worthy of a mention. Written in 1935, the brilliantly told story of a US politician who “promises that he will make America proud and prosperous once more” and whose populist rightwing rhetoric leads to his election as president and to an authoritarian, anti-immigrant and tyrannical regime, has an uncanny and frightening prescience.Doug SandleLeeds • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
