250ml, £2, ocado.comWow! A good balance between acidity, sweetness, mint and alcohol. A really delicious mojito. Multi-layered, I’m even getting the caramel rum flavour. My favourite by a mile. ★★★★ 250ml, £1, morrisons.comThis has an overwhelming minty flavour, very sweet. It has a natural mint flavour, though. Not enough acidity and I can’t taste the alcohol.★ 250ml, £2, marksandspencer.comThis feels more alcoholic than the rest, and lacks acidity. Really boozy. Good rum flavour, though … rum and caramel are the overriding flavours.★ 250ml, £1.80, ocado.comUrgh! Is this a mojito? There’s nothing mojito about it. It has an astringent mint-like flavour. I can’t taste the alcohol.★ 250ml, £5.99, selfridges.comDry and sharp. Very pale, with a nice fizz. There’s a white wine tinge to the flavour. My favourite of the bunch.★★★★ 200ml, £2.25, sainsburys.comIt’s got very fine bubbles, it’s very viscous. This tastes the most refined and big-bodied of the bunch ... it tastes expensive.★★★★ 200ml, £1.69, aldi.co.ukVery berry ... strawberry and apricot notes. Rounded, with body. But it has an iron aftertaste, almost like the can.★★★ 200ml, £2, asda.comDark in colour. Very sweet. It’s like it has a slight vanilla tinge to it. Big rosé flavour. It’s got very big bubbles, tastes overly carbonated.★★ 250ml, £3.49, waitrose.comThis has got the lightness I look for in a rosé and something interesting going on behind it. This is quite nice. Seems alcoholic for a rosé, though.★★★ 250ml, £2.50, sainsburys.comReally watery, it doesn’t taste of anything. This would be OK over ice. It’s not exciting, but a rosé everyone wants to drink.★★★ 250ml, £2.80, waitrose.comI am really getting the can flavour, it’s a strange, overwhelming taste on the first sip. Insipid, bitter. I’d almost put this in a cocktail. It’s characterless, no va va voom.★★ 250ml, £2.80, sainsburys.comThis is really acrid, very tinny tasting; it almost tastes like blood. I hate it ... I winced when I tried it.0 stars 250ml, £2.75, ocado.comThis tastes like a solid pub G&T. This is something I would buy. It’s got sweetness and body, it’s dry but not drying, and there’s citrus, too.I’m getting the traditional London gin flavour.★★★★ 250ml, £1.50, morrisons.comThis has a lot of flavour ... it’s acidic, there’s a lot of citrus and a good balance of sweetness. It has a citrus-elderflower backbone ... a nice flavour that is the sweet fruit side of herbal, rather than herbal-floral.★★★ 250ml, £2, marksandspencer.comSmells more of gin than tonic … the aroma is juniper over everything else. I’m getting tannins from the quinine. It will do for a quick drink on your way home.★★★ 250ml, £1.80, ocado.comI’m not getting much smell from this. It doesn’t taste gin-y at all. I can’t tell if it’s got anything jazzy going on. A very sweet gin and tonic … lemonade-y almost. Definitely been masterminded for someone with a sweet tooth.★★ 250ml, £1, tesco.comIt’s got a real citrus backbone to it. Definitely got the dryness … a really crisp flavour. I like the quinine and juniper. Nice.★★★★ 250ml, £2.75, ocado.comThis tastes the most alcoholic of the lot, a lot more quinine flavour and dryness than the rest. I like this, the flavour lingers. It’s a decent gin and tonic.★★★ 250ml, £1, sainsburys.comReally fizzy, fine bubbles hit your throat before your palate. Maybe a bit alarmingly fizzy. Inoffensive, it’s not giving me any kicks.★★ 250ml, 85p, aldi.co.ukIt’s really lacklustre and is certainly a diet product … it tastes like sweetener to me. It’s not got much going for it. It just tastes like a sweet, slightly alcoholic drink.★ 250ml, £2, marksandspencer.comThis is dry, there is acidity and a gin hit. It’s got that bittery-sweetness, with a tiny bit of fruit at the back. Head and shoulders above the others, more adult in flavour.★★★ 250ml, 85p, aldi.co.ukI feel like I’m on the dancefloor of a trashy nightclub … it’s not classy-tasting, but is certainly not as sweet as some others.★ 250ml, £1.50, morrisons.comIt has an OK quinine flavour. It’s still very sweet, though. I can’t taste the gin, although there is an alcohol flavour at the back. Pretty disgusting.★ 250ml, £1.80, ocado.comIt smells like the Mr Men ice lollies from the 80s. This is the alcopop for grownups. You can taste the gin for sure.0 stars All products are blind-tested
