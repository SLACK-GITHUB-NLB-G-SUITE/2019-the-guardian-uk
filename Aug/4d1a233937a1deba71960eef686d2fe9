The audience has assembled, but sketch duo Goodbear haven’t shown up. So what’s a duty manager to do? Kill time, of course – which front-of-house boss Joe and underling Henry proceed to do, with the help of technician Dougal, supplying gun sound effects. One thing leads to another and Joe and Henry start competing for the spotlight. Who needs Goodbear? With Dougal orchestrating son et lumière, Joe and Henry submit themselves to sketch comedy – capably enough that Goodbear themselves (AKA Joe Barnes and Henry Perryment) might worry they’ll be elbowed out of their own starring roles. It’s a winning conceit for a sketch show, sustained throughout, as comic scenarios alternate with the here-and-now of venue staff Joe and Henry, covering for the absent pros. If I have a quibble, it’s that the story of these two accidental comics doesn’t really go anywhere; it’s only ever a playful framing device. Happily, the sketches are usually fun enough to compensate, as a mortally wounded soldier begs a comrade to deliver his last letter home, and two grooming monkeys bitch about fellow members of the troop. The sketches are seldom either sequential or consequential, so stand or fall on their own comic merits. Stand in the case of a faux-tender number about a son (or is he?) returning from war. Fall in the case of skits about a chef, a 19th-century ball and two fashion designer sisters. One or two fine scenes emerge from and scramble the show’s multiple realities, like the one set in Henry’s narcotic fantasia – or so we think. And they all spin out of one another with impressive fluidity – usually at Dougal’s bidding. It’s a smart show: these front-of-house boys should be given their own show forthwith. • At Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 August. • Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews
