Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My parents, in their late 80s, are struggling with life on their own. We help, but can only call by two or three times a week. They’re moderately well off and we’re researching a homecare package for them. We could go with one of the care companies, but people say they send different people each day. How do we find independent carers? How much should we pay? How often should they come? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
