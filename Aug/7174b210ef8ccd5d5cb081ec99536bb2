Paris Saint-Germain’s Ligue 1 game away to Metz was temporarily halted on Friday after another incident of homophobia in French football. The referee paused play in the 20th minute after Metz fans held banners deemed to be of a homophobic nature. Players were taken off the pitch but play was resumed a few minutes later. The incident comes after Nice’s game at home to Marseille on Wednesday was suspended for 10 minutes after fans displayed homophobic banners and homophobic chants were heard. Play was also stopped for a few minutes in a Ligue 2 game between Nancy and Le Mans this month for similar incidents and during Monaco’s 2-2 draw with Nîmes last Sunday. The French league has pledged to clamp down on homophobic chanting this season, with referees instructed to stop play if insults of a homophobic nature are heard. Two banners were pictured at the Stade Saint-Symphorien, the first of which said “PSG, LFP [Ligue 1], let me sing to you, to tell you to go fuck yourselves! I won’t be on TV, because my words are not very gay.” A second banner referenced the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investments, a Doha-based fund with links to the Qatari royal family. PSG won the match 2-0, with first-half goals from Ángel Di Maria and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who was forced off with injury late in the game.
