Fulham have launched an investigation after their defender Cyrus Christie alleged two supporters hit and racially abused his sister during the club’s 1-0 opening-day defeat against Barnsley at Oakwell. “To the Fulham fan that decided to hit my sister at the game today and his wife who justified his action with racist remarks I hope your proud of yourself and feel like a big man,” Christie said on Twitter. “You’ll get what’s coming to you. Regardless how you felt about the result your actions are shameful.” Fulham say they will take strong action if the culprits can be found. “Fulham Football Club is investigating an incident which took place in the away end at the Barnsley v Fulham fixture this afternoon,” said the club in a statement. “Should the perpetrators be identified, the Club will be taking the strongest possible action.” The incident capped a miserable start to life back in the Championship for the London club, who slipped to defeat thanks to Luke Thomas’s brilliant first-half solo goal for Barnsley. “I’m bitterly disappointed,” said the Fulham manager, Scott Parker, who was speaking before Christie’s allegations came to light. “We knew it was going to be a tough battle in the first game of the season, which it proved to be. “We understand what league it is that we’re in. We have players that have already been in this division and they understand what it’s like. “Every game in this league is going to be a challenge and the rest of the games will be the same.” Barnsley’s head coach, Daniel Stendel, handed out praise following his side’s win: “I’m very happy about the result but more about the performance today. We knew that Fulham have a good squad but, if we played with more conviction, we had a chance to win this game. “I’m a little surprised, with it being the first game in the Championship and having so many new faces who are also very young, but we played so good.”
