Miley Cyrus claims she was fired from children’s animation Hotel Transylvania after posing with a penis-shaped cake purchased for her then-boyfriend’s birthday. Listing a series of her lowest points on Twitter on Thursday, Cyrus – who started her career as a Disney Channel star – said she was “kicked off Hotel Transylvania for buying Liam a penis cake and licking it”. I got kicked off hotel Transylvania for buying Liam a penis cake for his birthday and licking it. A Sony source has apparently confirmed the story to the Hollywood Reporter, saying executives were concerned about Cyrus’s radical departure from the wholesome image presented on long-running show Hannah Montana, as well as in a clutch of tween-friendly films. Cyrus was fired from the film – which spawned a lucrative franchise, whose fourth instalment is due next year – in February 2012. She had been set to play the daughter of Adam Sandler’s Dracula, a role that was eventually played by Selena Gomez. Earlier this month, comedian Sarah Silverman spoke about being fired from a recent film the night before shooting was due to begin after producers saw a decade-old photo of the actor wearing blackface for a comedy sketch.
