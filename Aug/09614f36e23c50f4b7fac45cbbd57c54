Before his appearance in Wednesday night’s second round of the Democratic debates, Joe Biden had a big announcement. “I’ve got some exciting news: I am now on Snapchat!” the party’s 2020 frontrunner revealed on Twitter. His opening Snaps feature photos of him eating ice cream and donning his signature Ray-Bans, and Bitmojis of him eating ice cream and donning Ray-Bans, and – you get the picture. He even released an aviator Snapchat filter in Detroit, prior to the debate. But the move has been met with some skepticism among journalists and supporters wondering if “Uncle Joe” is trying a bit too hard to appeal to young people. Ahead of tonight’s debate, Biden makes an appeal for The Youngs 👇 https://t.co/LtHCpGLNg3 Indeed, as Biden took the stage for the debate, his Gen Z granddaughter Finnegan Biden was snapping behind-the-scenes content. How’re you doing fellow kids — fellow youths of a similar disposition?! I, too, am “with it.” https://t.co/sbqQXu73cW I've never known anything as surely in my life as I know that Joe Biden calls snapchat "the snapchat" https://t.co/KlLhqkY5Re Biden isn’t the only 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on Snapchat, though he’s arguably made the splashiest debut. Kirsten Gillibrand has been promoting her policy proposals on the social media platform, including her plan to tackle climate change. Kamala Harris’s account has featured many of her family members, including her niece, sister and brother-in-law. And Bill de Blasio has also been snapping pre-debate scenes, including a dazzling shot of the sink in the green room. I’m so glad I rejoined Snapchat so I could get these v. important updates from all the Dem candidates pic.twitter.com/iIJa6hW1CT Despite the snark, Biden’s efforts may not be misplaced – even prior to joining Snapchat, he was the leading candidate among daily Snapchat users, according to a Morning Consult poll from May. With 30% support, the former vice-president just edged out Bernie Sanders, whose snaps from last night featured a message of support from the Lethal Weapon actor Danny Glover.
