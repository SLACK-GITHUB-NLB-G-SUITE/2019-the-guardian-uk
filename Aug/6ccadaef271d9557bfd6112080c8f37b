Peel and roughly chop 400g of carrots. Bring 500ml of water to the boil, add the carrots and cook until the carrots are completely tender. Tip the carrots and their liquid into a blender, add 30g of butter and process to a thick cream. Peel and finely chop 1 large shallot and 2 cloves of garlic. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil in a deep-sided pan and add the shallot and garlic. Sauté for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly, then tip in 300g of arborio rice. Stir, then pour in 600ml of hot vegetable stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously until each ladle of stock has been absorbed by the rice. Continue until all the liquid has been used and you have a creamy texture. Remove from the heat. Finely slice a small bulb of fennel. Finely dice 100g of small, young carrots, then sauté for 2 or 3 minutes in a little olive oil. Meanwhile, finely shred 6 radishes, then add to the carrots and fennel. Spoon the rice into shallow bowls, add the lightly cooked vegetables and serve. Enough for 2. Take your time adding the hot stock. Nothing good will come from introducing it all at once. Stir almost constantly, adding the stock by the ladleful and stirring until it has been absorbed and the rice has a soft and creamy texture. I love the contrast in texture between the soft, creamy rice and the crisp vegetables. You could introduce any seasonal vegetables in place of the carrots and radishes, such as chopped, lightly cooked peas or climbing beans.
