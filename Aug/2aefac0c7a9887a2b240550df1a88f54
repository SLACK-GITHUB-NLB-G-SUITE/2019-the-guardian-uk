More often than not, I’m rewatching Wanda Sykes’s I’ma Be Me. To me, it’s a flawless 87 minutes. I’ve watched it probably about 10 times and laugh just as hard with each viewing. Anything from In Living Color. Iconic series that doesn’t get enough love for how impactful and insanely and routinely hilarious it was. Industry person: Vanessa Bayer; non-industry: my boyfriend. None of them. They’re all trash and deleted from my memory as soon as the show is over. When I permed my hair, it was super-straight and lifeless and then [I had] these bangs that I would curl overnight with rollers. I looked like a child civil rights marcher, but not as put-together. I used to love the Oprah show and how she would reward hard-working people with houses or cars or whatever. I had a dream I wrote a letter to her about how amazing I was as a teenager (spoiler alert: I wasn’t) and she rewarded me with Ricky Martin coming to my high school to perform a special concert for me during lunch. With the right inflection, the “B” word. Phoebe Robinson is at Assembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, Monday 12 to 25 August
