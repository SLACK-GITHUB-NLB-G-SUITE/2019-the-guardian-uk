Earlier this week, former England rugby union player Ben Foden announced that he had married his girlfriend, entrepreneur Jackie Belanoff-Smith, after just two weeks of dating. In a heartfelt Instagram post, showing pictures of the couple beaming on a boat at sunset, Foden gushed about his love for Belanoff-Smith. “People will say we are mad or crazy or even fools ... But when someone like her comes in to your life, why would I wait?” Foden also thanked his ex-wife, singer Una Healy of the Saturdays – with whom he has two children – for giving the union her blessing. This last year has been by far my toughest and most turbulent for a number of reasons that many of you I’m sure are aware of, in some way or another. The world has a funny way of working things out, many people think I’m a bad person - as I’m sure they’ll be many nasty comments left under this post by keyboard warriors a plenty. But I met a girl who seriously swept me off my feet and in a time of hardship showed me love, a deep devoted love. People will say we are mad or crazy or even fools, as @snackyjax and I had only been dating seriously for a little over 2 weeks before deciding to get married. But when someone like her comes in to your life, why would I wait? 🤷🏻‍♂️ The people who needed to know, such as close family and friends were told before anyone else and they are happy for me including my beautiful X wife @unahealy who I love even more for her blessing. Life is short and you only get one and it’s worth living. Jackie is the greatest human being I’ve ever come across - she’s beautiful inside and out, intelligent, charming, funny, generous, kind, gentle, energetic the list goes on. 😊 She will be a great step mum to Aoife and Tadhg and offers me a future I can’t wait to explore with her. My heart is full and I honestly couldn’t be happier, so those that want to bring negativity or try and tear me down go ahead. My life is great and I hope you all will one day feel happiness like i feel while I write this caption. I love you @snackyjax I can’t wait to see where our lives lead together you brought excitement and joy to my life and I couldn’t be prouder having stand at my side as Mrs Foden. (BTW the witness is Jackie’s sister @leila.bela thanks you too hun for being a legend) #Love A post shared by  Ben Foden (@ben_foden) on Aug 6, 2019 at 5:45am PDT Can a relationship in which both parties have known each other for less time than I have been meaning to take the recycling out really go the distance? “It is very rare that we see people marrying this quickly,” says Professor Brienna Perelli-Harris of the University of Southampton, an expert on demographic trends in marriage and cohabitation. Typically couples that wed after such a brief courtship do so because of pressing external factors: because one partner is being posted abroad in the military, terminal illness, or “financial benefits of some sort”, says Perelli-Harris. Foden and Belanoff-Smith are an example of what she terms “direct marriage”, in which two people wed before having cohabited. Since the 1990s, this has become increasingly rare: 70% of modern couples now live together before getting married. (Those who don’t may not do so for cultural reasons, such as in the case of many arranged marriages.) “People are becoming more uncertain about their relationships, because they see that so many marriages have ended in divorce, including maybe their own parents’, so they don’t want to rush into it.” Cohabitation is an important stress test, says Perelli-Harris. “The previous research used to show that premarital cohabitation was bad for relationships and that people were more likely to break up if they lived together before getting married, but that has pretty much gone away.” Most couples will either get married or break up within three years of moving in together, following what demographic researchers call a “trial period”. “People in our focus groups use terms like, ‘try before you buy’,” she says So does Perelli-Harris think a marriage after two weeks of dating could really work? “We know that couples who have lived together longer are less likely to dissolve their relationships.” Meaning that Foden and Belanoff-Smith are probably not going to grow old together? “I would guess that’s the case,” she says, apologetically. Now, to take out the recycling.
