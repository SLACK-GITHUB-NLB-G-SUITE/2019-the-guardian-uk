There is a familiar feel to the betting for the Golden Mile Handicap at Goodwood on Friday afternoon thanks to the presence of David O’Meara’s Escobar towards the top of the market, and he is worth backing at around 8-1 in the hope that he enjoys more luck than he did 12 months ago. Escobar travelled like a winner from the start to the furlong pole, where he was stopped in his tracks when attempting to find a gap. By the time he did find running room, it was too late to make any impression but he was still beaten less than four lengths. Mojito, who beat Escobar in a hot race at Sandown in early July, will be a popular pick with Frankie Dettori taking the ride but Escobar (3.00) looked back to his very best when recording a comfortable success at York last time out and Jamie Spencer is the right jockey to deliver him on the line. Goodwood 1.50 A big field goes to post for this Group Three contest for fillies and mares but plenty look like very optimistic entries and it is hard to see past Sir Michael Stoute’s Jubiloso. A half-sister to the brilliant Frankel, Jubiloso was sent off as a 9-2 chance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot last time out when making only the third start of her career. A third place finish was commendable given her inexperience and it will be a real disappointment if she cannot regain the winning thread here. Goodwood 2.25 Turgenev will long be remembered for his near-miss in the Britannia Stakes at Royal Ascot when Frankie Dettori was looking for a five-timer, and his slightly disappointing run at Newmarket’s July meeting may have been a reaction to that huge effort in mid-June. This does not look like the strongest Group Three of the week and while Duke Of Hazzard is on the upgrade, anything close to Turgenev’s Ascot form would probably be enough. Goodwood 3.35 The enigmatic Battaash still has only a single Group One win to his name despite often looking like the fastest horse on the planet through the first four furlongs of his races. He came up short once again when second to Blue Point in the King’s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot last time out but the lightning-fast five furlongs at Goodwood suits him perfectly and it will be a huge shock if he cannot win this race for the third year running.
