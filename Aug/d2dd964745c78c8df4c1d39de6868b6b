It is, quite literally, a cheesy pun. And it’s gained Marc Simpson the title of Scotland’s funniest tweet at this year’s Edinburgh fringe. Fighting off competition from other shortlisted Scots, Simpson’s prize-winning tweet reads: “wis walkin home n someone threw a block of cheese oot their windee n it hit me on the head, i turned n shouted that wisna very mature wis it” It was enough to impress the judges, Scottish comedians Fern Brady, Mark Nelson, Janey Godley and Ray Bradshaw, with Brady calling it “the Twitter equivalent of being heckled. Brilliant!” The judges chose Simpson’s gag from a shortlist picked by Twitter from the comedic observations referred to as Scottish Twitter. Other shortlisted entries included: Fucking class having a shower at your girlfriends. Using stuff like a charcoal facial scrub and a pomegranate & mango shower milk, I’ve came out the shower smelling like a fresh fruit market on a hot summers day, feeling like a brand new woman. 13/10 would recommend. Mental that yer nipples are older than yer teeth A twirls just a flake wae a jacket oan Speaking about his win, Simpson told the Guardian: “I am lost for words. I never win anything, so to officially have Scotland’s funniest tweet … I’m buzzing. I have a child on the way, so they’ll be proud to know their old boy has this award.” Simpson will receive a trophy and a wall of honour in the temporary #ScottishTwitter visitor centre, which features tweets reimagined as oil paintings and a stained glass window of Glaswegian singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi. Dara Nasr, managing director of Twitter UK, said: “There were genuine lols in the office as we delved into the Scottish Twitter conversations – we’re so proud to open the visitor centre as a celebration of the insightful, frank and even philosophical humour of Scottish Twitter.”
