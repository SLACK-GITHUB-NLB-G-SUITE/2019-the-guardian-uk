Israel Folau and Rugby Australia could face a February 2020 trial if they fail to resolve a multimillion-dollar unfair dismissal case brought by the former Wallabies player and staunch Christian. Folau’s lawyer, Stuart Wood QC, faced the federal circuit court in Melbourne on Tuesday for a directions hearing, during which chief judge Will Alstergren encouraged the parties to settle their dispute through mediation on 13 December. If mediation fails, Folau will fight Rugby Australia and the NSW Waratahs at a three- to five-day trial from 4 February. Folau wants an apology, $10m in damages and his contract reinstated by his former employers, claiming he was sacked on religious grounds after his April Instagram post about gay people and others going to hell unless they repented. Folau was not at Tuesday’s hearing, which was live-streamed to Sydney. Lawyers for Rugby Australia indicated they might apply for the case to be heard by the federal court of Australia rather than the federal circuit court, and to have the case transferred to Sydney. Wood said that was an attempt to delay proceedings and he wanted Alstergren to be aware of “what’s going on in the background”. The allegation was denied by Rugby Australia’s lawyer, Adam Hochroth. If mediation is unsuccessful, the parties will return to court on 17 December or a directions hearing ahead of trial.
