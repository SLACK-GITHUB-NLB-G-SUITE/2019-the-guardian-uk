Eddie Nketiah is already making an impact at Leeds, the on-loan Arsenal striker scoring his second goal for the club to seal a 1-0 home win over Brentford and take them back to the top of the Championship. Brentford’s defence, featuring the former Leeds centre-half Pontus Jansson, had held firm until the 81st minute when Nketiah converted from close range following Hélder Costa’s cross. Steve Cooper’s promising start to his tenure as Swansea manager, continued in a 3-1 win at Queens Park Rangers that lifted them to second place. Bersant Celina put the visitors ahead, firing home in the 29th minute after a swift counterattack. Jordan Hugill equalised on 66 minutes with a firm downward header but Swansea were swiftly back in front when Borja Bastón converted from the penalty spot after Yoann Barbet fouled Jordan Garrick. Sam Surridge’s headed third put the outcome beyond doubt. Charlton, another of the early front-runners, were pegged back by Albert Adomah’s 78th-minute goal for Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw at The Valley. Lyle Taylor had headed Charlton side in front from Jonathan Leko’s cross. Kenneth Zohore scored an 88th-minute penalty to rescue a point for West Brom at home to Reading. Ovie Ejaria’s stunning 71st-minute strike had put the visitors ahead. A late goal from Junior Hoilett brought Cardiff a 2-1 win over Huddersfield, ruining caretaker manager Mark Hudson’s first game in charge following Jan Siewert’s sacking last week. Trevor Chalobah had cancelled out Joe Ralls’s 42nd-minute opener for Cardiff before Hoilett sealed it on 88 minutes. Stoke remain bottom after going down 3-1 at Preston. First-half goals from Daniel Johnson, from distance, and Billy Bodin, whose shot squirmed under Jack Butland, set them on their way. Josh Harrop added a third in the second half before James McClean’s consolation.
