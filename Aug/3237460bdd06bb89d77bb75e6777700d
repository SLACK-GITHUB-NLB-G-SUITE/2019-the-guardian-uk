For an insight into local lives there’s nothing like rubbing shoulders with shoppers at a noisy market. This week we want to hear about your best experiences (and bargains) at weird and/or wonderful street and covered markets across the world – not UK ones this time. Maybe you’ve haggled in a north African souk, marvelled at the creatures on sale at fish stalls in Asia, or picked up a vintage gem at a flea market. Please give exact locations, websites if any, with details of times and how to get there, if appropriate. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 27 August 2019, 10am BST Read the terms and conditions If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
