Kylie Jenner, the Keeping up with the Kardashians reality TV star whose eponymous cosmetics empire has turned her into the world’s youngest billionaire, will this weekend spend more than £1m on a party to celebrate her 22nd birthday onboard a $126m (£104m) superyacht. Jenner has chartered the 91.5m (300ft) yacht Tranquility, which features a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, Turkish bath, an “experiential shower”, a cinema and helicopter landing pad, to party in the Mediterranean this weekend. Jenner, who has 143 million followers on Instagram, built her business on $29 Kylie Lip Kits, which promise “the perfect pout”. She arrived in Italy in usual billionaire style, flying in from Los Angeles by private jet before boarding the Tranquility from the picturesque village of Positano on Thursday. The yacht, the world’s 71st-largest, is described on its website as “the ultimate blend of luxury living and indulgent relaxation”. It costs €1.1m-a-week – “plus expenses” – to charter and has up to 29 crew to sail the boat and cater to the guests. Kylie’s contingent includes her rapper and music producer boyfriend, Travis Scott, 18-month-old daughter Stormi, her mother and “momager” Kris, and friends including the Hollywood actor Scott Disick and model Sofia Richie. The vessel quickly headed off to the exclusive island of Capri. As well as hosting an extravagant party for her birthday on Saturday, Jenner will also be launching a new product for the cosmetics empire, this time a “must-have” body powder.. My beautiful new Birthday Body Glow launches 8/10 ✨ i like to use this all over my body but it also looks amazing as a highlighter for your face! it’s a must have 😍💸 A post shared by  Kylie ✨ (@kyliejenner) on Aug 5, 2019 at 12:38pm PDT The party yacht, which was named yacht of the year at the World Superyacht Awards in 2014, was previously owned by Jho Low, a fugitive billionaire. Low is wanted by Malaysian and US authorities in connection with the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal. He is accused of using money from the Malaysian fund to buy a private jet, artworks by Van Gogh and Monet, homes in London, New York and California, and a rare 22-carat pink diamond necklace valued at $27.3m. He also helped finance Hollywood blockbuster, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Low denies all the charges, but his whereabouts are currently unknown. Malaysian authorities seized the yacht, which it claims Low bought with $250m of stolen government funds, last year and sold it to the casino operator Genting Malaysia for $126m. Genting is chartering out the yacht, previously called Equanimity, via British broker Camper & Nicholsons. This was a night to remember 😂 thank you @khloekardashian for joining me in my Get Ready with Me using my brand new @kyliecosmetics Bday Collection! https://t.co/DEHbV1R1bH pic.twitter.com/TAOuAzfu06 The broker describes the boat, fitted out by the billionaire’s designer of choice, Britain’s Andrew Winch, as “iconic” and “truly exceptional”. “An ocean-crossing world explorer, this iconic superyacht boasts a vast 20sq m swimming pool and accommodation for up to 22 guests,” the brochure states. “Guest facilities include a spectacular beach club which transitions through to a fully equipped gym boasting a large balcony on the starboard side allowing direct access to the sea, and an indulgent spa suite – complete with a sauna, Hammam [Turkish bath], experiential showers, plunge pool and a massage/treatment room.” Scott started the celebrations for Jenner’s birthday earlier this week by covering the hallway of her LA mansion in thousands of rose petals, and left a card saying “we’re just getting started. Happy Birthday.” In an Instagram caption she wrote: “This man covered my house in roses omg!” while his song “Wake up” from his album Astroworld played. My house is covered in ROSES! @travisscott and it’s not even my birthday yet!!!!! Omg ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😭😭😭😭 A post shared by  Kylie ✨ (@kyliejenner) on Aug 5, 2019 at 1:37pm PDT It is thought that Jenner’s birthday plans have been masterminded by wedding and party planning consultant Mindy Weiss, who has arranged other over-the-top celebrations for Jenner, including Stormi’s first birthday party. The event – christened StormiWorld – involved creating a whole theme park, which guests entered through a giant inflatable head of Stormi before walking through a corridor of fake clouds and rain – an apparent “storm”. i had to go all out for my baby. #StormiWorld A post shared by  Kylie ✨ (@kyliejenner) on Feb 9, 2019 at 6:59pm PST Stormi’s first birthday presents included a Chanel purse, given to her by Jenner’s chum DJ Khaled. In a video, filmed by Jenner, her mum is heard to say: “Oh Stormi! Your first Chanel.” Weiss also arranged Kris Jenner’s Gatsby-themed 60th birthday in 2015, an Alice in Wonderland-themed first birthday for Chicago West (the daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian), and Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday. She said arranging parties for the Kardashians was the favourite part of her job. “They’re all very creative. We’re so excited every time we get called to do one because they have their own ideas,” she told W magazine earlier this year. “Kanye being the most creative. He’s so visual and steps out of the box and he really inspires me, and he inspires the whole family.” Jenner is not the only billionaire sailing around the Med on a superyacht this summer. American billionaire media executive David Geffen has been posting regular updates on his holiday with a string of other other billionaires. Partying this week with Geffen on his $590m superyacht Rising Sun, sailing around Ibiza and the Balearics are Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, his new girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, former Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein, venture capitalist Joshua Kushner and his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss, and oil heir Mikey Hess.
