The first trailer has been released for Little Women, Greta Gerwig’s upcoming version of the Louisa May Alcott novel, which is set for release in December. The film is the eighth cinema adaptation of the tale, which is set in 1860s New England in the aftermath of the American Civil War and explores the lives of the March sisters. Gerwig reunites with her Lady Bird stars Saoirse Ronan (who plays Jo), Timothée Chalamet (Laurie) and Tracy Letts (who plays a publisher). Joining them are Meryl Streep as Aunt March, Laura Dern as Marmee and Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen as Meg, Amy and Beth. Sarah Polley was originally set to direct in 2016, but Gerwig was brought in as a replacement, and has redrafted Polley’s script. Watson replaces Emma Stone, who left for scheduling reasons. The film opens in the US on Christmas Day and in the UK on Boxing Day.
