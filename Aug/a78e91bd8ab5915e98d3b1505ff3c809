Sheffield United return to the Premier League for the first time since the 2006-07 season. New signing Oli McBurnie is likely to start as a lone striker for Chris Wilderâ€™s side. Bournemouth start the season with a long injury list but will be confident their new arrivals and experience can guide them to victory.
