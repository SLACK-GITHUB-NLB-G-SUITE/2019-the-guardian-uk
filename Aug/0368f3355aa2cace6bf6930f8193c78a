Coco Gauff will get a chance for an encore after her magical run to the fourth round at this year’s Wimbledon. The 15-year-old from Florida has received a wildcard entry for the US Open’s main draw. It will be Gauff’s second grand slam tournament after she burst on to the scene in London. Ranked just 313th at the time, Gauff became the youngest player to come through the qualifying rounds at Wimbledon. She then upset five-time champion Venus Williams in the first round and wound up losing to the eventual champion, Simona Halep. Gauff is currently No140 in the WTA rankings. Age restrictions set up by the women’s tour limit the number of tournaments someone who is 15 can enter and the number of wildcard invitations she can be offered. Gauff has already accepted three wildcards elsewhere. But according to the WTA, the US Open which, as a grand slam tournament, is not overseen by the WTA or ATP tours can choose to ignore the eligibility rule and offer Gauff a wildcard. Among the other players receiving wildcards from the US Tennis Association on Tuesday for the women’s field were 2011 US Open champion Sam Stosur and 17-year-old Caty McNally, an American who won the doubles title with Gauff at the Citi Open in Washington this month. The draw for the US Open takes place on 22 August, and play in the year’s last major begins four days later.
