We make our own bespoke cocktails at Aizle, but sometimes simplicity is best, and there are few things more classic than a perfect sazerac. Serves 128ml (ie, one measure) bourbon – we use Wild Turkey 28ml VSOP cognac2 dashes Peychaud’s bitters1 dash angostura bitters5ml basic sugar syrup1 splash absinthe1 strip lemon zest, to garnish Fill a mixing glass with ice, pour over the bourbon, cognac, both bitters and the sugar syrup, and stir to chill. Rinse a chilled cocktail glass with the absinthe, swirling it all around the inside of the glass, then discard. Strain in the contents of the mixing glass, garnish with lemon zest and serve. • Jade Johnston, sommelier, Aizle, Edinburgh
