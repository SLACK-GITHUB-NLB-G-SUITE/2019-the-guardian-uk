Watching Playmobil: The Movie, I was reminded of a scene in Lukas Moodysson’s hippy commune comedy Together. A crestfallen kid explains that he doesn’t get to play with real Lego, but that his dad had attempted to whittle some out of wood. Audiences for Playmobil will relate – they get something with a passing resemblance to The Lego Movie, but one that doesn’t fit together and isn’t any fun. While The Lego Movie is all about creativity and invention, Playmobil shamelessly steals ideas. This eyesore of a cash-in lifts plot elements from Thor and Jumanji, then thinly threads them together with a few songs and shrill mantra about the need for adventure. Never has a final scene sequel setup seemed more optimistic.
