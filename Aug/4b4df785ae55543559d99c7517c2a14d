A pilot fell ill at the controls of an aeroplane flying from Manchester to the Atlantic island of Madeira, forcing the flight to be diverted to northern Portugal. The airline, Jet2, confirmed that the aircraft had to land in Porto on Monday, adding that a replacement aircraft and crew had been dispatched to get passengers to their proper destination. According to one report, which Jet2 did not confirm, the other pilot was joined in the cabin by a passenger, who helped land the plane. “They made the announcement that there had been an incident on the flight deck and another Jet2 pilot who happened to be on holiday came forward from the back of the plane,” MailOnline quoted one of the passengers as saying. Nicholas Banks added: “He offered up his services to the crew and went into the cabin. He didn’t come out until he helped the pilot off the plane when we landed. “The original pilot was wheeled off in a wheelchair with an oxygen mask but we couldn’t really see. The crew did a great job. I was quite relaxed because of the spare pilot and that there was a co-pilot.” A Jet2 spokeswoman said: “Flight LS765 from Manchester to Funchal diverted to Porto as a precautionary measure this morning, due to one of the pilots feeling unwell. A standby aircraft and replacement crew have been flown to Porto so that we can get customers on their way to Funchal as soon as possible.” In a tweet posted shortly after the incident, the firm apologised to passengers. We would like to apologise to customers travelling on #LS765 from #Manchester to Funchal, #Madeira which has diverted into Porto, #Portugal due to an onboard medical situation. We are working to get you on your way ASAP. Please see our agents ‘Portway’ at Gate 2 for more info. Tx It was unable to offer any updates on the pilot’s condition.
