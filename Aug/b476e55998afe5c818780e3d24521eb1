England’s push for victory in the first Ashes Test was hit by confirmation that Jimmy Anderson will not be available to bowl for the remainder of the match. Anderson suffered an injury to his right calf on the first morning, restricting him to four overs, and other than a cameo appearance with the bat he has played no further part. A statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board read: “Jimmy Anderson is still suffering tightness to his right calf. He will not take the field in Australia’s second innings.” Once again Anderson will take his place at No 11 should he be required. Anderson’s absence left England a bowler down as they attempt to pick up wickets at Edgbaston. Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes led the seam attack, backed up by the all-rounder Ben Stokes, but there will be a major emphasis on the spinner Moeen Ali. He picked up the wicket of Cameron Bancroft on the third evening but his nine overs came at a cost of 47 runs and he will need to be tighter if he is to lock down an end. Steve Smith made a brilliant 144 in Australia’s first innings and has continued to confound England’s attack.
