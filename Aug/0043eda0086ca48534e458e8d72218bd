Manchester City are set to sign the full-back João Cancelo from Juventus for a fee of €30m (£27.5m) with Danilo going in the opposite direction. Pep Guardiola is a big admirer of the 25-year-old Portugal international and City have been working on a deal for several weeks now with the two clubs finally reaching an agreement over the weekend. The deal is set to be announced in the next 48 hours. João Cancelo joined Juventus from Valencia last summer and played 25 Serie A games as the club won the Scudetto in 2018-19. He will sign a five-year deal at City. The full-back will be City’s second major summer signing after the arrival of Rodri from Atlético Madrid for £62.6m. They have also recruited Angeliño from PSV Eindhoven for £5.3m. City beat Liverpool on penalties on Sunday to win the Community Shield and afterwards Guardiola spoke of another defender, Harry Maguire, who is set to join Manchester United this week. “Maguire is an excellent, top-class player,” he said. “We were interested but we could not afford him. United could afford him. He’s strong in the air, good with the ball, he can drive with the ball and he’s so fast. He has a lot of qualities, so congratulations to United.”
