The 2004 winner of the Perrier award (as it was known then) pops up every few years with a show that bears no resemblance to the last. Without exception, they are an utter delight. FaceTime – perhaps his most straightforward standup show to date – is no exception. He tells us about life as a husband and parent, how he’s unsociable, bad at DIY, and lacks focus and drive since his 2004 breakthrough. So far, so normal. But Adamsdale will never do a normal show, and FaceTime demonstrates what a skilled operator he is. Frame by frame, the show homes in on his relationship with his three-year-old son, Stan. What begins as a little self-deprecation curdles into something darker and more surreal. The boy’s mild ill-discipline becomes disrespect then outright psychological torture. Adamsdale, one of the gentlest souls in comedy, describes how Stan “kettles” him into the hallway at home. Every time Stan sees him he says: “Not you.” From the bits of dialogue to a dismissive flick of his son’s leg, the subtlety is sublime. It’s not just Stan who’s at it, either. Adamsdale’s wife is betraying him for a Netflix series and his agent’s assistant sticks the boot in beautifully every time he pops into the office. The picture he builds up is of an utterly humiliated man – and his reaction is understated, as if he only just about minds. A supposed curse that he puts on the Netflix series tugs at another loose end, and suddenly the show becomes more like a paranoid fantasy in which he’s been blessed with superpowers to turn all this around. So what starts as domestic standup ends up being more like a Roald Dahl short story. FaceTime gets under your skin, always tempered by Adamsdale’s baffled, vulnerable demeanour. There really is no other comic like him out there, and he’s pulled out yet another peculiar gem. • At Underbelly Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 25 August. • Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.
