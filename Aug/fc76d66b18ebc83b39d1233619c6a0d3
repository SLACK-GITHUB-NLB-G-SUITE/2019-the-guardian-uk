You don’t need cow’s milk to make a great ice-cream, but I did go through a few failed experiments to find an alternative – forays with oat, almond and soy, of which the less is said, the better. I finally settled on coconut milk, which has enough fat to give that creaminess and has a mild enough flavour to pair well with whatever else you choose to throw into the mix. An ice-cream maker is ideal, but if you don’t have one, put a large plastic tub in the freezer before you start. Prep 20 minCook 15 minServes 6 For the ice-cream400g coconut milk100g malt syrup60g light brown sugar For the honeycombOil, to grease150g caster sugar50g water1 tsp bicarbonate of soda For the chocolate sauce100g coconut milk100g vegan dark chocolate, broken into pieces To make the ice-cream, warm half the coconut milk with the malt syrup and sugar for one to two minutes, until the sugar has dissolved. Pour in the remaining coconut milk, mix, then set aside to cool. Once cool, pour into an ice-cream maker and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. If you don’t have an ice-cream maker, pour the cooled mixture into your chilled tub and put in the freezer. Remove and give it a good stir every 20-30 minutes for the next couple of hours, then leave it to chill in the freezer. For the honeycomb, line a small, metal roasting tin with foil, and lightly grease with a little oil. Tip the sugar and water into a large saucepan and put on a medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil the syrup until it reaches a honey-brown colour, then turn off the heat and stir in the bicarb. Quickly pour out the bubbling, molten caramel into your prepared tin and leave it to cool. To make the chocolate sauce, warm the coconut milk in a small pan, then stir in the chocolate until melted. To serve, put a couple of generous scoops of ice-cream in a bowl, crumble over some honeycomb and finish with a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
