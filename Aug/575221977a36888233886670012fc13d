Manchester United are growing frustrated with their pursuit of Paulo Dybala, having failed to agree a deal with the Juventus forward regarding his salary, his image rights and any commission to his agent, Jorge Antun. With only four days to go before the Premier League transfer window closes, United feel they have made a very competitive offer but now expect to miss out on signing the 25-year-old Argentinian. United were hoping that they could sign Dybala as part of a swap deal in which Romelu Lukaku would join Juventus but the expected collapse of that proposal will lead to Inter renewing their interest in the Belgium forward. The Inter manager, Antonio Conte, remains confident the club will be able to sign Lukaku. Meanwhile, the failure of United and Dybala to agree a deal also means that the Premier League club will struggle to sign another of Juventus’s forwards, Mario Mandzukic. Juve saw a potential Dybala-Lukaku swap as an opening for the Croat to leave but if Lukaku does not join the club then they are unlikely to let Mandzukic depart. United will sign Harry Maguire once the defender passes a medical after agreeing an £80m fee with Leicester, to add to the £45m acquisition of Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace, but time is running out for reinforcements up front.
