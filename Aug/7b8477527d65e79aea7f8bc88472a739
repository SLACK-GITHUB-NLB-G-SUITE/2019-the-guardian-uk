Stormzy has announced he will cover the costs of two more black undergraduate students at Cambridge University in the next academic year until the completion of their degree course. The grime artist will pay the tuition fees and maintenance grants of the students from September as part of the Stormzy Scholarship, which funded the studies of two black Cambridge students for the first time last year. The scheme is aimed at supporting people from minority backgrounds who have earned a place at the University of Cambridge. It is hoped the scheme will help address the relatively low number of minority ethnic students who attend Oxbridge institutions. So far Stormzy, who recently headlined Glastonbury, has been funding the cost of the scholarships himself. It is hoped that other funding methods can be found in future to continue the programme with the help of outside investors. The identities of the students supported by the scheme have been kept secret to ensure they have a normal life during their studies, although Stormzy keeps track of their academic progress. On Thursday Stormzy singled out an east London school for praise after 100 pupils there achieved straight As in their A-levels. After the school tweeted of an “absolutely electric” atmosphere after the record results, Stormzy tweeted: “I don’t even know where Brampton Manor is but my kids will be going there.” Almost all the 41 students from the school who gained places at Oxford and Cambridge are from minority ethnic backgrounds and half were on free school meals. “We are really, really proud of our students. They have worked so hard, they’re very talented and we’re delighted for them,” said the school’s head of sixth form, Sam Dobin. “This means a lot to them and it doesn’t come through chance, it comes through hour after hour of really hard work and determination.”
