While I unreservedly endorse the cogent case for freedom of speech regarding the hardships the Palestinian people, including many children, have to endure (Letters, 14 August) as a result of the Israeli government’s actions, it should also be remembered why the IHRA definition of antisemitism is invoked. It is there to prevent ongoing outbreaks of hate speech. Groups of course have a right to openly support the Palestinian cause, but not, as has recently happened, if they veer into accusing Israel of being an apartheid state practising ethnic cleansing. This is inaccurate and crosses the line between free speech and incitement to hatred. We must be mindful of where this may lead in promoting antisemitism further in this still relatively democratic country.Ya’ir KleinLondon
