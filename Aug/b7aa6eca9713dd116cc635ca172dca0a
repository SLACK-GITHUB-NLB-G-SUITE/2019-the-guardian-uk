Argentina’s women’s basketball team had to forfeit their match against Colombia at the Pan American Games on Wednesday after they wore the wrong colour uniforms. The penalty means they can no longer advance to the medal rounds. The Argentinians were supposed to wear white jerseys as the nominal away team but came on to the court in Lima in blue, the same color as Colombia. They had 15 minutes to correct the mistake but could not find the right shirts in time, and Colombia were awarded a walkover 20-0 victory. Argentina had lost their opening match of the tournament against the United States. The embarrassing blunder prompted the resignation of the country’s women’s basketball development director Karina Rodriguez and Argentina’s team leader, Hernan Amaya. “It’s one of the saddest moments of my career,” Araya said. “I take full responsibility for what happened.” Argentina will remain in the competition’s group stage and faces the Virgin Islands on Thursday.
