The summer’s hottest transfer saga shows no sign of fizzling out. No, not Neymar to Barcelona. Or Christian Eriksen to Real Madrid. Or Alexis Sánchez to Inter. Come on: it’s Dejan Lovren to Roma, who remain dead set on signing the Liverpool defender, even though he’s Dejan Lovren. That’s probably the biggest rumour of the day, though the Mill is intrigued to learn that Paul Pogba’s brother, Mathias, reckons the Manchester United midfielder would do well at Real Madrid. Not that he’s biased or anything. Meanwhile Barcelona continue to pursue a deal for Neymar and are offering £150m for the Paris Saint-Germain forward. The La Liga champions are also willing to have someone drive Ousmane Dembélé to Paris as part of the deal. It will give Ivan Rakitic something to do. Having lost Luka Jovic and Sebastien Haller this summer, Eintracht Frankfurt have decided it would be less hassle to have a striker who never scores. As such they’re in for Everton’s goalshy forward Cenk Tosun. However Tosun saw Theo Walcott’s horror miss against Aston Villa at the weekend and reckons he could yet have a chance of establishing himself at Everton. Nacho Monreal, described by some Arsenal fans as the best left-back in England, is so good that he’s off to Real Sociedad. Meanwhile Manchester City are planning a £1.5m swoop for Hearts whizzkid Aaron Hickey, a 17-year-old defender. Apparently Rachid Ghezzal still plays for Leicester. Not for much longer, though – Olympiakos are closing in on a deal for the winger. Elsewhere Brighton disappointment Jürgen Locadia could join Hoffenheim on loan.
