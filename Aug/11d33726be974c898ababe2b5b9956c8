Bury FC, one of the country’s oldest clubs, has been kicked out of the Football League after 125 years of membership. The club’s expulsion exposes the failure of owner Steve Dale, the weaknesses in football’s governance and vulnerability of small town clubs. We want to hear from Bury fans about how they feel about the expulsion. Share your memories of the club, and what this means for its future. What do you do without football on a Saturday?
