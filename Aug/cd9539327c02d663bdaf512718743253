Ole Gunnar Solskjær believes Paul Pogba’s “strong character” will not be affected despite the racist abuse he suffered after missing a penalty at Wolves on Monday. The Frenchman was targeted on Twitter after the 1-1 draw at Molineux and officials from United will meet with the social media site to discuss how to address an issue that is ongoing. Solskjær said Pogba has dealt with the abuse admirably. “Paul’s fine – Paul’s a strong character and it makes him stronger. When you speak to him he’s fine,” Solskjaer said. “I just cannot believe we’re still here in 2019 talking about these instances. Social media is a place where people can hide behind fake Ids. “It’s not down to me to change it but there are so many Ole Gunnar Solskjærs on Twitter [who] I know are not me and we’ve got to do something about it – the authorities have got to do something about it, you feel sorry for them [the abusers], they must have problems themselves.” Asked what he hopes might be achieved at the meeting with Twitter he said: “We need to protect individuals and protect people. When there are death threats and racism, it’s serious allegations, serious incidents.” The club will not ask their players to stop being active online. “What can we do about it as Manchester United? We’re not going to ban our players [from] social media. We have to spread the good word, we can use it to spread good and have to stop those incidents.” The penalty miss was Pogba’s fourth for United. Yet Solskjær said: “I’m sure you’re going to see Paul Pogba score a pen for United again, we’re practising pens still and Marcus [Rashford] and Paul are still on them.”
