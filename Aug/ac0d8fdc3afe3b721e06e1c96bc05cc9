The Solario Stakes has proved itself to be one of the most significant Group Two events for juveniles in the calendar in recent seasons, with Too Darn Hot and the 2018 Derby winner, Masar, successful in the last two renewals and the outstanding Kingman and Raven’s Pass, the only British-trained winner of the Breeders’ Cup Classic, also on the roll of honour since 2007. Positive, from Clive Cox’s stable, is the form horse on his second behind Pinatubo, the favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, at Goodwood last time. Any of his six rivals could find enough improvement to trouble him, however, and Al Suhail – like Masar, having his third run for Charlie Appleby here – was a very easy winner at Yarmouth last time. He has been backed from 5-1 in recent days and could still offer some value at around 9-4. Sandown Park 1.50 Four runs in a fortnight seemed to take the edge off Daschas last time but he has had a month to recover and has a big chance on his earlier form for today’s jockey, Marco Ghiani, including a useful win at Windsor off a 2lb lower mark. Beverley 2.05 The step up to 10 furlongs at Newmarket’s July meeting brought a seasonal best from Dark Vision. Not much has gone right for him in two starts over a mile since then but he has also dropped a 1lb in the weights before today’s step back up in trip. Sandown Park 2.25 Country was a ready winner off an opening mark of 88 at Redcar earlier this month and is the least exposed runner in the field. A 5lb rise in the weights is unlikely to stop him as he looks to complete a four-timer. Chester 2.45 Stivers, a runner-up at Group One level in Argentina last year, is an intriguing contender as he starts out with Dermot Weld. His latest trainer has a solid 15% strike-rate with his runners in Britain but Stivers has not raced since January and Simon Crisford’s Outbox may be the safer bet today. Sandown Park 3.00 Jubiloso was a hot favourite for the Oak Tree Stakes at Goodwood last time having previously finished third in the Group One Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She had no luck in running when only third behind Billesdon Brook in a 17-runner field but a smaller field and more conventional track should see a return to winning form today. Beverley 3.15 Tis Marvellous was only fourth on his first try at Listed level at Doncaster in March, but that was his also his first start since September and he has since shown abrupt improvement to finish second in the Wokingham and then first in a strong handicap back over five furlongs. His best form has come at Ascot so far but anything close to it should be enough here.
