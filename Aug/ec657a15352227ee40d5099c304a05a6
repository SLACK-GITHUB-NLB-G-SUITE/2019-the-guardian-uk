Every year the National Eisteddfod of Wales is held in the first week of August. Every year the “national” newspapers are oblivious to its existence. This is the largest and oldest cultural festival in Europe, with very high standards in choral, instrumental and singing performances. The literary competitions in poetry and drama, and the visual arts and science exhibitions, are among the best in the “United” Kingdom, yet there is never any mention of any of this. Highly talented young people take part in the Eisteddfod, but their abilities are ignored – and all because it is in Welsh and in Wales. There is no comparison between these high standards and the standards at Glastonbury, for example, and yet it is the latter that is given all of the publicity.James GriffithsBangor, Gwynedd • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
