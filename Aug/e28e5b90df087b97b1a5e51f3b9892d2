Robert F Kennedy’s granddaughter, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, has died aged 22. The Kennedy family released a statement on Thursday night, following reports of a death at the family’s compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The statement was issued by Brian Wright O’Connor, a spokesman for the former congressman Joseph P Kennedy II. Hill was the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy’s fifth child, Courtney, and Paul Michael Hill, who was one of four falsely convicted in the 1974 Irish Republican Army bombings of two pubs. The statement says Saoirse Hill was passionate about human rights and women’s empowerment and that she worked with indigenous communities to build schools in Mexico. The statement quoted her 91-year-old grandmother, Ethel Kennedy, as saying: “The world is a little less beautiful today.” Further details weren’t released.
