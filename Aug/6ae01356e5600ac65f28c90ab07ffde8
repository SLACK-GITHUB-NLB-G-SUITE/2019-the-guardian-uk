This September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops. Second Hand September aims to reduce the environmental impact of fast fashion, given that the textile industry is responsible for creating more CO2 emissions than aviation and shipping combined. To mark the initiative, we’d like to share stories from readers about their beloved charity shop clothes. So pick an item from your wardrobe that you think is smashing, share a photo of yourself wearing it and we might feature your story in our coverage. Where did you buy it and how long have you owned it? What kind of occasions do you wear it for? You can share your stories and pictures in the form below. We will feature some of your contributions as part of our coverage. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
