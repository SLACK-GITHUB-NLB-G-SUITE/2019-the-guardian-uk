Frenchman Nicolas Edet became the new overall leader in the Vuelta a España on Saturday as German rider Nikias Arndt sprinted to victory on stage eight in the province of Barcelona. Team Sunweb’s Arndt finished out front among the 20 breakaway riders in the hilly ride through Catalonia from Valls to Igualada, holding his nerve in the slippery conditions to claim his second Grand Tour stage win, his first since the 2016 Giro d’Italia. Stage eight (Valls - Igualada, 166.9km): 1 N Arndt (Ger) Sunweb 3hr 50min 48sec; 2 A Aranburu (Sp) Caja Rural; 3 T van der Sande (Bel) Lotto Soudal; 4 R Guerreiro (Por) Katusha-Alpecin; 5 Jonas Koch (Ger) CCC; 6 D Teuns (Bel) Bahrain-Merida; 7 J Lastra (Sp) Caja Rural; 8 T Ludvigsson (Swe) Groupama-FDJ; 9 F Barcelo (Sp) Euskadi-Murias; 10 S Henao (Col) UAE-Emirates all same time. General classification: 1 N Edet (Fr) Cofidis at 32hr 16min 24sec; 2 D Teuns (Bel) Bahrain-Merida at 2min 21sec; 3 MÁ López (Col) Astana at 3min 1sec; 4 P Roglic (Slo) Jumbo-Visma at 3min 7sec; 5 A Valverde (Sp) Movistar at 3min 17sec; 6 N Quintana (Col) Movistar at 3min 28sec; 7 CF Hagen (Nor) Lotto Soudal at 3min 45sec; 8 R Majka (Pol) Bora-Hansgrohe at 4min 59sec; 9 T Pogacar (Slo) UAE-Emirates at 4min 59sec; 10 E Chaves (Col) Mitchelton-Scott at 5min 53sec. Edet came 11th in the stage to snatch the red jersey from Miguel Ángel López and take an overall lead of two minutes 21 seconds over Belgian Dylan Teuns of Bahrain-Merida, while Astana’s GC hope López is three minutes one second down in third. With a gruelling mountain stage coming on Sunday in Andorra, the previous day’s general classification leaders’ group containing López and Primoz Roglic (Jumbo-Visma) opted to save their energy and came in nine minutes 24 seconds behind Arndt. “I think we played it very smart, with Martijn Tusveld in the break, who could attack while I sat back and waited for the sprint,” said Arndt. “It’s one of the best days in my career so far.” The new red jersey Edet, meanwhile, added: “It’s huge – there are no other words. It’s a crazy thing. I’m going to defend it this jersey, I’m going to give it my all.”
