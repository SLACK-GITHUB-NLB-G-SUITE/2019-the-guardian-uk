Andy Lonergan is being considered as a short-term solution to Liverpool’s goalkeeping crisis with Alisson expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks with a calf injury. The 35-year-old is a free agent having been released by Middlesbrough at the end of last season and provided cover for Simon Mignolet during Liverpool’s summer tour of the US, which Alisson missed as he recovered from Brazil’s Copa América triumph. The manager, Jürgen Klopp, may again turn to the former Preston, Leeds and Bolton keeper with the offer of a short-term contract once the extent of Alisson’s injury has been confirmed. Liverpool’s medical staff are continuing to assess the calf injury the Brazil international sustained in the first half of the Premier League win against Norwich on Friday. There are concerns the influential No 1 may be absent until late September or early October, a period that would force him out of the first Champions League group game. Klopp confirmed immediately after the 4-1 win on Friday that his £65m goalkeeper would miss the Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea in Istanbul on Wednesday. The former West Ham goalkeeper Adrián will continue to deputise for Alisson having made his Liverpool debut only four days after signing on a free transfer. With Mignolet sold to Club Brugge, however, and the third choice Caoimhin Kelleher recovering from a broken wrist, the 32-year-old Spaniard is Liverpool’s only available option for the Super Cup. The academy goalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros also sustained an elbow injury during pre-season. Kelleher returned to training last week and could be involved in Istanbul although Klopp is wary of rushing the Republic of Ireland under-21 international back into competitive action following his wrist problem. Lonergan would provide more experienced cover for Adrián over the short-term should Liverpool’s fears be realised over Alisson’s injury.
