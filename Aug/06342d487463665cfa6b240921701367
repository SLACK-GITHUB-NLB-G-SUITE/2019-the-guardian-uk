Hattie Cansino, 30Madeleine’s been my best friend for years. I came to stay with her and her daughter Tabby for six weeks in July last year before going to Brazil to study. The three of us had such a nice time that they invited me back after my year away. When I returned, they’d redecorated the spare room especially. When Tabby was born, I was young and a baby seemed so adult and alien. I have a lot of guilt for not being around as much as I should have then; I hope I’m making up for it now. I walk Tabby to school three times a week and help with homework. Looking after her isn’t babysitting at all, she’s an absolutely lovely kid. I wouldn’t be able to live with all of my friends, but this works well because we are way beyond the point of needing to fill silences. I have a fiance in Brazil and my PhD finishes soon, but I’ll stay as long as I can. Madeleine Bloomfield, 30Those six weeks when Hattie came to stay were like a long sleepover. Tabby and I enjoyed her company so much, we cried when she left. We’d speak to her most days via FaceTime or text, and Tabby even started to learn Portuguese. Having her living with us is wonderful. Tabby will come in and say, straight away, “Where’s Hattie?” Tabby’s now nine years old, and is very straightforward about our living situation – she tells people Hattie is my best friend. It does take a while for people to realise she’s my gal pal, though, not my girlfriend. I’ve been single for three years and I’m very much a lazy dater. Hattie has to push me out of the house. But being at home with Hattie and Tabby is where I really want to be. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, email family@theguardian.com with Under one roof in the subject line
