Manchester United are waiting on the results of scans on Anthony Martial amid concern the forward sustained a thigh problem in the defeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday. United also expect to discover on Tuesday the results of a scan on Luke Shaw, with fears growing the left-back could be out for at least a month with a hamstring problem suffered against Palace. Martial was seen limping when departing Old Trafford after the game and should the Frenchman have sustained a serious injury it may affect Alexis Sánchez’s proposed loan move to Internazionale, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær needing him for his forward line. The manager played down concern over Martial and Shaw. “We’ll have to wait and see,” he said after the match. “Hopefully they won’t be too bad and maybe we can have them training during the week.” If Shaw is ruled out Solskjær’s options include Ashley Young, the club captain, or, possibly, Marcos Rojo. The latter is primarily a centre-back, though he was voted into the 2014 World Cup Fifa team of the tournament at left-back. Diogo Dalot, who operates in the position, is injured, and the 18-year-old Angel Gomes is a further alternative. Rojo could leave before the continental window closes on 2 September, with Marseille, Milan and Monaco thought to be interested. United were expected to resume discussions with Internazionale regarding Sánchez’s loan on Monday, with the last major stumbling block the proportion of his £20m-a-year salary the Italian club are to source. United want the latter to pay around €6m (£5.5m); Internazionale want a sum closer to €3m.
