This movie returns us to the strangely unrewarding story of the “JT LeRoy” literary hoax, recently discussed in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 2016 documentary Author: The JT LeRoy Story. “JT LeRoy” was the pen name, or avatar, or bogus persona created by American author Laura Albert who wrote avowedly autobiographical fiction about a young boy’s experiences of homelessness and sexual abuse – but Albert compulsively posed as the supposedly reclusive and charismatic author on the phone to a growing number of journalists and celebrity fans. Aware that “JT” would have to be produced in person at some stage, she persuaded her sister-in-law Savannah Knoop to pose in a wig and dark glasses for photo ops. This bizarre fake was eventually exposed in 2005 to the embarrassment and rage of many who had been duped, chiefly the actor Asia Argento who had solemnly bought into the phenomenon and directed a dismally bad movie based on one of the JT LeRoy books. Now Knoop has co-written and co-produced a movie inspired by her own bizarre experience (and based on her own book), with Kristen Stewart playing Knoop and Laura Dern as the exuberant, manic, manipulative Albert. Jim Sturgess plays Albert’s husband and Diane Kruger plays a credulous movie-star superfan inspired by Argento. It’s a very forthright performance from Dern, but Stewart is simply too opaque and subdued in the role of Knoop. The film itself pulls its punches, unwilling to satirise either her or the egregious Albert too fiercely; it is inhibited about really attacking the vanity of the situation. And, as with the Feuerzeig documentary, I wanted to hear much more of the truth about Albert’s own background. Were these books really based on some emotional reality or not? • JT LeRoy is released in the UK on 16 August.
