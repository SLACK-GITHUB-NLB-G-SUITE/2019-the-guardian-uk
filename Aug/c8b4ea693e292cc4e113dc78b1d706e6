Your Test match report (23 August) quotes part of a conversation overheard between Leeds “locals” at Burley Park: “It’s looking a bit black over Bill’s mother’s.” “A little local knowledge goes a long way here in Leeds,” the reporter observes. Seems to me the weather reference alludes to a collection of short stories published earlier this year: It’s Gone Dark Over Bill’s Mother’s, by Lisa Blower. She was writing about Stoke. Damn sophisticated, these northerners.Ray RumsbyLittle Melton, Norfolk • “Johnson heads to Europe,” said your headline (21 August).

Premature descriptions?Jane MaguireAldborough, Norfolk • In Northern Ireland (which gets the best GCSE and A-level results) there are shorter breaks during the school year, but pupils have the whole of July and August off – a proper summer (Letters, 23 August).Maggie JohnstonSt Albans, Hertfordshire • The great PD James sussed out the absurdity of the 10,000-hour theory (Letters, 23 August) over 25 years ago.
