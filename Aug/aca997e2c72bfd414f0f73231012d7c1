The Football Association is launching a streaming platform dedicated to women’s football from the start of the 2019-20 season. The FA Player will provide live access to more than 150 domestic games throughout the campaign, including all Women’s Super League (WSL) matches and a fixture from each round of the Championship. The platform, which will be free to use and available online and via an app, will also have selected England, FA Cup and Continental League Cup highlights, plus archive footage and features. The FA also said in its announcement on Tuesday that BT Sport and the BBC will continue their regular coverage, with over 30 live games televised across the new season. The FA’s director of the women’s professional game, Kelly Simmons, said: “This announcement is a pivotal and significant step in the FA’s journey to grow the women’s game and attract new audiences. “We know people want to watch football in different ways, with content that’s quickly and easily accessible. “This new live streaming service will give them unique access to over 150 live fixtures in all competitions, all available at the click of a button. “This will help build on the fantastic coverage BBC and BT Sport give the women’s game on their channels so that fans can enjoy the best of women’s football when and how they wish.” The platform will launch ahead of the WSL season, which starts on 7 September when Manchester City face Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium. England’s 2-1 semi-final defeat against the United States at this summer’s Women’s World Cup in France was, according to the BBC, watched by a peak TV audience of 11.7 million – a UK record figure for women’s football.
