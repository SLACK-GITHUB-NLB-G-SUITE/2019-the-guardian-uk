Mesut Özil and Sead Kolasinac will not play for Arsenal at Newcastle on Sunday after concerns about their security caused the club to withdraw them from contention. Arsenal said police were investigating “further security incidents” that come just over a fortnight after the players were targeted by carjackers in north London. On that occasion security camera footage showed Kolasinac confronting the offenders, who were brandishing knives, after they approached Özil’s car in Golders Green. The two players and a female passenger emerged unhurt from the incident. Özil tweeted a photograph of the pair a day later with the caption “Think we’re fine” but neither featured in the Emirates Cup defeat by Lyon the following weekend after talks with Unai Emery. They had been expected to play in the Premier League season opener, though, and the manager gave no indication of any problems during his pre-match press conference. However, Arsenal later released a statement announcing the players would be unavailable for selection at St James’ Park. “Mesut Özil and Sead Kolasinac will not be part of the squad for our opening match against Newcastle following further security incidents which are being investigated by the police,” it read. “The welfare of our players and their families is always a top priority and we have taken this decision following discussion with the players and their representatives. We are liaising with the police and are providing the players and their families with ongoing support. We look forward to welcoming the players back to the squad as soon as possible. We will not be making any further comment on the matter.” The Guardian understands both players are safe and unharmed, and that their homes are being guarded by security personnel. The Metropolitan police were unable to provide further information, saying that they are in contact with the club and will investigate any offences reported appropriately.
