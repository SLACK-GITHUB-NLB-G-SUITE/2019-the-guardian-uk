In 1978 Markéta Luskačová, who had not long arrived in Britain from Prague, was invited to photograph the people of the north-east of England, as part of a project that also involved Henri Cartier-Bresson. Luskačová, who had been engaged in taking pictures of the street markets in London’s East End, where she now lived, knew exactly where she wanted to go – to the beach at Whitley Bay. There were a couple of reasons for this. She had visited the area once before, and been drawn both by the greyness of the light and the warmth of the people she had encountered. This latter fact was important as she knew she would have to travel with her one-year-old son, Matthew, to take her photographs, and she had a sense that families on the beach, making the best of it in all weathers, might be happy to look after him while she went about her work with her camera. Her hopes were well founded. In a moving, evocative book of those pictures published next month (with an accompanying exhibition in Bristol) Luskačová notes how her pram wheels got stuck in the sand every morning, but the nearest family was always more than happy to mind her son as she looked for subjects. There is a profoundly human quality to what she saw – old men and women in their Sunday hats and coats; dogs and children excited by the freedom; fastidious windbreaks and serious beach cricket and reviving pots of tea – which is common to the grain of all Luskačová’s work. In this picture, sky and sea and sand bleed into that otherworldly middle distance, from which ponies and children and cyclists emerge. Like Luskačová’s photograph, the couple in the foreground seem both rooted in their moment and slightly out of time. • By the Sea: Photographs from the North East, 1976–1980 by Markéta Luskačová is out next month (RRB Photobooks, £45). An exhibition of the photographs is on at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, until 5 October
