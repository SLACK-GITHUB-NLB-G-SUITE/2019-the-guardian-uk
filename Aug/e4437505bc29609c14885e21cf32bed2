Enable is the undoubted star of the afternoon at York on Thursday, as she makes her final start on a British track and attempts to extend her winning streak to 12 races. From a betting point of view, however, the preceding Clipper Logistics Handicap over a mile is the race that all the punters will hope to solve. Firmament (3.00) could prove to be the answer at a track where he never seems to run a bad race. ]The form of the Golden Mile at Goodwood earlier this month runs through today’s 20-strong field like a watermark, with half a dozen of the runners lining up again here. Seniority looked unlucky when fourth there and could well reverse the form with runner-up Vale Of Kent, but both could struggle to cope with Firmament if he is anywhere close to his best. He put up one of the strongest performances of his career to win over seven furlongs on the Knavesmire in mid-June, and performed with credit behind Raising Sand at Ascot last time. Back on a track where his form figures read 123321, mostly in big-field handicaps like today’s race, David O’Meara’s seven-year-old is a very generous price at around 10-1. York 1.55 John Quinn’s Liberty Beach has already proved herself to be one of the fastest juvenile fillies in Britain and while the step up to six furlongs is an unknown, her excellent trainer is confident that it will be within reach. She will take plenty of stopping if so. Even the Princess Margaret Stakes winner, Under The Stars, has something to find with the favourite on at least two of her runs to date. There is no reason to think that Liberty Beach has stopped improving yet. Quinn has pencilled in a trip to the Breeders’ Cup at the end of the season and today’s race should be another step along the path to California.York 2.25 A maximum field for one of the most valuable juvenile races of the season, but as ever, a wide range of abilities on show as it is restricted to graduates of last year’s Premier Yearling Sale at Goffs. Show Me Show Me, who took the Brocklesby on the opening day of the season at Doncaster, has proved more durable than most winners of that race but may have started to plateau. Rayong, who was sent to contest a Group Two at Deauville last time by Karl Burke, is a big contender at around 8-1 on his form when third at Sandown in July.

A small field could make for a tactical race but John Gosden’s mare had the speed to win the Eclipse at Sandown in July and Frankie Dettori is most unlikely to be caught out by any of his rivals’ manoeuvres. Her hard race at Ascot when only a neck in front of Crystal Ocean in the King George may be more of a concern for backers looking to go in head down at around 2-7. Dettori needed only one stroke of the whip to get her home though, and she always looks ready to find more for her jockey.
