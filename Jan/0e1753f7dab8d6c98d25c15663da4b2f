Huddersfield Town have identified Borussia Dortmund’s second team manager, Jan Siewert, as their preferred choice to replace David Wagner. Talks have taken place between the clubs with Dortmund looking for a €300,000 compensation package before releasing the 36-year-old. Siewert has coached the under-23s since July 2017 after succeeding the Norwich-bound Daniel Farke. Huddersfield’s chairman, Dean Hoyle, believes the relatively unknown coach has the potential to replicate the impact Wagner had after making the same move in 2015. Wagner, who led Huddersfield into the Premier League in 2017, also arrived at the club having worked as Dortmund’s under-23 manager. It is understood Huddersfield are not looking for a firefighter despite their ominous position in the table. They are bottom, having won only two matches this season, and welcome the champions Manchester City to the John Smith’s Stadium on Sunday. The club believe the new man should be given time to implement his plans, even if they are faced with relegation to the Championship. Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, confirmed talks had been held but added “nothing is decided yet”. Siewert has managed Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth tier in Germany, and been assistant manager at Bochum, who are in the second tier. He has also worked with the Germany under-17 and under-18 teams. Wagner left Huddersfield this week, with Hoyle saying he needed time away from the “rigours of football management”.
