Virgil van Dijk said he could feel the nervousness of the Anfield crowd during Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Leicester on Wednesday but believes it unnecessary with 14 games of the title race remaining. The restiveness of the home support was noticeable as Liverpool missed an opportunity to go seven points clear of Manchester City in dropping points against a team outside the Premier League top six for the first time this season. Van Dijk insists the atmosphere did not affect him but, with a five-point lead and four months of the campaign to go, said now is not the time for impatience. Asked whether Anfield felt nervous, he said: “It sounded like it.” Did it transmit to him? “Not to me,” he replied. “You get that feeling as well from the crowd and I think it’s not really necessary at the moment. But everyone wants to win so bad and that’s what we want as well. But sometimes you need to be very patient.” Van Dijk denied Liverpool’s desperation for a first league title in 29 years will complicate matters for Jürgen Klopp’s team as the run-in progresses. “I don’t think so. In the end it’s all about showing on the pitch and we’re not going to be affected by that. We want everyone to cheer us on and keep pushing even if we have tough moments, even if we’re 1-0 down or maybe more. We just need everyone to pull in the same direction and keep going, that’s the only way forward.”
