The serial photobomber who stole the show and became a meme after this year’s Golden Globes has made a new splash with a cameo on The Bold and the Beautiful. Canadian model Kelleth Cuthbert became known as Fiji Water Girl after popping up in the background of a series of celebrity portraits taken during the 72nd Golden Globes awards in January. She was at the event as one of a number of promotional staff for the water company, a Globes sponsor, but went viral after Twitter users noticed her face and distinctive blue dress turning up in shot after shot. Rumours about Cuthbert’s link to the long-running CBS soap opera began circulating after she posted a picture of herself with actors from The Bold and the Beautiful on Instagram last week, thanking the production team for having her on set. CBS haven’t confirmed her role as yet, or whether it will be an ongoing one, but the official Instagram account for The Bold and the Beautiful also posted a picture of Cuthbert on set, in the background, wearing a black dress and carrying … a tray of water. Look who was on the #BoldandBeautiful set today! 👀 #ifyouknowyouknow A post shared by  The Bold and The Beautiful (@boldandbeautifulcbs) on Jan 14, 2019 at 2:51pm PST The Bold and the Beautiful appearance comes after stints on the Late Late Show With James Corden and E! News, among others, in the wake of her Golden Globes notoriety. IMDB currently lists her appearance at the Globes as “Fiji Water Girl”. Not everyone found Cuthbert’s knack for getting in the frame endearing: Jamie Lee Curtis said in a tweet that she had deliberately tried to move away from the promotional staff for the Globes sponsors, Fiji and Moet. “I didn’t want to be doing advertising for either. The sponsors of events need to get permission from people before they try to take their picture with them,” Curtis said. While some called the Golden Globes incident an obvious PR stunt, Cuthbert claimed she hadn’t set out to photobomb. “No matter where you move, you’re in somebody’s shot,” she later told the Cut. “I think from so many years of modelling, when I hear a shutter, I just kind of give a face.” The Bold and the Beautiful first aired in 1987 as a companion series to CBS’s other long-running soap, The Young and the Restless, and aired its 8000th episode this January. Cuthbert is expected to appear on the show on 6 February.
