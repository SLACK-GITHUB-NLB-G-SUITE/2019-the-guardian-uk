Did you feel the inevitability? Tom Brady in overtime, needing to put together a drive to win the game and send the New England Patriots to their ninth Super Bowl. And, of course, he delivered, because Brady always delivers. He marched his team down the field with the confidence and presence of the greatest to ever play quarterback. It wasn’t an easy night for Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots. The Kansas City Chiefs pushed them to the brink in a game that took more twists than a dodgy M Night Shyamalan flick: there was a muffed punt controversy; a catch-no catch; an abysmal roughing the passer penalty, when Chris Jones dared to touch Brady’s shoulder pads; a blatant illegal interception leading to a score; and it was all capped with a bone-headed neutral zone infraction to extend the game. Chiefs pass-rusher Dee Ford lined up in the neutral zone as time wound down in the fourth quarter, negating what would have been a game-clinching interception. And then there was Kansas City’s young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, that delightful magician, who went toe-to-toe with Belichick, the greatest defensive mind in league history, and kept producing haymakers. The 23-year-old, in his first full season, unleashed some of those rare, dimension-altering throws that only he appears capable of conjuring: Mahomes drills the sidearm with pressure in his face 💪(via @thecheckdown) pic.twitter.com/uaMVvk4MgS The final two minutes of the fourth quarter were a masterclass in quarterback play from both sides. Brady and Mahomes exchanged clutch drives. First, Brady led one of his classic two-minute drills, putting the Patriots up 31-28 with under a minute to go. Then Mahomes led his team to a field goal with seconds left to force overtime. What was incredible was that neither man showed nerves with the season on the line. And if either Brady or Mahomes did have nerves, they were channeled into making them play even better. The NFL’s overtime rules dictate that if the first team who possesses the ball scores a touchdown, the game is over. When Brady was given the ball after New England won the toss, he obliged. Three third-down conversions thrown to his most reliable lieutenants – Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski – helped seal victory. Brady led the team to the four-yard line before Rex Burkhead plunged into the end zone to set up a date with the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta in two weeks. Already recognized as the greatest player to play the position, Brady is now rubbing it in. His ninth Super Bowl trip is more than the Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers, Broncos, and Packers have had in their entire histories. It is hard to overstate how absurd that is. These are not run-of-the-mill franchises. It’s a who’s who of sporting institutions. They are the founding fathers of the game, and Brady’s history bests them all. New England haven’t been at their clinical best this season. They have struggled on the road and been fortunate to play in a poor division – posting a +100-point differential in the AFC East and +1 out of it. But the team aren’t ready to relinquish the throne just yet. Belichick remains the league’s greatest difference-maker. And even at 41, Brady can muster a heroic drive or three when a season is on the line. “I felt pretty good about our chances,” team captain Matthew Slater said postgame. “Because we have Tom Brady as a teammate.” It wouldn’t be a high-stakes NFL game without an officiating debacle: Another look at that no-flag callpic.twitter.com/PQIMkvrMHX On one play, the officials in the Saints-Rams game missed two egregious penalties: a pass interference call; and a blatant helmet-to-helmet hit. Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman didn’t just arrive a beat early, he obliterated Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis. The right call would have given New Orleans a 98% chance to win, per ESPN Stats & Info. Instead, the Saints were forced to kick a field-goal to tie the game. The Rams marched down the field on the subsequent drive, with kicker Greg Zuerlein hitting a 57-yard game-winning field goal in overtime. “Just getting off the phone with the league office. They blew the call,” Saints coach Sean Payton said after the game. “I don’t know if there was ever a more obvious pass interference call.” The NFL has resisted expanding replay to so-called judgment calls – like pass interference. Technology is improving and we have better looks available, faster than ever before. More calls should be challengeable/reviewable. The Canadian Football League adopted challenges for pass interference back in 2015. The NFL should be a leader on this subject, not a follower. “Listen, it’s tough to get over it,” Payton concluded. “We’ll probably never get over it.” For the first time in the Super Bowl era, both Conference Championship games went to overtime. The Drake curse appears to be alive and well. With the Rams and Patriots triumphing, we will now get our second LA v Boston match-up for a championship in four months, after the Dodgers and Red Sox played for the World Series. “I’m a bad motherfucker” – Tom Brady. What did Tom Brady say? Trust me, it is gold #Patriots pic.twitter.com/zHnh7ZwrUY Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. He knows it. Every player in the league knows it. Give me this Brady at a podium, dripping with arrogance, and unafraid who knows it, rather than the cliché spewing robot we’ve become accustomed too. Tony Romo, CBS Sports. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback may be the biggest winner from Championship Sunday. He owned the AFC title broadcast, cementing himself as the very best analyst in the NFL, and possibly all of sports. The beauty of Romo’s analysis is that it feels like he’s in on the fun with you. He’s not an outsider who spends 60 minutes reminding you of his past glories. He’s here to inform and entertain and watch great football. Romo often knows what’s going to happen based on formations and motions and pre-snap hand gestures, minute details only someone with his experience at quarterback could possibly comprehend. Then he gets as excited as a kid. It’s the perfect combination. • The NFL’s outdated overtime rules cost us an exhilarating end to the Chiefs-Patriots game. Winning a coin toss should not be such a decisive factor in a game of such importance. The argument that a team should just “play defense” is a valid one. Yet as football continues to favor offense, not allowing both sides an opportunity to possess the ball becomes more nonsensical. Instead, the league should adopt college football’s overtime rules. They are fairer and more exciting. • Saints super fan The Whistle Monsta (yes, that’s a real person) dominated the Saints-Rams broadcast. He drew complaints online during Sunday’s game for his piercing whistle, which was picked up throughout by Fox’s in-stadium microphones. Quick note: if you ever find yourself, in any situation, sporting or otherwise, wondering if whistling can improve it, the answer is no. • Is there a greater gap at a position between the best and second best than Aaron Donald at defensive tackle? No other player is even close. • The Cowboys fired offensive coordinator Scott Linehan over the weekend, a week after saying his job was safe. Former Dallas backup quarterback Kellen Moore is in line for the gig after spending the year as the Cowboys’ QB coach. • Bill Belichick will compete in his 11th Super Bowl as a coach in Atlanta against the Rams, nine as a head coach and two as a defensive coordinator. Dare I say: it may be time to consider renaming the Lombardi trophy.
