Katie Boulter, cool in every way but one on a day of killing heat, earned a second-round match in the first slam of the season against one of the most feared young players in tennis, Aryna Sabalenka, when she outlasted another formidable Russian, Ekaterina Makarova, in three sets. It took the 22-year-old Leicester prospect two hours and 24 minutes to win 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10-6), but she got in a muddle at the end when she forgot the new match tie-break was in operation, celebrating three points too early. Sabalenka, the 11th seed, experienced no such drama in dismissing her compatriot, Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-4 in a little over an hour. Her match against Boulter on Wednesday will at least be more comfortable, as the temperature is expected to fall from the opening day 35C. Boulter, who made the main draw on merit and is ranked 97 in the world, blushed when explaining how she began to celebrate after going 7-4 up in the final-set tie-break. “I was in the moment and I kind of forgot that it was first-to-10,” she said. “It’s very tough to turn around, to get back to work and find a way, because you’ve just released and you think you’ve won the match. I thought I did that really well and I am pretty proud of myself for digging deep. “The umpire actually said it at the end of six-all [in the set score]. I didn’t hear it because I was so focussed on myself and in the zone that I didn’t process it. “I had actually seen it a lot, over Twitter and stuff. But it’s so tough to say what’s going to go through your mind at that point, as it’s a new rule. I ended up getting the win. I probably would have been devastated had I not. A couple of people have mentioned in to me [via phone messages] and I can laugh it off now. At least I know the rule, so it definitely won’t happen again.” Wooopsy 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/07nKcgMJKx As high emotions swept over other corners of Melbourne Park, Boulter remained calm. Several times, she was under pressure and hit her way out of trouble with carefree disregard for the consequences, which she later described as, “my way”. She blew four break points in the seventh game of the third set, then had to save two in the next game to stay in the fight, but did not panic, trusting her shot-making to transfer the pressure back across the net. “I’ve focused really hard on just relaxing through the shot and trying to play my way instead of getting caught in someone else’s,” she said. “I think I did that really well. “My expectations were just to enjoy the moment. I put in so much hard work last year to get to this point that I just wanted to have fun out there and compete, and do the best that I could.” As for handling the stamina-draining heat, she said, “I’ve come a long way with that. I actually cramped last year. I just wanted to get through a match. I knew it was at a high-quality level and I was going to have to fight for it. I think I stayed pretty calmly, and my body held up really well.” It is early days in her journey but, having recently been signed by David Beckham’s promotional company, she would seem to be on the sponsors’ radar. If she were to shock Sabalenka, they would be well pleased. Elsewhere, British tears flowed. Poor Harriet Dart, who’d done well to qualify, found Maria Sharapova in unforgiving mood as they shared the honour of opening the tournament on Rod Laver Arena. The Russian, Dart’s childhood hero, showed no mercy in dismissing her with a rare double bagel. Dart, who arrived with a career-high ranking of 131, could not contain her tears when leaving the big stage a little over an hour after walking out to the biggest occasion of her young career. “It was a difficult match,” she said later. “She doesn’t really give you anything. She came out of the box quickly. The whole environment was different for me, coming from the smaller courts, but I carried myself well out there. There are many years in front of me.” A tearful Heather Watson was also devastated after claiming an unwanted piece of history as the first player to leave the tournament, when the 31st seed Petra Martic beat her 6-1, 6-2 on Court14. “I was feeling a bit anxious,” the former British No1 said. “I so wanted to do well. It was very hot out there. I’ve got to change something. I can’t continue like this, that’s for sure.” Also through are second seed and former champion, Angelique Kerber, who lost only four games against Polona Hercog and meets Brazilian qualifier Bernarda Pera in the second round. The German is in the same quarter as the former US Open champion, Sloane Stephens, who plays the unseeded Hungarian Timea Babos after taking just 67 minutes to beat her fellow-American Taylor Townsend.
