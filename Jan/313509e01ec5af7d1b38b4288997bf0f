Tech giant Apple has announced that its first original feature film will reteam actor Bill Murray and director Sofia Coppola for a father-daughter comedy-drama called On the Rocks. According to the Hollywood Reporter, On the Rocks is about a young mother, played by Rashida Jones, who reconnects with her larger-than-life playboy father (Murray) on an adventure through New York. Coppola and Murray worked together on the 2003 comedy Lost in Translation, in which Murray played a jaded film star striking up an intense relationship with Scarlett Johansson’s bored photographer’s wife. Murray was Oscar-nominated for the role, while Coppola won the Academy award for best original screenplay. The film is the first fruit of Apple’s deal with A24, the US distributor behind such cult hits as Spring Breakers, Ex Machina and Moonlight. Reports suggest Apple is planning to invest more than $4bn (£3.1bn) in original content by 2022, with the vast majority to date going on TV programming such as a new Amazing Stories anthology from Steven Spielberg and untitled series from Damien Chazelle and M Night Shyamalan.
