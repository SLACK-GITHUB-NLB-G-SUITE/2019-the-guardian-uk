Bayern Munich have increased their offer for Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi to £35m, with the 18-year-old having reiterated his desire to leave Stamford Bridge this month. A bid worth £30m plus add-ons for the England youth forward was rejected, prompting Bayern to return with a deal they feel matches Chelsea’s valuation. Hudson-Odoi has refused to discuss a new contract with Chelsea, having been offered a five-year deal last summer. It is understood he is keen to establish himself as a first-team player at a time when his former England Under-17 teammates Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson have benefited from moves to Germany. On Monday Maurizio Sarri urged Hudson-Odoi to stay. “I don’t think a move to Germany would be good for him,” the Chelsea manager said. “He is an English player, he is very young and I think he has a very good future here; with the England team and with Chelsea. I think he is a very important player. “He is ready for the Premier League. Of course we have very important players in the same position and I can play with only two wingers. Three is difficult. But he is ready. Some times he will be on the bench but I think I can start to consider him on the same level as Willian and Pedro.”
