The first footage has emerged of Roe v Wade, a controversial anti-abortion film, which is part of conservative efforts to overturn the landmark 1973 US supreme court ruling that deemed abortion a fundamental right under the US constitution. Co-written and co-directed by entrepreneur Nick Loeb, who sued his former partner Sofía Vergara in an attempt to gain control over their frozen embryos, Roe v Wade is an explicitly pro-life statement that its makers claimed was shot in secret fearing harassment from pro-choice activists. This is an entirely separate project from one recently announced by UK producers Alison Owen and Debra Hayward, which will focus on lawyer Sarah Weddington, who represented “Roe” AKA Norma McCorvey, the Texan woman who challenged state law denying her an abortion. The trailer for Roe v Wade has been released online, and features high-profile entertainment industry conservatives such as Jon Voight and Stacey Dash: the former plays Warren Burger, the Nixon-nominated chief justice of the supreme court at the time of the ruling, while the latter plays Dr Mildred Jefferson, co-founder of the National Right to Life Committee. With dialogue such as: “We have been in our second civil war for over 50 years now”, “Doctors must protect life … from the point of conception”, and “This is a conspiracy”, Roe v Wade’s trailer leaves no doubt what its intentions are; it also features news items about Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court followed by the line, “It will flip the decision.” The makers plan to promote the film at the anti-abortion March for Life rally that is due to take place in Washington DC on 18 January, but as yet do not have release plans in place.
