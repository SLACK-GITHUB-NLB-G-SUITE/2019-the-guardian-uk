I met Freddy while I was at university. I introduced him to my sister. They hit it off and ended up in a relationship for six years. But then he got a new job and had to move away, and they broke up. By then, Freddy was a good friend and we kept in touch. I went travelling last year and heard Freddy was travelling, too, and that he would be homeless when he got back. I was planning to return at the same time, so I suggested we moved in together. My sister and I are very close. I don’t think she was best pleased – but only because she wanted me to move in with her. Perhaps she finds the situation a bit strange when she comes to visit, but it’s no big deal because I can go to her house instead. Freddy and I have a very intimate relationship, similar to that of a brother and sister. I feel protective about him. It’s a stronger bond than I have with any of my other friends. My friendship with Alice solidified when I was seeing her sister, Harriet, so I made an effort to keep in contact with her afterwards. Alice is an awesome person to have as a friend, and because the breakup with her sister was not traumatic, it meant Harriet and I stayed friends as well. I’m glad I don’t have to house-share with a stranger. We’re both quite laid-back, but because I work in art galleries installing exhibitions, I’m interested in the fine details of stuff. I’m probably quite annoying in that respect. I like things to be neat and tidy, and will make furniture to sort out a problem. Alice is really good at letting me do that stuff. I would happily buy a house with her. Living with her has made my life a whole lot better. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
