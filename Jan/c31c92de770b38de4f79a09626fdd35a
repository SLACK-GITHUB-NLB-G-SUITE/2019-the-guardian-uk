A veteran American cyclist has accepted a public warning issued by the US Anti-Doping Agency after being stripped of a world record he set earlier this year for failing a drugs test. Carl Grove set a new record when winning the 90-94 age group sprint title at the US Masters Track National Championships in July, only to test positive for epitrenbolone, a metabolite of trenbolon, which is a substance prohibited by Usada. The anti-doping rule violation was “more likely than not” to have been caused by the consumption of a contaminated piece of meat the night before the race, according to Usada. A test undertaken the day before had returned a negative result. The same in-competition urine test also revealed that a supplement the nonagenarian was using prior to the race in July was contaminated with clomiphene, another prohibited substance. The perils of eating contaminated meat made headlines in 2012 when Alberto Contador was handed a two-year ban and stripped of the 2010 Tour de France title after the controversial performance enhancing drug clenbuterol was found in his blood. The Spaniard blamed the positive result on suspect meat. Usada provides comprehensive instruction on its website on the testing process and prohibited substances, how to obtain permission to use a necessary medication, and the risks and dangers of taking supplements, as well as performance-enhancing and recreational drugs.
