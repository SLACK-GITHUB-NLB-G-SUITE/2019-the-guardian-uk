Paris Saint-Germain have said that Neymar will be out for about 10 weeks with the metatarsal injury he suffered against Racing Strasbourg on 23 January. The news will come as a blow to the French club as they prepare to face Manchester United in the Champions League, with the first leg to take place on 12 February at Old Trafford and the second on 6 March in Paris. The club will be less worried about their attempts to win Ligue 1 as they are 13 points ahead of Lille, having played two games fewer than the second-placed team. A club statement said: “After detailed analysis by the specialists, a consensus was reached of a conservative treatment of Neymar’s injury to the fifth right metatarsal. As a result, Neymar is expected to return to the field within ten weeks. “Paris Saint-Germain sends its strongest support and encouragement to Neymar to overcome this injury, with the courage and determination that the player has always shown.” Manchester United are undefeated since Ole Gunnar Solskjæer took over from José Mourinho on 19 December, having won eight of their games and drawing one, in the Premier League against Burnley on Tuesday night.
