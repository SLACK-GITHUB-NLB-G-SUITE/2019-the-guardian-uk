Bohemian Rhapsody director Bryan Singer has been accused of sexual misconduct by four men after an investigation published by the Atlantic magazine. All four allegations involve underage sex. Victor Valdovinos, who said he worked as an extra on Singer’s 1998 film Apt Pupil, claims that Singer sexually assaulted him when he was 13 years old, including “grabb[ing] my genitals and … masturbating it” in a locker room on the film set. Two other men – referred to pseudonymously as Eric and Andy – accuse Singer of having sex with them knowing they were under the age of consent of 18 in California, where the events allegedly took place. (They say they were 17 and 15 respectively.) Another man, named pseudonymously as Ben, said he had oral sex with Singer when he “was either 17 or 18”. Singer’s legal representative Andrew Brettler denied the allegations, and said that Singer has never been arrested for or charged with any crime and that Singer categorically denies ever having sex with, or a preference for, underage men. Brettler is described in the article as disputing a number of details, saying Valdovinos did not produce any documentation showing he had worked on Apt Pupil. In October, Singer posted a message on social media in anticipation of an article in Esquire magazine, accusing journalists of “a reckless disregard for the truth, making assumptions that are fictional and irresponsible”. In 2017, Singer denied accusations by Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, who had alleged that, as a 17-year-old in 2003, he was sexually assaulted by Singer on a yacht. Singer was fired from Bohemian Rhapsody before filming ended, but remains the sole credited director due to union regulations. Singer has consistently denied wrongdoing, and was recently reported to have been hired to direct a remake of the 1980s action flick Red Sonja.
