More than 400,000 new dollar millionaires were created last year as the fortunes of the already-well off ticked over into six-zeros despite the decline in global stock markets. It takes the number of millionaires across the world to 22.6 million. The global population of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), classed as those with between $1m and $30m (£775,000-£23.3m) in liquid assets, grew by 1.9% to 22.4 million in 2018, according to the research firm Wealth-X. On top of this there were a further 255,810 ultra-high-net-worth individuals with fortunes of more than $30m. The most millionaires are in the US, with 8.7 million, followed by China (1.9 million), Japan (1.6 million), Germany (1 million) and the UK (900,000). The UK’s HNWI population grew by 1.5%, with a combined wealth of $2.4bn, up $36m on the previous year. The UK’s richest person is Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the founder and chief executive of the petrochemicals firm Ineos and a high-profile Brexiter, with an estimated fortune of £21bn and two superyachts. Almost one million millionaires live in New York City, making it by far the biggest city for the wealthy. Tokyo is in second place with 593,000 millionaires, followed by Los Angeles with 576,000. Wealth has been growing fastest in Africa, according to the report. It predicted the number of dollar millionaires in oil-rich Nigeria would increase by 16% over the next five years. There are currently 29,500 millionaires in Nigeria, and the country’s richest person, Aliko Dangote, controls a $10bn fortune that makes him the world’s 134th most wealthy person. Egypt, where there are 22,000 millionaires, was expected to be the second-fastest growing at 12.5%.. In Asia, it predicted the number in Bangladesh would grow by 11.4%. This was despite one in four Bangladeshis living in poverty, according to World Bank figures. Wealth-X said: “The strong forecast growth for the countries above is a direct result of strong fundamental economic and financial forecasts in each of these markets,. “In addition to a relatively stable exchange rate against the US dollar (with the exception of Egypt which is forecast to see about 4% drop in its currency value against the dollar), the GDP (measured in current dollars) [was expected to] grow by between 9% and 13% year-on-year between 2018 and 2023.”
