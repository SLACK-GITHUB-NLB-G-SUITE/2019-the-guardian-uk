Manchester United have been handed the chance to exact FA Cup revenge when they travel to face the holders next month. United, who have won eight consecutive games since the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjær last month, will face a trip to Stamford Bridge in a tie which was the undoubted highlight of the fifth-round draw. Chelsea beat José Mourinho’s United 1-0 in last year’s somewhat forgettable final thanks to Eden Hazard’s penalty. Middlesbrough or Newport will host Manchester City while League One Doncaster will welcome Crystal Palace to the Keepmoat Stadium. AFC Wimbledon’s reward for beating West Ham is a home tie with Millwall, who knocked out Everton on Saturday evening. Frank Lampard’s Derby travel to either Brighton or West Brom while Bristol City will host either Shrewsbury or Wolves. Swansea are at home to Barnet or Brentford and the winner of the replay between Portsmouth and QPR will welcome Watford. The ties will take place between 15-18 February. Bristol City v Shrewsbury/Wolves, AFC Wimbledon v Millwall, Doncaster v Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough/Newport v Manchester City, Chelsea v Manchester United, Swansea v Barnet/Brentford, Portsmouth/QPR v Watford, Brighton/West Brom v Derby.
