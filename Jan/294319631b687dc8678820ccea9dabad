It was a victory that was “somewhat flattering,” as Kicker put it, and even Borussia Mönchengladbach’s coach Dieter Hecking admitted his side were “a bit lucky”. Yet all it ultimately meant was that Peter Bosz returned to coaching in the Bundesliga as he had left it just over 13 months ago – with defeat, as he took the reins at Bayer Leverkusen. It was rarely dull when the Dutchman was in charge at Borussia Dortmund, a short spell so out of kilter with current events that it’s almost as surreal as the extended period in which the leaders were glued to the foot of the table during Jürgen Klopp’s final campaign at the helm. If the evidence of his reintroduction to German football on Saturday afternoon is anything to go by, it is unlikely to be so this time either. Whether it will work out for Leverkusen is more open to debate, with plenty of promise displayed against Gladbach but no points to show for it in the final analysis. “We can say again that we played great, kept our opponents in check and deserved a goal,” a frustrated Lars Bender told Sky. “It’s disappointing.” That the visitors were more ruthless and composed was not a surprise, with Alessane Pléa scoring a well-crafted winner which takes the Frenchman to double figures for Gladbach at a faster rate than the legendary Jupp Heynckes managed back in the 1960s. They were excellent before the winter break and stay just three points behind Bayern Munich. Yet they were never comfortable here. For Matthias Ginter, making his comeback after suffering a fractured jaw and eye socket in a sickening clash of heads with Hannover’s Noah Sarenren Bazee in November, it was hardly a gentle way of easing oneself back into the swing of things. It was all hands to the pump for Gladbach for long spells, having just 36% possession and facing 22 efforts at goal from Leverkusen. So even if the result irked, there was a feeling of optimism in the BayArena corridors at full time. “You can see we’ve learned a lot over the past two weeks,” said Kai Havertz. “We did a lot of things better today than we did in the Hinrunde.” The 19-year-old also praised Bosz for being “great at dealing with young players” which, as he pointed out, “is especially important in Leverkusen”. Getting a talent of Havertz’s stature onside is a great start to Bosz’s stewardship. Havertz, Julian Brandt and Leon Bailey, whose focus has drifted in recent months, were all included in a new, ultra-attacking line-up. After the plod of the closing months of Heiko Herrlich’s tenure, it feels like a relief. “The result is disappointing of course, but the way we played wasn’t. I’m convinced that we’ll have a lot of fun in the second half of the season,” said long-serving sporting director, Rudi Völler. Therein, perhaps, lies at least some of the difference between the context of Bosz’s difficulties at Dortmund and what he is adapting to with Die Werkself. In summer 2017 Bosz arrived at a club lacking direction upstairs, that accordingly didn’t really know what they wanted. He was the second choice for the role; eventual incumbent Lucien Favre, pretty much Bosz’s polar opposite, was the first. He inherited a team bruised from internal strife under Thomas Tuchel, still processing the aftermath of the bus attack – and an uneven squad fettered by big expectations. At Leverkusen, nobody’s expecting to chase the summit and the aim of making Europe – as Bosz pointed out post-match – is very doable with 16 matches to go and only a four-point gap. “I think we’re on a good path,” he said. With the new man’s ideas already crystal clear to his players, the route is in no doubt. Seatbelts will be required. • With it now seeming unlikely that Atlético Madrid’s Lucas Hernández will arrive in this window, the Callum Hudson-Odoi transfer having hit an impasse of sorts and Benjamin Pavard only arriving from Stuttgart in the summer, it appears Bayern Munich may largely have to get on with what they have. Good for them, then, that they got the Rückrunde under way in ominous fashion on Friday, winning 3-1 at Hoffenheim with no need for some of the squad’s elder elements. Leon Goretzka led the way with a brace and Bayern looked the part as they temporarily closed the gap at the top to three points behind Borussia Dortmund, and Kovac made it clear he is relishing the chance to put pressure on the leaders. “Now they have to react,” he said after the game. • Dortmund did just that, becoming the first team to win at Leipzig this season in Saturday’s late game, by a single goal via Axel Witsel’s thunderous finish from a Raphaël Guerreiro corner. This was exactly the sort of gritty win that potential champions need to get – and achieved without Marco Reus, the captain nursing a minor knock and not even named as a substitute. Reus continued to lead from the front, though, taking a seat on the touchline and encouraging his teammates in the dressing room, and it was that kind of all-hands-on-deck effort. Julian Weigl shone as a makeshift centre-back, and Roman Bürki made some important saves. Little wonder Favre told Sky he was “extremely satisfied”. What a strike! Blink and you'll miss it! ⚡️Dortmund stay 6️⃣ points clear at the top and have Axel Witsel to thank 💛 pic.twitter.com/wEL0zFEgKn • The last game of the weekend already felt like a big one for Schalke, with Domenico Tedesco’s team facing in-form Wolfsburg on the back of a very disappointing Hinrunde – and having moved on accordingly since, with iconic veteran centre-back Naldo joining Monaco and goalkeeper/captain Ralf Fährmann left out. It all fell into place – just – with Daniel Caligiuri firing a stylish late winner having earlier opened the scoring from the penalty spot. Fährmann faced a bevy of lurking photographers as he took his seat on the bench, though Tedesco insisted his dropping for Alexander Nübel wasn’t a “final decision”. He was just “getting a break”, according to sporting director Christian Heidel. • Eintracht Frankfurt’s “Büffelherde” of Sébastien Haller, Ante Rebic and Luka Jovic were quickly rampaging again, getting a goal each to take them to a win over Freiburg and close the gap on the top four to a point. They now have 29 goals and 17 assists between them, with Jovic’s strike taking him top of the Bundesliga scoring charts. • There’s little change at the bottom, with 17th and 18th-placed Hannover and Nürnberg beaten at home by Werder Bremen and Hertha, respectively. The former’s defeat would have been a humiliation without a standout display from goalkeeper Michael Esser. Stuttgart have been imaginative in this transfer window but defensive disarray in a 3-2 home reverse to Mainz – which kept them in the play-off spot – suggested teenage centre-back Ozan Kabak, signed from Galatasaray last week, might be expected to chip in sooner rather than later. Schalke 2-1 Wolfsburg, Nürnberg 1-3 Hertha Berlin, Leipzig 0-1 Dortmund, Augsburg 1-2 Fortuna Dusseldorf, Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1 Freiburg, Hannover 0-1 Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Stuttgart 2-3 Mainz, Hoffenheim 1-3 Bayern Munich
