Coachella, the Californian festival that kicks off the summer of outdoor live music, has announced its 2019 lineup. Taking place in Indio on 12-14 and 19-21 April, the opening night is headlined by Childish Gambino, AKA rapper, singer, writer, actor and comedian Donald Glover. His track This Is America was one of the most talked-about of 2018, while his album Awaken, My Love! was a Grammy-winning US hit in 2017. Saturday night is headlined by Australian psych-rock band Tame Impala, who announced the news on Twitter promising “New year. New shows. New sounds”, suggesting a follow-up to their 2015 album Currents will be released this year. They have recently been embraced by the kind of rap and R&B stars that populate Coachella’s lineup, having been sampled by Rihanna, A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott. Closing out the festival will be Ariana Grande, the pop star who has weathered very public traumas – the Manchester arena attack, the death of former boyfriend Mac Miller, the breakdown of her engagement to comedian Pete Davidson – to become more popular than ever in 2018: her album Sweetener topped the US and UK charts in September. Other big names across the weekend are R&B singers Solange, Khalid, Janelle Monáe, H.E.R and Ella Mai; rappers Juice WRLD, Bad Bunny, Kid Cudi and Anderson .Paak; EDM stars Zedd, Diplo, Dillon Francis and DJ Snake; and British talent including the 1975, Aphex Twin and Blood Orange.
