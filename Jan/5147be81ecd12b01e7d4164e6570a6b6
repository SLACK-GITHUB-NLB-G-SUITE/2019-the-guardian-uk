The NFL is looking into reports that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was targeted with a laser pointer during his team’s victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Pictures from Kansas City TV station KMBC appear to show a laser was pointed at Brady just before he threw an interception late in the game. KMBC’s William Joy tweeted footage of a green light around Brady’s head and upper torso. The game was played at the Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium. Our photographer, Turner Twyman, caught someone pointing what appears to be a laser pointer in Tom Brady's face last night. Play between the "muff" that wasn't and Sorensen int. @NFL, @Patriots and @Chiefs all told me they weren't aware of the incident. pic.twitter.com/ejWBQ6i64C The laser was also seen during two key completions by Brady to receivers Chris Hogan and Rob Gronkowski. The Patriots said they had “no comment” on the matter but an NFL spokesman told the Boston Herald the league is “looking into the report of the laser beam”. Brady doesn’t seem to have been badly affected. He did not mention any lasers in his post-game comments and led two late drives as the Patriots won the game 37-31 to reach next month’s Super Bowl.
