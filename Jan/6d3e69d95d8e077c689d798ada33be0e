Ole Gunnar Solskjær believes Marouane Fellaini has an “X-factor” for Manchester United and has indicated the midfielder will not be sold in this transfer window. Fellaini, who is injured, has played only 31 minutes of the interim manager’s six games yet Solskjær believes the 31-year-old can have an important role under him. “There’s X-factor in different players and we all know Felli’s X-factor,” he said. “He’ll probably be at least three or four weeks [out] – he’s got a calf problem and that’s sad. But he’ll be working hard to get back in when all the big games are coming.” Brighton & Hove Albion are at Old Trafford on Saturday as Solskjær aims for a seventh consecutive win. “You cannot be too confident,” he said. “Confidence is one thing, complacency is the other side of it, that you think it’s going to be easy. “I want players to be confident but I don’t want them to be complacent and take their foot off the pedal because that’s a big difference for me. I want them going into the games full of confidence, taking people on, playing, running, passing forward, getting the crowd with them because that’s what it’s about.” Scott McTominay has hardly featured under Solskjær but the 22-year-old midfielder, who signed a new deal last season, may not go on loan. “Scott is working hard, he’s a young boy I still believe in, and we’re working on his contract. With the injuries of Felli as well and the squad we have I’m not too sure we’re going to see any movement at all.”
