The son of James Gandolfini is to take on the late actor’s most recognisable role, by playing Tony Soprano in the film prequel to acclaimed series The Sopranos. Michael Gandolfini, 19, will appear as a younger version of the New Jersey mob boss in The Many Saints of Newark. The film, which is currently in pre-production, is set in 1967 and recalls the race riots between Italian- and African-Americans in the city. In a statement Michael Gandolfini said, “it’s a profound honour to continue my dad’s legacy while stepping into the shoes of a young Tony Soprano. “I’m thrilled that I am going to have the opportunity to work with David Chase and the incredible company of talent he has assembled for The Many Saints of Newark.” James Gandolfini, who died of a heart attack in 2013 aged 51, found fame and critical acclaim with his portrait of Tony Soprano, a violent mobster who seeks help from a therapist after suffering panic attacks. In total the actor received three Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for his performance in the series, which aired from 1999 to 2007. Currently without a release date, The Many Saints of Newark is written by Sopranos creator David Chase and will centre on the character of Dickie Moltisanti, father to series regular Christopher Moltisanti, as he mentors Tony. Vera Farmiga, Alessandro Nivola and Jon Bernthal are among the actors cast in the film, which will be directed by Alan Taylor, who directed multiple episodes of the original series. Michael Gandolfini is currently appearing in David Simon’s HBO series The Deuce and had a minor role in 2018 heist movie Ocean’s 8.
