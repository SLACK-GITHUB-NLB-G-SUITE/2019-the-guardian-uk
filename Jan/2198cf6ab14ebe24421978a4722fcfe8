Authorities in Tokyo have launched an investigation into a work of graffiti that bears a striking resemblance to a trademark drawing by the celebrated – and so far unidentified – British street artist, Banksy. Tokyo’s metropolitan government was alerted to a drawing of a rat holding an umbrella – one of Banksy’s best-known works – on a door near a Hinode monorail station in the city centre. “We think there’s a possibility it was done by Banksy,” Koji Sugiyama, a government official said. あのバンクシーの作品かもしれないカワイイねずみの絵が都内にありました！ 東京への贈り物かも？ カバンを持っているようです。 pic.twitter.com/aPBVAq3GG3 The discovery even prompted a comment from Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, who posted photos of the work on Twitter, along with the message: “There’s a painting of cute rat in Tokyo which could be Banksy’s work! A gift to Tokyo?” The government has since removed the door, which is designed to prevent flooding during high tides, and placed it in storage to prevent damage to the work. Reports said it was unclear exactly when the drawing had appeared, but the city’s public safety bureau has reportedly known about it for a long time. Other publicly circulated photos of the image date back several years. Officials were not aware that Banksy may have been behind the drawing until they were contacted by residents in December. Sugiyama said the government hoped to establish the artist’s identity, but conceded that Japan suffered from a shortage of Banksy experts. Banksy recently hit the headlines when one of his artworks shredded itself soon after selling for £1.04m auction.
