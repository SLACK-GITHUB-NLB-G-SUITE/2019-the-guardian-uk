Cut 2 medium-sized leeks into 2cm-thick rounds. Rinse thoroughly in cold water. Put the still-wet leeks into a pan with 30g of butter and cover loosely with a disc of greaseproof paper and a lid, then set over a moderate heat. Steam the leeks for 7-8 minutes, making sure they don’t colour. Grate 250g of beetroot into the leeks, then pour in 150ml of double cream, season with salt and black pepper then simmer for 8 minutes, or until thick and the leeks are thoroughly soft. Set aside. Take 2 chicken breasts, each weighing approximately 100g and place them on a piece of baking parchment. Fold the paper over the meat and bat out with a rolling pin or cutlet bat until the size of a small dinner plate. Break a large egg into a shallow bowl and beat lightly to mix yolks and whites. Scatter 100g of breadcrumbs over a shallow bowl or plate. Dip the pieces of meat into the beaten egg and then on to the crumbs, pressing firmly so the crumbs form an even crust. Warm 3 tbsp of sunflower or olive oil in a shallow pan. Lower in the “schnitzels” and cook until golden. Serve with the beetroot and leek cream. Enough for 2. A heavy cutlet bat is best for flattening the chicken breasts, but a rolling pin will do. Protect the chicken by covering the meat with a piece of greaseproof or waxed paper. Use slices of turkey breast instead of the chicken. Season the breadcrumbs with grated pecorino and very finely chopped rosemary. Serve with wide buttered noodles, perhaps with a few crushed green peppercorns or capers. Email Nigel at nigel.slater@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @NigelSlater
