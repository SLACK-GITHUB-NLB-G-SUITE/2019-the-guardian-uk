Here is a truly terrible Working Girl knock-off, fronted by Jennifer Lopez on her most stately and self-conscious form, embedded in a pastiche 80s-aspirational New York world in which cast members break out their karaoke version of Salt-N-Pepa’s Push It. The film does, however, have an unusual development that plays on that rare thing: the second act in American lives and indeed in American movies. Lopez plays Maya, a woman in her forties, living out in Queens (for Melanie Griffith it was Staten Island), vibrant but with some personal sadness in her heart. She is working in a big store and can see clearly how its productivity and customer relations could be improved, but Maya never went to college, so useless guys with MBAs get promoted over her head. As she calls them: “The educated people in their fancy houses who name their children after fruit.” Then her hilarious madcap pals fake a CV for her with Harvard degrees and the like, without her knowing, and send it off to a fancy Manhattan beauty product corporation. So Maya finds herself installed in a chi-chi corner office by the dishy silver-fox CEO (Treat Williams), who is bowled over by her combination of street smarts and Ivy League record. And it isn’t long before Maya finds herself in a face-off with an icily manicured younger executive, Zoe, played by Vanessa Hudgens. Well, this isn’t the whole story, but that all-important second act turns out to be as flimsily constructed and ridiculous as everything else. And there’s a toe-curling moment that could have been written by Ricky Gervais: Maya has a eureka idea for a new skincare product based on leaves from the gingko tree that survived Hiroshima. That’s right! Hiroshima! Inspiring skincare! Feelgood or what?
