At the grand age of 38, Peter Crouch is back in the Premier League. The former England striker, who has been used sparingly by Championship side Stoke City this season, made the move to Burnley – on a deal until the end of the season – with Sam Vokes heading in the opposite direction. The 6ft 7in striker, whose long list of former clubs takes in Liverpool, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Portsmouth and Southampton, among others, has a record of 108 goals in 462 games in the Premier League. “I still want to achieve things. I want to get more games in the Premier League and I would love to add to the 100 Premier League goals,” Crouch said. “My game has probably changed a little bit. I’m not 25. But my attributes haven’t waned. I never really had blistering pace, so I haven’t lost that. I’ll be doing as well as I can this year, and who knows after that? I remember when Mark Hughes was manager [at Stoke]. I think he played until he was 40-odd and that was a target I had. I’d love to do that and hopefully I can do that in the Premier League with Burnley.” Announcing... 🤖@petercrouch pic.twitter.com/AsqauruKHp Burnley’s manager, Sean Dyche, does not feel Crouch’s age makes him any less of a player. “I’ve always admired that Crouchy knows what he is, and isn’t really bothered about other people’s opinions,” he said. “I’m not really too bothered about his age. We know he’s a good character and he still has a desire. The main thing for me is having motivated people.” Vokes, meanwhile, has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Stoke, who paid an undisclosed sum for the Wales international. Stoke manager Nathan Jones said: “Sam is a player of real pedigree, he has been promoted from this level and he’s an experienced international and Premier League player. To get it done is something totally different to anything we have and we think he’s a marquee player for this level.”
