The World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have condemned Tottenham Hotspur supporters’ use of the nickname “Yids” and called for fans to take a stand against using the term during matches. Three Spurs fans were arrested in 2014 for using the word during a Europa League game, with the Football Association and anti-racism group Kick It Out having repeatedly urged supporters not to use it. But after reports of antisemitic chanting after Chelsea’s fixture at Brighton before Christmas and at Arsenal’s defeat to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, the WJC and BOD urged supporters to “take a stand” against abusive language. “Contrary to the protests of many fans, there is no grey area when it comes to slurs that target a particular religious, racial or ethnic group,” said the WJC CEO and executive vice-president, Robert Singer. “The word ‘Yid’ has for years been reappropriated from its original Yiddish to carry a distinctly pejorative and antisemitic message, and its use by fans in the stands, either as a self-designated nickname or as a slogan against rivals must not be tolerated in any way. “There has sadly been a long history of hooliganism and extremist behaviour within football, particularly in England, and we hope that the actions being taken in good faith by Chelsea’s leadership to take punitive measures against any supporters that violate this code of conduct will help establish the groundwork for more tolerance among fans of all teams. “We would also ask Tottenham Hotspur to take a stand against the use of ‘Yid Army’, ‘Yid’ and ‘Yiddos’ by their fans. Such a long overdue action is important to kick antisemitism off the pitch and create a welcoming environment for all.” A supporter was ejected from the Emirates Stadium following a physical altercation in the North Bank after being accused of making numerous antisemitic references during Spurs’ 2-0 win at Arsenal in December.
