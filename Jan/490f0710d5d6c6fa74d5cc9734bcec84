Millions of EU citizens resident in the UK will be able to register for the new post-Brexit “settled status” from 21 January. The Home Office is extending its live trial to all EU citizens who hold a valid passport and any non-EU citizen family members who hold a valid biometric residence card. It is the third phase of the trial, and a large portion of the estimated 3.5 to 3.8 million EU nationals living in the UK are expected to be eligible to apply. The rollout comes weeks after a series of bugs were exposed in the phone app, which does not work on iPhones, including complaints that the passport recognition function did not work on allAndroid models. Some universities participating in the second stage of the trial in November and December resorted to buying a supply of phones that did work. The second phase was open to 250,000 people in selected universities, health and social care bodies. But only 15,500 applications were made, of which 12,400 had been concluded by 13 December. The Home Office said 71% of applicants had been granted settled status with the remainder granted pre-settled status, which is given to those who have been in the country for more fewer than five years. There was positive feedback from 77% of applicants but 10% of applicants were unable to use the identity verification function of the app, in line with reports of technical glitches. The Home Office now says it is “well on track” to deliver an easy-to-use system for universal use when it launches officially on 30 March. It stressed the next phase of the registration trial was “completely voluntary” and if a Brexit deal were struck EU nationals would have until June 2021 to apply for registered status.
