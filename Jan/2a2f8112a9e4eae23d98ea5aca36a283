David Beckham has become a shareholder in Salford City, taking a 10% stake and so joining Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes as Class of 92 owners. Beckham’s acquisition of his stake from Peter Lim makes the Class of 92 majority shareholders, the Singapore businessman retaining 40%. Beckham said: “It’s a proud moment for me to join Peter Lim and the Class of 92 lads as an owner of Salford City. My early years in Manchester were spent in Salford – I grew up there in many ways – so to be able to finally join the lads today is a great feeling. Salford City has achieved so much success in a short space of time, the fans are incredible and I’m really excited to be spending more time in Salford again.” The Class of 92 said: “From the very beginning we wanted David to be involved and be with us on this incredible journey; however circumstances and commitments didn’t allow that. Now the time is right and its another exciting chapter in Salford City’s history. It is important to emphasise that nothing will change in the day-to-day operations but to have us all together was always the vision.” The Class of 92 bought the club in 2014 with Salford in the Northern Premier League Division One North. The club became full-time in 2017 and play in the National League following three promotions. They are one point off top spot, with the division’s winners earning automatic promotion to League Two.
