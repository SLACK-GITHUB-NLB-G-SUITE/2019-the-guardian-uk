Hugh McIlvanney, one of the most respected voices in British sports journalism, has died aged 84. McIlvanney, who was the Observer’s chief sports correspondent for 30 years until 1993, covered some of the most significant sporting events of the 20th century, including the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 and England’s World Cup win in 1966. He retired after 60 years in the profession in 2016, after spending 23 years with the Sunday Times. RIP Hugh McIlvanney, Britain's greatest sports writer, and my chum. We argued like cat and dog, but always made up. And when you were having a proper barney with Hugh, his use of language (he spoke as elegantly as he wrote) made you secretly glad you were fighting. #genius pic.twitter.com/B9wy7dmbHC Tributes poured in for the award-winning Scot, who was described as “one of the true greats of sportswriting, “a giant of journalism” and “the literary equivalent of Stein and Shankley”. McIlvanney, who was best known for his coverage of boxing and football, was awarded an OBE in 1996 and named British sports writer of the year seven times.
