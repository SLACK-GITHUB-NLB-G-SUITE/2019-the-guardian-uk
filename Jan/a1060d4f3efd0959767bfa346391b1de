MPs will vote on four amendments to the Brexit deal motion on Tuesday. Here are the details of who tabled them and what they mean. Proposed by Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and others, this seeks to rule out a no-deal departure and criticises May’s plan for not providing “a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal”, which Labour says would harm business and could mean the Irish backstop coming into force. Slightly cheekily, the Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to this amendment suggesting that where Labour promises to pursue every option to prevent a no-deal exit, it should add “including a public vote as endorsed by the Labour party conference 2018”. Put down by both parties’ frontbenches, this condemns the deal on the basis that it “would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole”. It calls instead for an extension of article 50 so that a new plan can be made. Amendment B seeks to limit the scope of the Irish backstop by insisting it is temporary and by saying international law decrees the UK can unilaterally end the withdrawal agreement if there is any attempt to extend it beyond 2021. It has been proposed by Leigh, a veteran Tory backbencher, and is backed by 12 other Brexiters. A second amendment by Leigh states essentially the same thing in more detail. Another amendment focused on the backstop and backed by a series of Tory Brexiters. This simply states that the UK would have the right to terminate the backstop without the say-so of the EU.
