The Duke of Edinburgh has escaped unhurt after the car he was driving was involved in an accident close to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Police were called to the scene of a collision involving 97-year-old Prince Philip on Thursday. Witnesses told the BBC that the Range Rover being driven by Philip had overturned after pulling out from a driveway on the A149. He was helped out of the car by eyewitnesses and was reportedly conscious but very shocked and shaken. The palace would not confirm if he was alone in the vehicle at the time of the collision. A Buckingham Palace statement said: “The Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a road traffic accident with another vehicle this afternoon. The duke was not injured. The accident took place close to the Sandringham Estate. Local police attended the scene.” Philip, who retired from public life in August 2017, has been staying with the Queen at Sandringham since Christmas. Prince Philip was seen by a doctor as a precautionary measure who confirmed he was not injured, the palace said. Norfolk police said officers were called to the Sandringham Estate shortly before 3pm “following reports of a collision involving two cars”. A police spokesman said police and ambulance crews attended, and two people in one of the vehicles suffered minor injuries.
