Thirty years ago, the Observer Magazine asked its readers to nominate the British buildings they loved or hated the most (11 June 1989, ‘The best and worst buildings in Britain’). ‘One man’s Mies is another man’s Poulson’ was the rather brilliant concession that such an exercise was, of course, highly subjective. The poll reflected the general architectural conservatism of the UK – ‘old equals good and new equals bad’. The clear favourite was Durham Cathedral: ‘The great Norman resting place of Cuthbert and Bede in its spectacular high loop above the Wear.’ The National Theatre in London was voted the worst: ‘It looks like a warehouse for tinned food.’ But even some revered older buildings came in for criticism: St Paul’s is ‘a snail, slithering across the city’; Buckingham Palace is ‘like an early unsuccessful timeshare’. The fact that the focus was almost entirely on exteriors of buildings surely owed something to the Prince of Wales, who made his infamous ‘monstrous carbuncle’ speech in 1984 and who compared the National Theatre to a nuclear power station. Max Hutchinson, Riba president-elect at the time, said the prince was ‘having an enormous influence on the public perception of architecture, but not on its understanding’. Quite a lot of the buildings didn’t fare so well in the subsequent years: the Arndale Centre in Manchester (third most hated) was blown up by the IRA in 1996; the Glasgow School of Art (10th best) has been hit by two devastating fires; the brutalist Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth was demolished in 2004; and the postmodernist Observer building was demolished in 2014. ‘An architectural lie, cold, lifeless, rotten, a fake, phoney, an indication of cowardice, pathetic mock classical mess’ were some of the readers’ damning descriptions of the latter. It was somehow apt that the building – with its Chippendale broken pediment and barcode facade – became the headquarters for the QVC shopping channel – a fate worse than demolition.
