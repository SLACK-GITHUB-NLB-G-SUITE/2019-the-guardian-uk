Juventus are confident of signing Aaron Ramsey when his Arsenal contract expires at the end of the season after holding productive talks with the Wales midfielder’s representatives. The Italian champions, whose sporting director Fabio Paratici admitted this week that Ramsey is on their radar, have already offered the 28-year-old a five-year contract worth €6.5m (£5.87m) a season in a bid to see of interest from several other European clubs including Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal withdrew their offer of a new deal last September meaning he is now free to negotiate with overseas clubs and sign a pre-contract. It is understood that Juventus are now in pole position to sign him and have even enquired over the possibility of signing Ramsey during the January transfer window, although Arsenal are at this stage reluctant to sanction that move. Reports in Italy have stated that Germany international Sami Khedira could be allowed to leave as part of any deal. Internazionale, Real Madrid and an unnamed Chinese club have also been linked with an approach for Ramsey. He joined Arsenal from Cardiff in 2008 for £5m and is the club’s longest-serving player. He has won three FA Cups with them, scoring the winning goals in the 2014 and 2017 finals against Hull and Chelsea respectively.
