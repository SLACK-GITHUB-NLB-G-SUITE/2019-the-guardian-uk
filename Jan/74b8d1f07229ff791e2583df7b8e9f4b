Edinburgh remain on course for their first Champions Cup quarter-final since 2012, beating Toulon 28-17 to become only the third team to win at Stade Felix Mayol in the competition. Richard Cockerill’s side hit back after conceding a try in the second minute of the game and dominated territory and possession throughout to make it four wins in a row and set up a winner-takes-all encounter in the Scottish capital with Montpellier. Cockerill had challenged his players to make a piece of history by becoming the first Scottish team to win at Stade Mayol and a stunning second-half display earned them only their third victory on French soil in 18 games. Scarlets avenged their Pool 4 defeat at Welford Road earlier in the season with a convincing 33-10 victory over Leicester at Parc-y-Scarlets. With both sides already out of the competition, Leicester chose to field a weakened team with no sign of George Ford, Jonny May and Manu Tuilagi in their lineup and they were made to pay as the hosts ran in five tries. The prop Rob Evans scored two of them, Ken Owens, Steff Evans and Johnny McNicholl the others with Dan Jones adding four conversions. Will Evans and Mike Fitzgerald scored consolation tries for Leicester. Newcastle, struggling at the foot of the Premiership, made a meek exit from Europe with a Champions Cup defeat at Montpellier, the French side hammering the Falcons 45-8. Jacob Stockdale gave Eddie Jones another reminder of the danger he will pose to England next month with two more tries in Ulster’s pulsating 26-22 win over Racing 92 in Belfast. The Ireland wing scored in each half, his second a memorable solo effort.
