The Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón has attacked Netflix’s decision to offer Iberian Spanish subtitles for his Mexico City-set film Roma, calling it “parochial, ignorant and offensive to Spaniards themselves”. The semi-autobiographical film, which tells the story of Cleo, a maid to a middle-class Mexican family in the 1970s, has already won a string of awards and is nominated for a best film Bafta. It is also heavily tipped as an Oscars frontrunner. But while Cuarón has thanked Netflix for its support as the film’s distributor, he has questioned the streaming firm’s wisdom in offering Iberian Spanish subtitles when the film’s Mexican Spanish dialogue would hardly flummox viewers in Spain. “I think it’s very offensive to the Spanish public that they’ve given Roma Iberian Spanish subtitles,” the director told the Spanish news agency Efe on Tuesday. He went further the following day, telling El País: “It’s parochial, ignorant and offensive to Spaniards themselves. One of the things I most enjoy is the colour and texture of other accents.” The decision, he added, was akin to providing non-Iberian Spanish subtitles for a Pedro Almodóvar film. Cuarón’s concerns echoed those expressed last month by the Mexican writer Jordi Soler. The author called it “paternalistic, offensive and profoundly provincial”, and questioned the need to change perfectly obvious second-person plurals for a peninsular Spanish audience. “To top it all off,” he wrote on Twitter, “when they say ‘mamá’ [mum], the subtitles say ‘madre’ [mother].” On a more technical level, El País’s report also quibbled over the decision to change the Mexican chocolate snack gansito to the Spanish ganchito, which is a savoury relative of the Wotsit. Netflix have been approached for comment.
