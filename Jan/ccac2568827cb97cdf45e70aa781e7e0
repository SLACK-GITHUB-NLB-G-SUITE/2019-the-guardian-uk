The pop star Robbie Williams is “blasting Black Sabbath music” at his neighbour, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, over a home extension row, a complaint to their local council has said. The musicians, who live in Holland Park, west London, clashed after the ex-Take That singer was granted conditional approval last year to build a basement swimming pool. Page is concerned the excavation work will damage his 1875 Grade I-listed mansion. A letter to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council, which is signed “Jonny”, says that Williams has been playing Black Sabbath to annoy his neighbour. It also states the singer has played Pink Floyd and Deep Purple songs at high volume, knowing “this upsets” the Led Zeppelin star. The correspondent adds that Williams has also dressed up to imitate Led Zeppelin’s frontman Robert Plant by “wearing a long hair wig, and stuffing a pillow under his shirt in an attempt to mock or imitate Mr Robert Plant’s beer belly that he has acquired in his older age”. This is “embarrassing”, the letter continues, because “Mr Plant was remembered for performing with his shirt open on stage, and obviously he cannot perform in his current condition”. Williams was granted planning permission in December but work cannot begin until councillors receive reassurance that vibration levels and ground movement issues will be monitored. They will also decide whether to ask Williams for a bond, which could be forfeited if those conditions were breached or Page’s property was damaged.
