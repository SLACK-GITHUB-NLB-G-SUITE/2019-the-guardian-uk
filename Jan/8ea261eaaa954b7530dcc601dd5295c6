A friend recently mentioned someone she had met at a lesbian Botox party. “A what?” I asked. “A Botox party,” she repeated. “Don’t you know about Botox parties?” While her face was expressionless, her voice was incredulous. “Seriously, how have you never heard of this?” After some frantic Googling, I had no idea how I had never heard of Botox parties. Apparently, it has become all the rage to get a group of friends together at someone’s house for wine, nibbles and cosmetic injections of botulinum toxin from a medical professional. Everyone pays a set amount to attend and it is cheaper and more comfortable than going to a doctor. Because the effect of Botox wears off after a few months, these parties are regular social events. “It’s a good way to catch up with people,” my friend said. The party she goes to is all gay women and invite-only. These gatherings aren’t just favoured by middle-aged lesbians. Botox’s popularity in the US, particularly among young people, has rocketed since it was approved there for cosmetic use in 2002. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has noted a dramatic increase in patients under 30 getting “preventative” Botox in recent years. This has been fuelled, in part, by Instagram culture. And Botox parties have been mainstreamed by reality TV shows such as Real Housewives. The rise of Botox parties is troubling for several reasons. It’s troubling that so many of us have an issue with ageing naturally. It’s troubling that people are drinking and driving needles into their face. It’s also troubling that I have never been to one of these parties when, apparently every other gay in New York has. Not that I want Botox – I am just upset I haven’t been invited. But it’s OK. I’m keeping a stiff upper lip about it.
