Arsenal are hopeful of signing Barcelona’s Denis Suárez in the January transfer window. The Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, is an admirer of the 24-year-old central midfielder, having worked with him at Sevilla during the 2014-15 season. Suárez, who spent two years at Manchester City as an academy player between 2011 and 2013, has played 46 league matches for Barcelona in two and a half seasons but never been able to hold down a regular starting place. The Spaniard, who has one international cap, won in 2016, is under contract with Barcelona until 2020 and would cost around £20m. He has played 221 minutes this season but only 17 of them in the league. The two clubs have opened talks and there is a keenness on both sides to get the deal over the line this month. Arsenal are set to lose Aaron Ramsey on a free transfer in the summer with Juventus favourites to sign the 28-year-old. Southampton are in talks with Sampdoria regarding the potential sale of Manolo Gabbiadini. The two clubs are discussing a loan until the end of the season with an obligation to buy the striker in the summer for a fee in the region of £9m. However, Sampdoria first need to offload another forward, probably Grégoire Defrel or Gianluca Caprari. Gabbiadini, who joined from Napoli for £15m in January 2017, has had an uneven spell at St Mary’s. The striker started his career with a bang, scoring six goals in his first four games, including one against Manchester United in the League Cup final, but his form dipped and has been in and out of the team for the past 18 months. Gabbiadini has one goal in 15 appearances this season and the new Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, has not included the 27-year-old in his past five matchday squads.
