Everton are attempting to sign Michy Batshuayi on a permanent deal from Chelsea, with the Belgium striker expected to cost around £35m. Batshuayi spent the first half of this season on loan at Valencia but has not made an appearance since the beginning of the month as the Spanish side attempt to cut short his spell. Despite interest from West Ham in taking him on loan, Chelsea have been searching for a permanent option for the 25-year-old and have held talks with Everton over a potential move, with the Londoners demanding more than the £33m they paid to sign him from Marseille in 2016. Batshuayi still has more than two years remaining on his contract at Stamford Bridge but having already signed Kurt Zouma on loan from Chelsea, Marco Silva’s side are only able to pursue a permanent deal but are confident an agreement can be reached before Thursday’s deadline. Any deal may still depend on whether they can agree a fee with Paris Saint-Germain for midfielder Idrissa Gueye, however. The French champions had a £21.5m bid rejected last week. Meanwhile, Leicester are primed to announce the loan signing of the Belgium midfielder, Youri Tielemans, from Monaco, with Adrien Silva, the Portugal midfielder, going in the opposite direction, also on loan until the end of the season. Neither deal has the option for a permanent transfer.
