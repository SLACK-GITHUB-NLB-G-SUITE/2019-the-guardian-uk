Alfonso Cuarón’s nostalgic evocation of a 1970s Mexican childhood emerged as the big winner at the Critics’ Choice film awards on Sunday, picking up four awards including best film, and solidifying its place as a serious contender for the big Oscar prizes next month. As well as best picture, Roma won best director and best cinematography for Cuarón personally, and best foreign language film. The Critics’ Choice pick for best picture has coincided with the Oscars’ seven times in the last decade, and as such is seen as a vital indicator for which way the Academy will jump. Despite not being eligible for best picture at the Golden Globes, Roma’s Oscar odds shortened after its three-award performance there, currently at 6/4 for best picture. The Favourite, the scabrous black comedy of power struggles at the court of Queen Anne in the early 18th century, had led the nominations list with 14 nods, but took home only two: best actress in a comedy for Olivia Colman, who plays Anne, and best acting ensemble. Colman failed to win the best actress award, which was shared by Glenn Close for her remarkable turn as the frustrated wife of a Nobel prize-winning author in The Wife, and Lady Gaga as the newly discovered singer in A Star Is Born. Voted for by the 300-strong Broadcast Film Critics Association, the awards lineup also found room for more commercially-oriented releases. Afro-futurist superhero movie Black Panther won for best production design, best costume design and best visual effects, Singapore-set romcom Crazy Rich Asians taking best comedy, Mission Impossible – Fallout taking best action movie and dialogue-light alien thriller A Quiet Place taking best sci-fi or horror movie. In the TV section of the awards, the final series of deep-cover spy series The Americans dominated the drama categories (winning best drama series, best actor in a drama series for Matthew Rhys, and best supporting actor for Noah Emmerich) with 50s-set standup comedy series The Marvelous Mrs Maisel ruling the roost in comedy (best comedy series, best actress in a comedy series for Rachel Brosnahan, and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Alex Borstein). The TV awards also produced a tie, with Amy Adams (Sharp Objects) and Patricia Arquette (Escape at Dannemora) receiving joint best actress in a limited series or TV movie. Barry and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story won two awards each: Bill Hader and Henry Winkler took best actor and supporting actor in a comedy series, while American Crime Story won best limited series and best actor for Darren Criss.
