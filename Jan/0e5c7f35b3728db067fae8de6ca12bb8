The former British and world No 1 Andy Murray has posted pictures on Instagram after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in London on Monday. Murray has already announced that he will retire during 2019 and has stated that he would like to finish after this year’s Wimbledon tournament but made an early exit from the Australian Open in round one after defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut amid fears that the game could be his last. “I now have a metal hip,” Murray said in his social media post following his operation. “Feeling a bit battered and bruised just now but hopefully that will be the end of my hip pain.” Having the surgery means he might not be fit to take part at Wimbledon this summer. In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer. It is the second round of surgery on the troublesome joint, 12 months after the first one, which did not solve the issue. Murray made a long-awaited comeback at Queen’s last summer but pulled out of Wimbledon and struggled to play matches. It was hoped an extensive rehabilitation period in Philadelphia, followed by a gruelling pre-season stint in Miami might prove the answer, but Murray was still in significant pain on the court. Murray will now undergo more rehabilitation to see if he can play again.
