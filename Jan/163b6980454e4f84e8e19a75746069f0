The participants of Guardian Weekend’s most recent Blind Date column, Joanne and Morgan, got more than they bargained for after a highly successful evening out propelled the pair into the public eye. Describing how they bonded over pasta and negronis at an east London restaurant before gatecrashing the “fateful house party”, Joanne said the evening’s awkward moment came for her when she had to flee the party “leaving my knickers behind”. The date, during which the pair both texted friends to say how brilliant the other was, became an internet hit, with readers tweeting in celebration. The former government minister Ed Balls tweeted: “I always love this column – especially ‘Marks out of 10’ – but this one is the BEST ONE EVER !!” The comedian Nish Kumar wrote: “Surely someone has to buy the film rights to this column … They’re the best.” Joanne said on Sunday that the pair had met since, and would continue to see each other. “We will see each other more, of course we will,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. However, when asked whether it would lead to a blind date wedding, she said: “I don’t believe in marriage as a construct … [but] after I’ve finished my pottery course we’re going to be in a full-time relationship.” Joanne and Morgan's @guardian blind date was called 'the best date ever' by lots of you. ❤️🙌But what happened next?
