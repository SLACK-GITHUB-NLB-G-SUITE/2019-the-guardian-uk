Q: I am interested in the way people can become morally corrupted in group scenarios. Which books best show how and why this happens?Calum Michael, 22, engineering student, Glasgow A: Lisa Appignanesi, author, visiting professor in literature at King’s College London and chair of the Royal Society of Literature: There are some gripping novels about how groups, even idealistic ones, coalesce, move through power struggles and then degenerate, engaging in moral and sometimes murderous excesses. In George Orwell’s magnificent parable about Stalinism, Animal Farm, the disparate animals come together as a group around the naming of a common enemy – man. But when their leaders – pigs who champion rebellion – fall out, they provide a new, scapegoated enemy. Scapegoats are an inevitable feature of group life. They become the instrument of togetherness. In William Golding’s allegorical Lord of the Flies a group of young boys stranded on an island descends into leadership battles and ultimate depravity. Margaret Atwood’s Cat’s Eye provides a more realist optic, brilliantly illuminating how her heroine, something of an outsider, is victimised by a group of girls and its seductive leader, a best friend who is adept at power plays and attracts by her cruelty. The famous psychoanalyst DW Winnicott, who worked with the young and wrote a great deal about adolescence, a time of emotional excess and lability (eg Deprivation and Delinquency), talks of the group as a way of providing the identifications, and the needs for defiance and dependence, that seem essential to that time of life. And Sigmund Freud’s Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921) still provides some of the most interesting formulations as to why groups are needed, and go wrong – and how leaders, with whom we identify in various ways, work on our emotions.
