Police are trying to trace a group of men, whom they believe to be Chelsea fans, in connection with alleged sexual assaults and racist chanting on a train. The incidents are alleged to have taken place on 22 December, after Chelsea’s home defeat by Leicester, on a train travelling from London to Worcester. British Transport Police said in a statement: “A group of around 20 football fans boarded the 6.22pm Great Western Service from London Paddington and began to chant racially abusive comments in front of families and children. “They were also seen to sexually assault a number of women on board the train. It is believed they were Chelsea fans. The group, who were all men, left the train at Worcester. “Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed what happened to get in touch so they can assist the investigation. In particular, they believe a number of women who were sexually assaulted are yet to come forward and they would like to encourage them to do so.” In December Chelsea vowed not to rest “until we have eliminated all forms of discrimination from our club” after incidents including fans singing an antisemitic chant at a Europa League match and alleged racist abuse of Raheem Sterling by supporters. Three Chelsea supporters were spoken to by police after officers received reports of antisemitic chanting on a train carrying fans after the club’s game at Brighton in December. Eden Hazard and Maurizio Sarri have urged Chelsea fans not to step out of line at Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final 1st leg against Tottenham at Wembley.
