Prince Philip has apologised to a woman who broke her wrist after being involved in a car crash with his Land Rover Freelander. Emma Fairweather, 46, was a passenger in a friend’s Kia, with her friend’s nine-month-old baby, when the collision with the Duke of Edinburgh’s Land Rover occurred as he pulled out on to the A149 near Sandringham, the Queen’s Norfolk estate, 10 days ago. Both the baby and her friend were unhurt. In his letter to Fairweather, published by the Sunday Mirror and dated 21 January, the duke said he was “very sorry” for his part in the accident, and wished Fairweather “a speedy recovery from a very distressing experience”. Last week Fairweather told the newspaper that she felt “ignored and rejected” because she had not received an apology, but told the paper on Sunday that she was “chuffed” that he had finally responded. “I thought it was really nice that he signed off as ‘Philip’ and not the formal title. I was pleasantly surprised because of the personalised nature. “A lot of people said it was unrealistic that I wanted that human kindness from Prince Philip – which is what I saw this letter as.” In his letter, the duke went into some detail about the circumstances leading up to the accident, blaming the fact that “the sun was shining low over the main road” for not being able to see the Kia coming as he pulled out at the crossroads. “I was somewhat shaken after the accident,” he continued, “but I was greatly relieved that none of you were seriously injured. As a crowd was beginning to gather, I was advised to return to Sandringham House by a local police officer. I have since learned that you suffered a broken arm. I am deeply sorry about this injury.” Two days after the case, the duke was pictured driving a new Land Rover without a seatbelt and was spoken to by the police.
