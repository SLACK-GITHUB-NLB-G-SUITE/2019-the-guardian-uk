As part of our reporting on Brexit we would like to talk to British people who, in the light of the result of the referendum or status of negotiations since, have applied or are applying for citizenship of other EU countries in order to become dual nationals in order to keep their EU citizenship. These could be Britons living in the UK who have applied to specific EU countries on the grounds of birth, marriage, parents’ or grandparents’ heritage, or any other claimed citizenship qualification; Britons living in the EU who are applying to their country of residence for citizenship of that country; or people who are seeking an EU passport by any other means, perhaps by investing in another EU country.
