Staycation or long-haul trip? Campsite or villa with pool? A week at the beach or a month in the country? Whichever kind of holiday you take this summer, one of the best things about it is bound to be having time to read. But how to decide which books to pack? This summer help is at hand from the New Review Summer Book Clinic. Send us your questions for an extended, holiday-themed version of our regular weekly Book Clinic, where experts, authors and critics will offer their tips. As always with Book Clinic, the reading lists we’ll come up with won’t just feature current books. For instance, if you want to match your reading list to your destination, we will be able to mention cultural histories and novels in translation. And if you intend to read a classic that you’ve always put off, our experts will advise which will work best by the pool and which won’t. Whether you are looking for relaxing beach reads or something to inspire, we will prescribe just the thing. Summer Book Clinic will run on Sunday 14 July. Please submit your questions below by Monday 17 June or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
