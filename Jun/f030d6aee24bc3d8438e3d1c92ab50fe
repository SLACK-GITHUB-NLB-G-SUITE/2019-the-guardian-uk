Jack Clarke is on the verge of becoming Tottenham’s first signing of the summer in a deal from Leeds that could be worth £11.5m if all the add-ons are met. Spurs are ready to pay an initial fee of around £10m and the 18-year-old winger will undergo his medical on Wednesday. Clarke has just completed his breakthrough season, quickening the pulse on his first Championship start against Derby in January before his form tailed off after he collapsed in the dugout while watching the second half at Middlesbrough in February. Mauricio Pochettino is convinced that Clarke has what it takes to step up in the Premier League under his guidance, having seen enough over 22 Championship appearances – only four of which were from the start. Pochettino is looking to reinvigorate his squad by signing hungry, young players with the potential to improve and the move for Clarke is independent of the push for another teenage winger – Ryan Sessegnon of Fulham, who is rated in the £25m bracket. Spurs have an interest in Sessegnon’s twin brother, Steven, a right-back who is also at Fulham, and the 19-year-old Norwich player Max Aarons is another target in that position. Much will depend on whether Pochettino sells his first-choice right-back, Kieran Trippier, who is of interest to Napoli among others. Spurs have made a club-record bid of £55m for the Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombele and they are confident of getting the deal over the line, which would be a major coup. With funds tight owing to the cost of the stadium project, they could balance the books by selling Christian Eriksen. The playmaker has said that he wants a new challenge at another club.
