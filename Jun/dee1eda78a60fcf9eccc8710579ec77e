I have been in a loveless relationship for seven years. I feel like such an idiot for allowing this to go on for so long. He won’t go to couples therapy. I’m done asking. I want to leave. I want to experience unconditional love, affection, sex, kissing, touching – everything that comes with being in a relationship. I’m 28 and we have a daughter. I feel trapped in my own life. How can I raise a happy, healthy person when I am miserable? If I were financially stable, I would leave with her. How long do I do this for? Should I wait until my daughter is 18?
