Johanna Konta has failed to get through to the Eastbourne International quarter-finals after being knocked in straight sets by the world No 62, Ons Jabeur. The British No 1 was beaten 6-3, 6-2 and will now head to Wimbledon with only four grass court matches under her belt after also losing in the last 16 at Birmingham. Konta, the 14th seed, appeared to be playing well in Eastbourne but could not come up with any answers to Jabeur, who was in impressive form. The Tunisan was 3-2 and a break down in the first set, before a remarkable comeback led to her dominating for the rest of the match. She will play in the quarter-finals in her Eastbourne debut and leaves Konta to contemplate Wimbledon, her next tournament. “I like the way I played,” said Jabeur. “I like to make crazy shots. Konta is a great player and has inspired me in the past. I hope the crowd can come with me now.” Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels
