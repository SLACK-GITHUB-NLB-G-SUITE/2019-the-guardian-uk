The worst idea was having fixed terms for parliament (Brexit and Britain’s broken democracy, Letters, 19 June). The electorate can now go to sleep for five years, whereas everyone should be thinking politically more often. The Chartists had the best idea.

We could have the system that formerly existed in local government, with one-third of members coming up for election each year.Violet PoleBridgend, Wales • In her review of the book about the Olivier sisters (Review, 15 June), Elizabeth Lowry spoke of “the bucolic idealism underpinning the Fabian worldview”.

It has little or nothing to do with bucolic idealism.Michael CunninghamWolverhampton • So baby boomers are laying out more on recreation, restaurants, hotels and culture, are we (Report, 20 June)?
