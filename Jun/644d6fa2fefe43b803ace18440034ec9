The writer of the acclaimed HBO drama series Chernobyl has spoken out about the proliferation of lewd and inappropriate selfies taken by tourists visiting the nuclear disaster site in Ukraine. Since the five-part miniseries about the 1986 catastrophe at the former Soviet Union power plant began airing in May, tourism at the site has reportedly increased by 30–40%. Social media influencers visiting the site have been subject to criticism in recent days for using renewed interest in the disaster to stage glamour shots for their Instagram accounts. Posts from the plant on social media include one showing a woman with a hazmat suit undone to reveal a G-string. “It’s wonderful that #ChernobylHBO has inspired a wave of tourism to the Zone of Exclusion,” screenwriter Craig Mazin tweeted on Wednesday morning. “But yes, I’ve seen the photos going around. “If you visit, please remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there. Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacrificed.” Babushkas of Chernobyl 👵🏼 A few days ago I had the pleasure to meet these gorgeous old ladies again ☺️ They are so called ‚self settlers‘, people who refused to leave their homes or returned the year following the nuclear disaster. Nowadays there are about 200 of them living in the exclusion zone. The self settlers are wonderful people, always preparing food for me and offering home made vodka 🙈 you can feel the traditional way of life there. But life for them is incredibly hard. There is no water from the tap, the nearest hospital is very far away and the ‚supermarket bus‘ only comes twice a month.. everything we might take for granted is unimaginable for them. But why did they decide to live in a contaminated area? Radiation is invisible. You can’t see, smell or taste it. The women living in the exclusion zone are unaware of the risks, they just can’t imagine an ‚invisible enemy‘. So they stayed or returned to their homes. The ladies I visited are healthy and they wouldn’t want to live elsewhere than their motherland. This is their home and this is where they want to stay for the rest of their lives ❤️🙏🏼 #chernobyl #exclusionzone #selfsettlers #nucleardisaster A post shared by  JULIA BAESSLER (@juliabaessler) on Jun 2, 2019 at 2:09am PDT The HBO series, starring Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård and Emily Watson and directed by Johan Renck, follows the immediate aftermath of the nuclear reactor explosion at the power plant in the town of Pripyat, and the political repercussions of the disturbing and horrendous toll it took on the people, animals and environment in the region. The series has been lauded as “masterful television” that avoids glamorising the disaster. Two people died at the scene of the explosion and another 28 from acute radiation poisoning over the following weeks, while about 1,000 firefighters and emergency services workers experienced high radiation doses during that time, according to the World Health Organisation. The estimated 116,000 people who lived in the town of Pripyat and within a 30km radius of the site were evacuated in the weeks following, though the effects of radiation exposure for the broader population of Ukraine and Europe is still an ongoing concern. The disaster site has been open to tourists since the late 1990s, but has increased in popularity over the last five to 10 years, particularly the ghost town of Pripyat and the surrounding woods. Visitors are screened for radiation levels on entry and exit, and sometimes wear hazmat suits and carry devices to measure radiation levels. The exclusion zone has also become an important refuge for wildlife.
