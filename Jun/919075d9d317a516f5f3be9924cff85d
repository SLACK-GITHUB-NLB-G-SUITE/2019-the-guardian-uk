Spain and China played out a goalless draw in their Women’s World Cup match in Le Havre – meaning that both sides secured progression into the last 16 as a result. With a point enough to qualify both nations out of Group B alongside the leaders Germany, it was Spain who had the better of the chances as the game ended 0-0. With a share of the spoils Jorge Vilda’s Spain finished as runners-up and China progressed as one of the four third-placed sides with the best record. Spain dominated possession and crafted enough opportunities to win the game, but were kept out by a defiant Chinese defensive effort. Lucía Garcia came close with an early strike wide of the post before a rare mistake in the China back division allowed Jenni Hermoso to get in a free header that was cleared off the line. Nahikari García also passed up a decent chance after being slipped through, but it was in the closing stages that Spain nearly scored a winner. The China goalkeeper Peng Shimeng, who had almost cost her side a goal earlier in the contest after steaming off her line, made a great save to deny Patri Guijarro with just six minutes left on the clock. With Germany topping the group following three wins out of three, Spain advance in second place and will meet the USA or Sweden next Monday in Reims.
