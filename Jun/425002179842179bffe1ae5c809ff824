Death tolls can be hard to calculate. Violence, whether it’s natural or manmade, can create chaos that makes counting difficult. And we rarely pay attention for long enough to see that those who die from their injuries are added to the final count of the dead. And sometimes, there’s a vested interest in minimizing the numbers. On 3 June, government forces in Sudan violently attacked protesters in Khartoum. The protesters were calling for the transitional military council to hand power over to a civilian-led government. According to Human Rights Watch, protesters were chased, whipped, shot at and, according to several reports, raped. Initial reports put the death toll at 30. But, as the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors continued to investigate, the figure continued to rise to 60. By 6 June, they believed that 108 people had been killed (including 40 people whose bodies had been pulled from the Nile, footage showed that their limbs had been weighed down with cement bricks to keep their bodies below water). As of 12 June, the committee estimate the death toll at 118 people. But state sources disagree. Initially, the state news agency claimed that just 46 people had died. Later, the director general of the health ministry put the figure at 61. They have not updated these numbers in response to the bodies which have been counted by the Sudanese doctors committee.
