Students at Victorian public schools will be banned from using their phones from next year. In an effort to reduce distractions and cyber bullying, and hopefully improve education outcomes, students will have to switch off their phones and store them in lockers during school hours until the final bell, Education Minister James Merlino has announced. In the case of an emergency, parents or guardians can reach their child by calling the school. The only exceptions to the ban will be where students use phones to monitor health conditions, or where teachers instruct students to bring their phone for a particular classroom activity. The ban will start from term one in 2020. It comes after McKinnon Secondary College banned phones from its grounds and reported students as being more focused during class and communicating more in the school yard. New South Wales banned mobile phones in all state primary schools at the end of last year.
