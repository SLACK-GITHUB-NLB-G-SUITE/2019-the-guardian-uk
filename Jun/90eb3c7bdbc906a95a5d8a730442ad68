Bridget Christie. “I have rape fantasies all the time; my main one – longer sentencing!” is such a brilliant line. Broad City. I also love Warwick Davis hosting ITV gameshow Tenable, because he comes out with many Accidental Partridge moments. Each round a teammate can get eliminated into “the vortex” and Warwick takes a lot of pleasure in quipping: “Whoops-a-daisy, you’ve lost your wife!” The only heckling I’ve ever had is from repressed lads bellowing “Sideshow Bob” at me on a directionally opposing tube escalator. And one time I performed with David Icke and he called me “a massive nuisance”. I have a Cliff Richard T-shirt that was £1 from Deptford market. The week after I bought it, the news was like: “He’s dodgy!!!” so I stopped wearing it. Then he got cleared of being dodgy so now it’s my pyjama top. The Strictly curse! I mean: come on, straight people! It’s amazing what some sequins and a Latin American movement pattern can do to wreck a home. I once had a Brazilian straightening treatment on my hair. Six hours later I looked like Rachel from Friends circa 1998. Jack Rooke plays Assembly George Square Gardens, Edinburgh, 1 to 24 August
