The former Barclays chief executive John Varley has been acquitted in a criminal trial over a deal with Qatar at the time of the financial crisis. A decision handed down by the court of appeal on Friday upheld a ruling by a lower court to drop charges against Varley, who was accused of disguising payments made to Qatar. The appeal court upheld the ruling that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. It also ruled that the remaining defendants, all former senior executives at Barclays, will return to trial at a date to be determined. They are Roger Jenkins, a former investment banking chief; Thomas Kalaris, a former head of the wealth division; and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions at the bank. Lord Justice Gross, sitting at the appeal court, said: “Following an application by Mr Varley at the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge ruled that the evidence against him on each count was insufficient for the case to proceed. The appeal was dismissed by the court of appeal … Accordingly, Mr Varley has been acquitted on both counts.”
