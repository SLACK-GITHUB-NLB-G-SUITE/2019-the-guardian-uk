Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’ve just inherited my dad’s vinyl collection and am desperate to listen to the records but don’t have anything to play them on. I’d like an old-school turntable, amp and speakers for less than £250 – either new or used. What should I be looking at? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
