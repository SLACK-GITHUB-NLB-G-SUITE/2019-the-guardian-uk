Sean Ingle is right to highlight the absence of free-to-view ball-by-ball coverage of the World Cup and its potentially negative impact on attracting future generations of fans – and players (Pitch Perfect? England bat for glory and new generation of fans, 30 May). It is also highly likely that the final stages of the 10-team competition will follow the money – the odds being stacked in favour of Australia, England and India, who control and receive the major share of funding from the International Cricket Council – reinforcing divisions between richer and poorer nations. This funding inequity gives the context for Jofra Archer, from Barbados, sacrificing his West Indian identity to play for England, and for other cricketers to stop playing Test cricket altogether for the individual rewards in English county cricket.Mike SteinPudsey, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
