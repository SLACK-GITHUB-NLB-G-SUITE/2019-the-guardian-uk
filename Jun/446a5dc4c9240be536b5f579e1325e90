Mick Jagger appeared healthy and energetic as he returned to the stage for his first major concert performance following heart surgery. Jagger, 75, ran and skipped along a narrow stage that jutted out into the crowd as the Rolling Stones launched their North American tour at Soldier Field in Chicago. It was his first major concert performance since doctors told him three months ago he required medical treatment and needed to postpone the tour. Jagger reportedly underwent a heart valve replacement procedure in New York. The band, formed more than 50 years ago, opened with Street Fighting Man followed by Let’s Spend the Night Together. “It’s great to be back at Soldier Field – for the eighth time,” Jagger said, before launching into the third song, Tumbling Dice. The No Filter Tour was slated to start on 20 April in Miami before doctors told Jagger in late March he required treatment, reportedly for a heart valve issue. Jagger tweeted at the time: “I’m devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.” A representative for Jagger said in April he successfully underwent treatment and that he was expected to make a full recovery. All the cities on the tour that were previously postponed are locked in, and there is a new date in New Orleans. A second show at Soldier Field, the home stadium of the Chicago Bears NFL team, is scheduled for Tuesday. Tickets sold for the original dates are being honoured, but those who could not attend were able to get refunds by accessing their Ticketmaster accounts.
