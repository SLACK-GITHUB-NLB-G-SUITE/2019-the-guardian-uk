The Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg wants to start a family with his husband, Chasten, and says that could happen if he makes it to the White House. “I don’t see why not,” the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said in a Father’s Day television interview that also marked his first wedding anniversary. Buttigieg was little known nationally before he began his campaign for president earlier this year, but has seen his star rise in recent months, ranking alongside Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in one Iowa poll last week. "I don't see why not. I think it wouldn't be the first time children have arrived to a first couple."Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg tells @JakeTapper he and his husband, Chasten, may be open to having kids in the White House, if he is elected. #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/e7J5eJhsY7 He would be America’s youngest and first openly gay president if he were to take the White House in the November 2020 election. He would also be the first openly gay presidential nominee from a major political party. Buttigieg told CNN’s State of the Union that “it wouldn’t be the first time that children have arrived to a first couple, but obviously that’s a conversation I had better have with Chasten before I go into it too much on television.” Chasten Buttigieg has become a celebrity in his own right, and is often greeted with applause when he appears on the campaign trail.
