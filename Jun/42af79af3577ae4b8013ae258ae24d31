Looking back, 2017 was a golden year for melodious hooks in UK rap music – and most of that was down to MoStack. The Hornsey rapper is at the forefront of a London scene blurring the lines between Afro-pop, hip-hop, grime, and dancehall, and in 2017 alone defined the sound by appearing on ubiquitous singles such as Fisherman with J Hus, Screw & Brew with Mist, and No Words with south Londoner Dave. On his debut album, Stacko, it’s MoStack’s turn to take the spotlight. True to form, the record is brimming with imaginative, liquid melodies, drizzled over playful Afrobeats and – on the nostalgic I Want You – UK garage. An early standout is the ostentatious Stinking Rich, featuring Dave and J Hus, with a hook that’s primed for being yelled by festival crowds; following that, there’s the flirty, finger-snapping Respect & Love. On the Stormzy-featuring Shine Girl, MoStack pays tribute to his girlfriend over a glimmering, shuffling production, landing just the right side of sickly sweet. Over the course of 13 tracks, MoStack feels not quite as well-suited to the album format as the peers who appear as his guests – Mo’s debut lacks the intricate storytelling of Dave’s, or the conceptual ambition of Stormzy’s. His lyrics return frequently to the same well of themes, in particular, success and loyalty. But his sun-soaked party songs still make for a joyful experience; you’re likely to hear this album pouring out of cars on hot city streets all summer long.
