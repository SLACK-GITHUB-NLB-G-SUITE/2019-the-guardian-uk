Maurizio Sarri is set to join Juventus on a three-year contract after securing his release from Chelsea. The Italian’s agent, Fali Ramadani, met with the Premier League club on Friday and came to an agreement with the Chelsea hierarchy that means Sarri is free to join Juventus. The Serie A club, champions in Italy for the last eight seasons, are confident they will not have to pay a fee for the 60-year-old, who was a rival to the Turin club when coach of Napoli. Sarri only joined Chelsea last summer after three years at Napoli, replacing compatriot Antonio Conte but despite winning the Europa League and qualifying for next season’s Champions League, last season was an uneasy campaign in west London. Chelsea also reached the Carabao Cup final, but lost that against Manchester City in a game that will be remembered for the farcical scenes that followed the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refusing to be substituted before the penalty shoot-out. The news of Sarri’s departure, although long anticipated, came on the same day that Real Madrid announced the signing of Eden Hazard, Chelsea’s star player, for an initial £88.5m, which could rise to as much as £130m. The club are also facing a two-window transfer ban from Fifa after being found guilty of breaching rules regarding their dealings with overseas players under the age of 18. Chelsea confirmed on Friday they have appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. To replace Sarri, Chelsea will now look to former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri, Nuno Espírito Santo of Wolves, Javi Gracía of Watford, Laurent Blanc, a free agent since being sacked by Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, and former player and all-time leading goalscorer Frank Lampard, who led Derby to the Championship play-offs in his first season in management.
