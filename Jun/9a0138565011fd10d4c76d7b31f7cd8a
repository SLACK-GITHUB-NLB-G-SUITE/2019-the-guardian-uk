German authorities have arrested a Bosnian man wanted in connection with the 2015 Paris attacks and are preparing his extradition to Belgium. The German federal police office and Dresden prosecutors said in a joint statement that the 39-year-old suspect was apprehended on the night of 19 June on a European arrest warrant issued by Belgian authorities. He is accused of “abetting a terrorist organisation linked to the terror attacks, including on the Bataclan concert hall, on 13 November 2015 in Paris”. German authorities said he had been targeted in a separate investigation into two Bosnian citizens suspected to have violated a military weapons control law. They said a continuing investigation led to the whereabouts of the suspect, who was not named. He appeared before a German judge last week on the basis of the warrant and is in custody. The attacks by Islamic State gunmen in Paris on the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France and several cafes killed 130 people.
