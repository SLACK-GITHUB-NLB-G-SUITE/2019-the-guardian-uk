Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our kitchen appears to be in an internet black hole. Our router is situated in the living room, which is about 10 metres from the kitchen. The wifi signal stops at the door of the kitchen, however. I have tried a few wifi extenders but none have worked. How do I get connected while cooking? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
