Quick: without looking, who is the secretary of state for exiting the European Union? I suspect more people would be able to give the more common version of that job title as clued by novelist-cum-setter Picaroon … 6d Politician Brits execrate violently online (6,9)[ wordplay: anagram (“violently”) of BRITSEXECRATE + abbrev. for railway (“online” considered as two words) ][ BREXITSECRETA + RY ][ definition: politician ] … that is, BREXIT SECRETARY, than could name Stephen Barclay (at time of writing). Here’s a pleasingly misleading surface meaning from Dutch: 2d Boris perhaps oddly dour with number in government (7)[ wordplay: first & third letters of (“oddly”) DOUR + abbrev. for “number”, both inside (“in”) abbrev. for “government” ][ DU + N, both inside GOV ][ definition: Boris, perhaps ] … en route to a tsar celebrated in song, Boris GODUNOV. Might the Times setter behind this clue … 22ac He’s after majority, damaging morale etc (9)[ wordplay: anagram of (“damaging”) MORALEETC ][ definition: he’s after majority ] … for LATECOMER have likewise intended to suggest a more recent Boris? And in themed puzzles: no spoilers, but those who enjoy the quirkier end of language will definitely enjoy Raich’s recent Independent on Sunday antics. On the subject of misleading surfaces, here’s Vlad: 11ac ‘Roger Taylor is inside’ (Queen fan) (8)[ wordplay: make an anagram of (“roger”) TAYLOR, containing IS (“is inside”) ][ ROYALT containing IS ][ definition: Queen fan ] This clue for ROYALIST uses one of the slangier senses of Roger, which apparently comes directly from the literal meaning of the name (famous with a spear). Less lewdly, Roger is a policeman, a simpleton and a chatty way of saying “OK”. The last is of course from the decidedly less chatty context of radiotelephony, where it means “I have received your last transmission satisfactorily,” “Roger” denoting the R of “received”. Solvers who enjoyed our guide to the phonetic alphabet will be thinking: isn’t R “Romeo”? Well, it is, but it was Roger before that, and here’s the Nato edict tacitly acknowledging that it would have been madness to try and switch such a commonly understood procedure word. And here’s the Combined Communications-Electronics Board definition of a related word … I have received your message, I understand it and I will comply with it (only used by the addressee). Since the meaning of ROGER is included in that of WILCO the two prowords are not used together … which should perhaps end “should not be used together”, since informally they so often are. Reader, how would you clue WILCO? Many thanks for your clues for SQUIFFY. The audacity award of course goes to Wellywearer2 for… There’s really no need to be sniffyThough this clue is decidedly iffyYou need to have thunk’Bout a word that means drunkOr tipsy or kaylied or _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (7) … though Tomrollock is audacious in a different way with “Johnson, standing indecorously to take question for time’s tight”, which reminds us that we got the word from prime-ministerial nicknames, as does Lizard’s “There’s question against bit of satire – dodgy and awry”. The runners-up are Schroduck’s “After half of fruit cordial, get sick – but not this?” and PeterMooreFuller’s “Ridiculous quiff you’re keeping well-oiled”; the winner is Peshwari’s “Strange – after squad’s cut by half, it’s half-cut”. Kludos to Peshwari; please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics below. The annotated solution is now available for Philistine’s prize puzzle. I suspect that most solvers will have needed some crossing letters as well as this clue … 16d Primarily hooked on gin, his work included (7)[ wordplay: first letters of (“primarily”) HOOKED ON GIN HIS, containing (included) synonym for “work” ][ HOGH containing ART ][ definition: same as the wordplay! ] … for HOGARTH, but so it goes for deft all-in-one phrases like this.
