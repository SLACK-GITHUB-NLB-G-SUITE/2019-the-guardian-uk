I have a theory that people often have similar careers to others who are born on, or close to, the same day. A fairly high proportion of those born in winter are often politicians, lawyers, scientists or businesspeople, whereas a summer birthday tends towards the performing arts. Of the 34 people in your birthdays column (Journal, 29 May) nine were musicians and eight involved in dance or drama. Patricia PipeSaltash, Cornwall • Mike Smith (Letters, 31 May) should take a trip to London. The new Routemaster buses have offered a free hop-on hop-off service since their arrival in 2012. A goodly number of passengers enter through the middle and rear doors and don’t swipe their Oyster cards. My local number 73 has been christened the Seventy Free.Tom UprichardLondon • Regarding the purpose and value of university (Letters, 1 June), when I was at school in the late 1960s my French teacher told us that girls only went to university to find a husband. As it happened, I met my husband of 43 years at university (as did many of my contemporaries), but I surely gained more than a change of name and a ring on my finger.Maggi NewtonCheadle, Cheshire • I was surprised the top 10 Bruce Springsteen albums did not include We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (G2, 31 May). It features exhilarating versions of traditional songs associated with Pete Seeger, but the highlight is Springsteen’s idiosyncratic interpretation of the ancient Scottish folk song Froggie Went a Courtin’. Bruce was born to croak.Mike PenderCardiff • No The Ghost of Tom Joad in Bruce Springsteen’s top 10 albums?
