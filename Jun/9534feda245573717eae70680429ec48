Lizzie Deignan moved into the overall race lead at the Women’s Tour with one day remaining after winning stage five in Builth Wells. The Briton proved too strong in a sprint for Kasia Niewiadoma, the winner of stage four, with Trek-Segafredo teammate Elisa Longo Borghini coming home third. The trio escaped on the day’s final serious climb, but it was Deignan who took the win. She now heads Niewiadoma by a single second in the overall classification. The race concludes on Saturday with a 126-kilometre run to Pembrey Country Park from Carmarthen.
