Kieran Shoemark says he hopes to be riding at Royal Ascot in a fortnight, having enjoyed a winner from his first ride after a six-month suspension at Lingfield on Saturday night. The 23-year-old jockey, who has spoken with disarming frankness about his struggles with addiction that led to a positive test for cocaine, added that he was particularly grateful to his weighing room colleagues for the warmth of the welcome he received when returning to work at the weekend, and even more so to the trainer Charlie Hills, who has been extremely supportive as the rider works hard to leave his old habits behind. “It was amazing,” Shoemark said in reference to his win aboard Heroic. He had made the two-hour journey from Lambourn to Lingfield for the one ride and it proved to be entirely worth it when Heroic held off the odds-on favourite by a neck. “I suppose it’s only natural to get a bit nervous beforehand. There was a lot of relief but I was absolutely buzzing at the same time.” When a jockey makes a winning comeback, punters tend to suspect it is the result of a long and cunning plan, but Shoemark says he had expected to be making his return at Doncaster on Saturday. “I was only swapped over to go to Lingfield at the last minute. Someone was looking down on me. “It feels really normal again. When I went racing again at Nottingham the next day, it was like I hadn’t ever been away. Everyone’s been great, coming up and shaking my hand. I’ve had a lot of support.” Shoemark is now fully back in the old routine, riding at Wolverhampton on Monday and Lingfield on Tuesday night. Wednesday will take him to Kempton, Thursday requires a journey up to Ripon. “Charlie’s been fantastic. He’s putting me on the majority of his runners just now. Things are going really well. I’ll keep looking for the next winner.” Hills’s two stable stars, the sprinter Battaash and the Classic winner Phoenix Of Spain, have established links with other jockeys but Shoemark hopes to be aboard other runners for the stable when Royal Ascot comes around. “Charlie always seems to have a lot of runners going to Ascot each year, always a few in the handicaps. I’m sure I’ll be there but I wouldn’t know what horses yet.” Regular AA meetings are, the jockey says, part of his life now and he finds he is able to fit them into his routine, along with riding out and travelling to the races. “I’m taking everything day by day and enjoying it.” Wednesday’s full tipping preview will appear here on Wednesday morning Nottingham 12.00 With Virtue 12.30 Dr Doro 1.00 Copal 1.30 Baltic Baron 2.00 Red Seeker 2.35 Moon King (nap) 3.10 Sandkissed 3.45 Miracle Garden Newton Abbot 1.50 Lough Derg Rose 2.25 Pingshou 3.00 Panko 3.35 Thebannerkingrebel 4.10 Eric The Third 4.40 Cosmic King 5.10 Ali The Hunter Fontwell 2.15 Top Rock Talula 2.50 De Plotting Shed 3.25 The Butcher Said 4.00 Regulation 4.30 Urtheonethatiwant 5.00 Nativegetaway 5.30 Twasn't The Plan Kempton 5.15 Divine Queen 5.45 Dark Side Dream 6.15 Laurier 6.45 Penrhos 7.15 Mawakib 7.45 Big Kitten 8.15 Superb Story (nb) 8.45 Kitcarina RIpon 6.30 Spartan Fighter 7.00 Cardano 7.30 Constant 8.00 Polybius 8.30 Always Resolute 9.00 Alright Sunshine
