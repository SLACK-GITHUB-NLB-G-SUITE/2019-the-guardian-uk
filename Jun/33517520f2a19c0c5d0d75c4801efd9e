Germany sealed top spot in Group B as they eased past South Africa with a 4-0 Women’s World Cup victory in Montpellier on Monday. Following 1-0 wins in their opening two matches against China and Spain, the reigning Olympic champions progressed to the last 16 in style while their opponents were sent home after three defeats. Melanie Leupolz put Germany in front after 14 minutes with a free header from close range. Leupolz’s former Bayern Munich teammate Sara Däbritz, who signed for Paris Saint-Germain in May, doubled Germany’s tally on the half-hour as she got on the scoresheet for the second successive game. Germany left South Africa’s slim chances of qualifying in tatters five minutes before the break as the Wolfsburg striker Alexandra Popp headed in a third goal. Lina Magull reacted fastest to slot home from close range just before the hour. Germany’s next game will be in Grenoble on Saturday. They will play one of the third-placed sides.
