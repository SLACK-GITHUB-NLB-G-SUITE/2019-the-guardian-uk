Uganda won at the Africa Cup of Nations finals for the first time in more than 40 years as they upset the Democratic Republic of Congo 2-0 in their opening Group A match at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday. Both goals came from set pieces as Patrick Kaddu headed home a 14th-minute corner and then Emmanuel Okwi got a touch onto a free kick just after half-time. Uganda last won at the finals in 1978 when they beat Nigeria in the semi-finals and finished runners-up to hosts Ghana. Saturday’s surprise win served notice of the potential of a team not given much chance of progressing past the first round. Nigeria needed a late goal from substitute Odion Ighalo to claim a 1-0 win over a brave Burundi side playing their first match at the Africa Cup of Nations. Ighalo, set free by Ola Aina’s clever flicked pass, side-footed the ball past Burundi goalkeeper Jonathan Nahimana in the 77th minute, four minutes after coming on in the opening Group B match. It was tough on Burundi who refused to be overawed and enjoyed slightly the better of the first half, with Frederic Nsabiyumva heading against the crossbar from a set piece. Madagascar marked their Africa Cup of Nations debut with a draw against Group B opponents Guinea in Alexandria. Sory Kaba put Guinea ahead after 34 minutes but goals from Anicet Andrianantenaina and Charles Carolus Andriamatsinoro in six second-half minutes put Madagascar ahead. Francois Kamano’s 66th-minute penalty earned a point for Guinea, after Romain Métanire had fouled Ibrahima Traoré.
