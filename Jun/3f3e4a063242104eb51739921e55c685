An early header from Linda Sembrant helped Sweden towards a 5-1 victory over Thailand that guarantees their progress into the knockout stages of the Women’s World Cup. The defender rose bravely to meet a free-kick and give her side the lead in the sixth minute before Kosovare Asllani jinked in from the byline to add a second 13 minutes later. Fridolina Rolfö struck a third just before half-time with a spectacular drive from long range. A largely uneventful second half ended in a flurry of action when Lina Hurtig headed home a fourth 10 minutes from time. Thailand’s Kanjana Sung-Ngoen then raced clear to hammer home a stoppage-time consolation goal before Sweden were awarded a penalty for handball, expertly converted by Elin Rubensson with the final kick of the game.
