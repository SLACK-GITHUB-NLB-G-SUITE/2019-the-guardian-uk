I, too, have issues with the mail order gardening firm Thompson & Morgan (you ran an item in April). I ordered a fruit tree in January and received it without the instructions. I emailed and got a copy of the online info (which I already had), then, after further emails, got a reply. By April, there was no growth and by early May only a shoot on the graft. I called twice and was kept waiting an hour, then cut off. No one called back. I thought it might be due to the RHS shows, so I waited until they were over and tried again. I was offered a replacement by the end of the week. I was then told it was not in stock and that I had been refunded – I cannot see a refund. I asked to speak to a manager, but was told it was not possible. This is completely unacceptable – with no apparent intention of resolution. Caveat emptor loud and clear.JD, Stowmarket, Suffolk Thompson & Morgan’s commercial director, Chris Wright, blamed (as last time) an upgrade to its computer system which led to “a number of teething problems”. He said extra staff had been recruited and worked 24/7 to resolve the difficulties, although looking at Trustpilot the negative reviews are still rolling in. Wright reassured us it had taken steps to resolve your complaint adding: “I would like to point out that 95% of our customers would not have experienced any issues or delays.” Of course, that leaves a very unhappy 5%. If in doubt, we advise you to stick to your local nursery. There’s an irony in your case as you live in Stowmarket and T&M is based in Ipswich – er, 13 miles away.
