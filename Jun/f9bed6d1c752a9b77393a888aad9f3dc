Police have said a man attempting to get through a staff search area at Gatwick carrying two kitchen knives has been shot with a stun gun. The 30-year-old, from Crawley, West Sussex, was arrested on suspicion of possessing offensive weapons and making threats to kill after “openly carrying a kitchen knife in each hand”. The incident, which was not being treated as terrorism-related, occurred at the airport’s south terminal at 1.55am on Monday. The man, who was not a travelling passenger, was in police custody after being challenged by officers who used an electrical weapon to detain him. Supt Justin Burtenshaw of Sussex police said: “Officers at Gatwick are there to keep passengers and staff safe. This incident was dealt with swiftly and no members of the public or police were harmed.”
