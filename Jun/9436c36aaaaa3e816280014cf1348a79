I would remind Polly Toynbee (Labour is on the brink in Peterborough. This byelection is a battle over its future, theguardian.com, 6 June) of the tremendous diversity of the union I lead, and that it is those members that I speak for. I don’t need to make awayday trips to the “north” to find out what working people are thinking, why so many voted leave in 2016 and why, whatever their views on Brexit, they are cautious about a second referendum. The result of the Peterborough byelection vindicates Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on Brexit, seeking to unite the country, leave or remain, so that we can get on with the urgent job of fixing the ills dividing us. I would urge Ms Toynbee to reflect on the fact that every time she writes, she alienates more ordinary people from the remain cause she champions.Len McCluskeyGeneral secretary, Unite the union • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
