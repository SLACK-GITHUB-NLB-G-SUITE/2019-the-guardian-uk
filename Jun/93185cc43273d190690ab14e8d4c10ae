Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. 5G has been launched in the UK this week. I love the idea of higher connection speeds and I live in one of the areas where the new network operates. It is not cheap, however. So should I sign up now and buy a 5G phone or should I wait until there are more options on the market? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
