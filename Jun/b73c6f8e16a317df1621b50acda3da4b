Jolien D’Hoore won the opening stage of the OVO Energy Women’s Tour for the second year running. The 29-year-old Belgian, riding for Boels-Dolmans, triumphed over the 157km route from Beccles to Stowmarket in Suffolk. Abby-Mae Parkinson broke away from the pack with 22km remaining and opened up a gap of more than a minute and a half. The 21-year-old was reeled in over the closing kilometres and D’Hoore won the finishing sprint to take the green jersey. D’Hoore’s teammate Amy Pieters, of the Netherlands, was second and Germany’s Lisa Brennauer (WNT-Rotor) third. Chris Froome and Adam Yates moved into the top 10 of the Critérium du Dauphiné general classification after a hilly second stage. Dylan Teuns took the yellow jersey and victory on the 180km stage from Mauriac to Craponne-sur-Arzon after overhauling Guillaume Martin in a two-rider sprint finish. Jakob Fuglsang took the bonus seconds for finishing third as he beat a group of fellow GC favourites to the line. Froome and last year’s Dauphiné runner-up Yates were both in that group and are 24 seconds down on Teuns in the GC standings. Froome had earlier recovered from a puncture to rejoin the peloton as they chased a breakaway group, who included the 2017 Giro d’Italia winner, Tom Dumoulin. The stage one winner, Edvald Boasson Hagen, had his hold on the yellow jersey broken when he finished almost two minutes down. Teuns takes a 3sec lead over Martin into stage three, with Fuglsang 20sec back and Alexey Lutsenko a further second off the pace in fourth.
