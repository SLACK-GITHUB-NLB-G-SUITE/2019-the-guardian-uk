Richard Carapaz became Ecuador’s first grand tour champion by winning the Giro d’Italia while Chad Haga of the US was fastest in the final stage’s individual time trial. Carapaz, who rides for Movistar, keeled over his handlebars with emotion at the Arena di Verona after the 17km (10.5-mile) test. The 26-year-old has worn the leader’s pink jersey since winning the gruelling 14th stage on 25 May. “This is the biggest moment of my sporting life,” he said. “In this final time trial I just suffered from start to finish until I reached the arena of Verona. It’s fabulous to win the Giro d’Italia.” He finished the three-week race 1min 5sec ahead of the home favourite Vincenzo Nibali and 2.30 in front of the Slovenian Primoz Roglic, who leapfrogged Mikel Landa into third spot. Carapaz and Nibali brought their children on to the podium when they collected their trophies. The winner’s parents had also flown over from Ecuador – the first time they had been on an aeroplane. Haga had told his wife to stay at home in the US. “Maybe that was a mistake,” he said as he smiled through tears of joy. “This is for everyone who believed in me and supported me and sacrificed for me. I gave everything and to finally win … it’s very special.” It was Haga’s first stage victory in a grand tour, moreover. “I started this morning believing strongly I could win. I saved my legs these past few days. Watching Roglic and Nibali on TV, I had to convince myself that they were tired,” he said. He finished four seconds faster than Victor Campenaerts and six ahead of Thomas De Gendt. Britain’s Simon Yates clocked 23min 7sec to hold on to a top-10 place, finishing eighth overall.
