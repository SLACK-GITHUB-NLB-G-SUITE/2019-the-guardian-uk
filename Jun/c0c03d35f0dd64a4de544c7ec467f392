Saturday mornings would not be the same without Feast, but I am becoming increasingly perplexed about your love affair with chillis. Admittedly Saturday’s edition was some sort of chilli special – the first 11 pages had recipes from four trusty regulars which all included chillis in at least one form, sometimes more, including Thomasina Miers’ instruction to start children on mild doses to accustom their palates, before building up to the real thing. Perhaps she should have said “numb” rather than “accustom”, as it seems to me that the ubiquitous chilli is frequently used to mask other flavours or to compensate for their lack. Indeed, chillis are now routinely added to so many savoury foods – from cauliflower cheese to pizza and ratatouille – which are perfectly fine without them. So, in the interests of balance, can I suggest that you publish a chilli-free Feast very soon?Maggie OwenLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
