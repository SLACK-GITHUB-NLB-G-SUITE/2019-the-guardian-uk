Statistically, people are quite kind. The University of Michigan just spent £472,000 proving this by planting 17,303 “lost” wallets in public places in 40 countries around the world and asking strangers to help return them to their owner. If the wallet contained a small amount of money, 51% of people returned it, with the figure rising to 72% if the wallet contained a substantial amount of money. Which is all well and good, but how honest are you? Obviously I don’t trust you with actual money – I’ve read some of your comments – so here’s an entirely hypothetical Choose Your Own Adventure-stye simulation instead. a) Ignore it (RESULT: you do not care about your fellow humans) b) Pick it up (go to 2) a) Money (go to 3) b) Identification (go to 4) a) Assume the owner must rich enough to award a sizeable finder’s fee and seek out identification (go to 4) b) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) a) Return the wallet to Boris Johnson (go to 5) b) Rifle through the wallet for state secrets with which to blackmail him (go to 6) c) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) a) Shrug because you did the right thing all along (RESULT: You are as honest as you could possibly be) b) Grab his bicycle and hurl it into the nearest river (RESULT: You are still technically honest, but also quite spiteful in a generally amusing way) a) Go to the press (go to 8) b) Go to Boris Johnson (go to 9) c) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) a) Return the wallet to Boris Johnson and tell him it was empty when you found it (RESULT: You are essentially dishonest, but your dishonesty is balanced out by a morality that manifests itself in self-hatred) b) Vomit in the wallet and throw it in the bin (RESULT: Dishonest) a) Let them have the story anyway because the truth always outweighs financial gain (go to 10) b) Tell them to bugger off, walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) a) Take the money (RESULT: You are rich but terrible) b) Realise the severity of the matter, change your mind and go to the press (go to 8) There is another leadership competition. Michael Gove wins. RESULT: You did the right thing, but everything ended badly anyway because this is 2019 and everything always ends badly. • Stuart Heritage writes about film, TV and music for the Guardian
