With a trio of lemon, rosemary and olive oil, you might wonder if you’ve stumbled upon a recipe for salad dressing rather than a cake. But this is one of my favourites; it’s deceptively simple but full of texture and flavour, and cries out to be eaten with a scoop of mascarpone and a cup of coffee. Using olive oil instead of butter keeps the cake exceptionally moist with a slight hint of fruity bitterness to cut through the sweet. If you’ve never had a slice of rosemary cake before, then all I can say is that you won’t be disappointed. Not all rosemary is created equal, so make sure you’re using some that actually has flavour, instead of the flavourless twigs I’ve had the misfortune of buying over the years. Have a nibble on a leaf – you should instantly be able to recognise that herby flavour. Serves 10-12Prep 20 minCook 35 min 200g olive oil, plus extra for greasing3 large eggs125g caster sugarZest of 2 lemons, finely chopped to get 3 tbsp150g plain flour90g ground almonds¼ tsp salt For the syrup6 x 10cm sprigs rosemary100g lemon juice100g caster sugar60g water Line the bottom of an 20cm round cake tin with greaseproof paper, and brush the base and sides with a little oil. Put all the cake ingredients in a bowl and mix until you have a thick batter. Pour into the prepared tin and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden brown and risen, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. While the cake is baking, prepare the syrup. Tip all the ingredients into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer gently for another five minutes, then turn off the heat and leave the rosemary to infuse. While the cake and syrup are still warm, make holes all over the top of the cake with a skewer, and pour over the syrup. Leave to cool in the tin (the cake will absorb the syrup as it sits) before turning out and serving.
