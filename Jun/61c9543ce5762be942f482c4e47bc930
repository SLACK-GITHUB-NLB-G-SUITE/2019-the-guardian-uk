Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has announced that he will release his “dystopian” new solo album and an accompanying short film on 27 June. The “one-reeler”, created by Yorke and US filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, will be released on Netflix on the same day the nine-track record comes out. In a teaser trailer, Netflix described the “musical film”, which will be set to three tracks from Yorke’s new album and in which he will star, as “a mind-bending visual piece” that is “best played loud”. Yorke has been sending out teasers about his forthcoming work for weeks, projecting cryptic messages on London landmarks and offering clues in interviews that it would be in part a manifestation of “a sense of anxiety” and society’s current “crisis point”. “I thought a really good way of expressing anxiety creatively was in a dystopian environment,” he told Crack magazine recently. His first solo album since 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes comes after Yorke, 50, scored last year’s remake of the cult horror film Suspiria. In April, he also delved into the contemporary classical realm, launching two new compositions at the Philharmonie de Paris. Yorke announced this week that he would tour North America in September, after a string of European shows in June and July. Last week, Radiohead released an 18-hour trove of private recordings from its 1997 album OK Computer after being hacked last week by a person who is reported to have demanded $150,000 to return the recordings. The band uploaded the 1.8-gigabyte collection of recording session outtakes and rare live performances on Bandcamp, and the proceeds will go to climate activists Extinction Rebellion.
