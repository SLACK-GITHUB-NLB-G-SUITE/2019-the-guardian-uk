Northern Exposure. It’s so quirky and dark and surreal and human. My friend’s five-year-old daughter Beatrix. She’s a true master of cutting lines, wild impressions and surrealist improvisation. I hope she never grows out of it. Once during the Perth fringe festival, no less than seven people had to be taken out of my show by security because they wouldn’t stop yelling “Cats ARE furry” at me. They were extremely drunk and misheard a joke I’d said. I once broke up a fight on the street while wearing a penguin-head beanie. I’m not particularly tall, so the penguin’s face was more at eye level with the drunk guy than I was. Those chicken nuggets that are shaped to look like dinosaurs. Chickens evolved from dinosaurs, and now humans are trying to mash them back into dinosaurs. The time an apprentice hairdresser stuffed up my fringe and I looked like I’d had a frontal lobotomy. I tried to pass it off as retro, but it turns out there’s not a lot of nostalgia left for the early 1900s. Probably that we’re all going to die. Everyone, everything. Hideous and hilarious all at once. Laura Davis plays Soho Theatre: Upstairs, W1, Thursday 20 to 22 June
