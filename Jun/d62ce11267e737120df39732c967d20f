And then there were two. What a blessed relief it is to type those words. That relief is particularly keenly felt because it means that political commentators opining on the Conservative leadership contest can no longer wield ad nauseam their preferred, oh-so predictable horse-racing cliches – runners and riders, the field, jockeying for position, the winning post being in sight. It will also remove from my mind the image of Boris Johnson being poured into his racing silks. Far too queasy-making to contemplate. Not so much Royal Ascot as a donkey derby. On the subject of the Tory tourney, I’m not quite sure what came over Jon Snow on Channel 4 News. Interviewing Jacob Rees-Mogg, he introduced a new phrase to the English canon – to queer the pudding. Say what you will about Rees-Mogg, he rarely seems to be taken aback by anything. But even he reacted with a deliciously cocked eyebrow at this thought-provoking coinage. I was equally bemused by another pundit discussing the parlous situation in Hong Kong. “It effectively stamps the scarlet letter on the enclave’s top leadership.” Perhaps this is a reference to Nathaniel Hawthorne, but I’m not sure. Last week, I wrote about an exciting career opportunity denied to me, namely becoming a cryptozoologist. Now I discover yet another fantastic avenue, a lightning protection consultant, who, after recent weather, should be fielding hundreds of calls from worried property owners. On the other hand, you could always follow the advice of the great Lee Trevino: “If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron.” Sorry, that gag’s strictly for devotees of the noble game. •Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist
