A murder investigation has been launched after a tent was set alight in a suspected arson attack in east London. Two men believed to be in their 40s were taken to hospital with burn injuries after firefighters were called to the North Circular Road in Wanstead late on Tuesday night. One of them died in hospital on Wednesday, while the other remains in a critical condition, Scotland Yard said. The London fire brigade said four fire engines and about 25 firefighters tackled the blaze, which completely destroyed a tent and damaged a large area of wasteland. The Metropolitan police said the identities of the victims were unknown and two men were in custody after being arrested on suspicion of arson and attempted murder. DS Ian Valentine said: “We are working hard to establish the circumstances that led to this fatal fire and we believe the public can assist us with our investigation. “We know that after the fire started, two men came out on to the A406 in an attempt to seek assistance from passing drivers. Anyone who believes they may have seen these two people on the verge or stopped to speak to them is urged to contact us. “In particular, we are keen to hear from anyone who has any relevant dashcam footage.” The man’s death is the sixth suspected homicide in as many days. A 38-year-old man died after a triple stabbing in Barnet, north London, on Tuesday night. The previous day, Giedrius Juskauskas, a Lithuanian national, was stabbed to death in Stratford, east London, in the early hours. Their deaths followed three suspected murders in the space of 24 hours. Cheyon Evans, 18, was found with stab wounds in Wandsworth, south-west London, at 4.42pm on Friday. He died at the scene. Eniola Aluko, 19, was shot dead in Plumstead shortly before 5pm on Friday. On Saturday, Gleb Stanislavovitch Zhebrovsky was stabbed to death in Limehouse, east London, just before 2pm.
