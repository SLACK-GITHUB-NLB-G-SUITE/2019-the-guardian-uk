I am a custodian of trees, a guardian of green leaf. And there is nothing greener than new-born leaf, unless it is the kitten-soft needles of spring larch. We have returned to the Danish plot for the bank holiday with summer work to do – and we turn in from the path to a cathedral window of shimmering, shivering life. The trees have come into their own. The birch are shedding bark, paper thin. Most beech have a fuzz of citrus-green leaf. Other trees are yet reluctant. It has been dry, the soil here sandy this close to the beach. I set up a hose in the sheltered spots under the canopy to give them a kick start before the forecast rain. The first thing we see on arrival is a perfect bunch of lily of the valley. Others are scattered along the bank, a spill of primroses (everything is almost a month later here) and violets nestle in the feet of the pine and larch. It is as though the naturalised tulips have waited. We watch as they open and close as the sun passes through. The pear blossom is over, the apple still to come. The rugosa shot through with jagged leaf like my mum’s home haircuts. It is a slower gardening, the caring for trees, the work of lifetimes. Except perhaps the larch which leap up every year, the pine not far behind. Oaks, always the last to full leaf, tower over the plot. The favourite of the woodpeckers drumming their morning and evening call. Favourite, too, of the red squirrel sitting on the branch dropping shredded pine cones stripped of seed. A song thrush calls from a tall sycamore at the back, a blackbird shrieks indignantly if we get close to its nest in the hazel. Its mate flies in, beak packed with worms like a puffin. A self-contained habitat we are lucky to be part of. Order Morning: How to Make Time by Allan Jenkins, for £7.91, from guardianbookshop.com
