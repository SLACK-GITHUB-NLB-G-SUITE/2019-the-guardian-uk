Were you a fan of Black Mirror before? Huge. Seen every episode of every season. What was your favourite episode? Nosedive. What drew you to the script? I think it’s an important story that needs to be told, such a realistic take on what it’s like working in the music industry. It really portrays the overt exploitation of artists and that numbers usually eclipse the creative most of the time. How much did you contribute to the formation of the character? Did you suggests things that weren’t in the script? It was a great collaboration, but there is a part of Ashley O that is not a character. I worked closely with Anne, the director and the show creators to share some of my personal experiences and help craft the episode. Was the world of pop it portrayed familiar to you? Eerily so … yes. You can see it playing out in the media right now. There’s huge similarities with what we see in pop music today. What are your favourite sci-fi films/shows? BLACK MIRROR! It has the most unique perspective on the dark side of technology. • Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June.
