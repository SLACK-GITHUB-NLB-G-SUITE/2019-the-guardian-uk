An explosion on the set of the new James Bond movie at Pinewood Studios has injured a crew member and damaged a stage. The “controlled explosion” damaged the outside of the famous 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, where the spy franchise is filmed. No one working inside the studio was hurt, but one crew member outside suffered a minor injury, the filmmakers said. A tweet from the official James Bond account said: “During the filming of a controlled explosion on the set of Bond 25 today at Pinewood Studios, damage was caused to the exterior of the 007 Stage. “There were no injuries on set, however one crew member outside the stage has sustained a minor injury.” The Sun newspaper said a triple blast hit the set after a stunt went wrong, taking off part of the roof and several wall panels. It comes after Bond star Daniel Craig was injured last month while filming in Jamaica, forcing the actor, 51, to undergo “minor ankle surgery” that required two weeks of rehabilitation. The 25th Bond instalment will be Craig’s fifth outing as 007. Oscar winner Rami Malek will play the villain in the long-awaited movie that is set to see Craig bow out after eight years as 007. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, Naomie Harris and Jeffrey Wright are also returning. Captain Marvel star Lashana Lynch and Game Night actor Billy Magnussen are joining the cast. Production of the film has been repeatedly delayed over script disputes, prompted in part by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle’s replacement by Cary Fukunaga in September. The film is now due to open in cinemas in the United States, Britain and France on 8 April, 2020.
