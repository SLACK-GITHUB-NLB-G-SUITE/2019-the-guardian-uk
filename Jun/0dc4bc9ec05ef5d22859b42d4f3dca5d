When is a race so far removed from what was billed that it is a different race entirely? The question occurs after watching several contests on Thursday evening, all of which involved important departures from the script presented to punters on the racecard. Four of these races were at Ffos Las’s evening meeting, where the sun came out and the decision was taken to omit the two flights in the home straight in the last four races on the card. This meant that in the two scheduled contests over two miles, the field galloped the length of the home straight and around the bend, jumped four flights down the back and then had a run-in from the final flight of well over half a mile. Two more races, over around two-and-a-half miles, also lost four hurdles each. The two-mile events in particular were billed as jumps races, but were just as much Flat races with a smattering of hurdles thrown in. The safety of horses and riders is an overriding concern, however, so while some punters might complain about health and safety gone mad, the stewards really had little choice in the circumstances. If there is a lesson to be learned here, it may well be that it is not the greatest of ideas to schedule a jumps meeting for an evening in early June when half of the obstacles will need to be removed if the sun comes out. But these were not the only races yesterday evening that did not take place as planned. In the last race at Hamilton, a 13-runner sprint handicap, two of the runners swapped stalls. Samovar, who had been due to start from stall seven, went into box 12 instead and went on to finish second, while Gift In Time went into seven and finished unplaced. The mistake was picked up immediately by the pundits on Racing TV, among whom there was a feeling that the race might be declared void as a result.. The stewards duly held an inquiry, which blamed the jockeys concerned – Nathan Evans and Paddy Mathers – and suspended both riders for one day. The result, though, was allowed to stand. No one wants to see races declared void. It is costly, annoys winning punters intensely and it is also more than a little embarrassing. But if a race is not run with the horses in the correct stalls, it is difficult to argue with any certainty that the result has not been affected. In this particular case, Samovar outran his odds of 14-1 to finish a close second on a part of the track which had seemed less favourable earlier in the afternoon. Had he been able to race down the centre, as might well have been the case from his proper stall, Samovar could well have been the winner. No one can be sure, of course, but anyone who backed Samovar has every right to feel that they did not get a fair run for their money. And if punters are left feeling cheated through no fault of their own, it does seem to add insult to injury if the stewards deem it worthy of no more than a one-day suspension. Brighton stages the only Flat meeting of on Friday and Oisin Murphy will be hoping to pad his lead in the jockeys’ championship before heading along the coast to Goodwood this evening. He has a decent chance of a treble on Taxilwala (2.00), Leopardina (2.30) and Fair Power (3.35) while Carp Kid (8.10) is another decent chance for the front-runner in the title race later on. Course specialist Narjes (4.40) could be the pick of the prices at Brighton though, while Redrosezorro (6.55) should also go well at the evening meeting at Haydock.
