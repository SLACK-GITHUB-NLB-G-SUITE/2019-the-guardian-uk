Fifa has formally opened disciplinary proceedings against Cameroon over their players’ behaviour in Sunday’s Women’s World Cup defeat to England. On two occasions during the last-16 contest in Valenciennes, Cameroon players remonstrated with the match officials at length and looked as if they may not play on after VAR decisions went against them. After his side’s 3-0 win the England manager, Phil Neville, said “it didn’t feel like football” and spoke of feeling “completely and utterly ashamed of the behaviour” of Cameroon’s players. A Fifa spokesperson said on Wednesday: “Following the round-of-16 match between Cameroon and England on 23 June at the Women’s World Cup, we can confirm that proceedings have now been opened by the Fifa Disciplinary Committee against the Cameroonian FA for alleged breaches related to article 52 (team misconduct) and article 57 (offensive behaviour and fair play) of the Fifa Disciplinary Code. “As proceedings are now ongoing, please understand that no further comment can be made at this stage,” the spokesperson added. “Further updates will be provided in due course.” Fifa had previously announced they were investigating the Cameroon team’s behaviour on Monday. The two moments of fierce protest from Cameroon where it appeared play might not be able to continue came either side of half time. First, Ellen White’s disallowed goal was overturned via VAR to make it 2-0, having originally been ruled offside. Just after the break, Ajara Nchout’s strike was disallowed for offside following a VAR review. The ill-tempered game at the Stade du Hainaut also saw yellow cards issued to Cameroon’s Yvonne Leuko after catching Nikita Parris in the face with an elbow, and Alexandra Takounda for a poor challenge on Steph Houghton. There was also an incident in which England’s Toni Duggan had her arm spat on by Augustine Ejangue. The Cameroon manager, Alain Djeumfa, said there had been a “miscarriage of justice” and that “the referee made a lot of mistakes”.
