Everton are close to the permanent signing of André Gomes after agreeing a fee of £22m plus add-ons for the Barcelona midfielder. Gomes enjoyed a successful loan last season at Goodison Park, where regular first-team football and a healthy relationship with the manager, Marco Silva, helped to rejuvenate a career that had stalled. Everton did not have an option to buy the Portugal international, a situation that invited West Ham to make several bids for the 25-year-old, but Gomes made clear to the Spanish champions that he wanted to stay at Goodison. That helped Everton to secure a deal that is expected to rise to around £25m with bonus payments. Gomes’s arrival will coincide with Nikola Vlasic turning his loan at CSKA Moscow into a £14m transfer. The Croatia international was the last of many ill-fated signings under Ronald Koeman, costing £10m in 2017, and started only 11 games for Everton. Leighton Baines has signed a 12-month contract extension to stay at the club next season. Burnley could be forced into seeking buyers for Tom Heaton after the England goalkeeper turned down a new contract. The 33-year-old, who made a positive impact on regaining his place in the lineup after a lengthy spell out with injury, will enter the final year of his deal next month. Heaton made his 200th appearance for Burnley on the final day of last season and was in effect England’s No 2 behind Jordan Pickford at this month’s Nations League finals. Yet the Burnley captain faces stiff competition to remain first-choice in Sean Dyche’s side, with Nick Pope – another England international – having signed a new long-term deal in May and Joe Hart also on the books. The latter also has one year to run on his contract and Burnley are unlikely to risk both experienced goalkeepers departing on frees next summer. Clubs including Bournemouth and Aston Villa have been credited with interest in Heaton.
