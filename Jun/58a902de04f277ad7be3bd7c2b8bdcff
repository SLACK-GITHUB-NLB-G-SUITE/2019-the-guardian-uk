Celtic will open their Champions League qualifying campaign against Bosnian side Sarajevo. Neil Lennon’s side will play a side managed by the former Hearts striker Husref Musemic in the first qualifying round as they seek to reach the group stages for a third time in four years. The treble-treble winners are provisionally due to play at home in the first leg on 9 or 10 July. The Scottish champions missed out on a place in last year’s group stage after being dumped out at the third qualifying round by AEK Athens, although the team did progress to the last 32 of the Europa League under their former manager Brendan Rodgers. Uefa have handed the Scottish champions the added safety net of a bye to the third qualifying round of the Europa League should they fail to get past Sarajevo. Normally teams beaten in the opening Champions League qualifier would enter the lesser competition at the second round, but the loser of Celtic’s first qualifier against Sarajevo will be spared action until the next round due to an odd number of teams. Northern Ireland champions Linfield will face Rosenborg of Norway in their opening Champions League qualifier, Ireland’s Dundalk have been drawn to face Riga of the Latvian Virsliga. The New Saints – the Welsh champions who play at Oswestry in Shropshire – will face the winners of the preliminary round and will be at home for the first leg. The preliminary round is a mini-tournament, in which the Kosovan side Feronikeli take on Lincoln Red Imps of Gibraltar while San Marino’s Tre Penne meet Santa Coloma of Andorra on 25 June, with the two victors progressing to a play-off three days later that will decide who enters the competition proper. There are three qualifying rounds, followed by a play-off round in late August which will decide who joins the 26 teams who have qualified for the group stage. New teams enter at each stage of the qualifying competition.
