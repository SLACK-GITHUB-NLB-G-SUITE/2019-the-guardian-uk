Tributes have been paid to the Leyton Orient manager, Justin Edinburgh, who has died at the age of 49 after suffering a cardiac arrest. The former Tottenham defender was taken to hospital on Monday, just weeks after guiding Orient to promotion back to the Football League. He had just returned from watching his former side Tottenham in the Champions League final. Orient’s chairman, Nigel Travis, said the club had been left “completely heartbroken … All our thoughts and love are with the Edinburgh family. We know from the messages that have flooded into the club over the last week that the wider football world will share our sentiments.” It is with profound and utmost sadness that Leyton Orient announces its manager Justin Edinburgh has passed away.#LOFC #OnlyOneOrient Edinburgh, who also managed Newport, Gillingham and Northampton, made more than 200 appearances as a left-back for Tottenham, winning the FA Cup with them in 1991 and the League Cup in 1999. He then spent three years at Portsmouth before moving to take his first steps in management with Billericay Town. Travis praised Edinburgh’s character as well as his achievements at Orient. “The success that Justin brought was incredible but, more importantly, the impact he had on us all as a winner and a wonderful, inspirational human being will be his legacy. That will stay with us forever.” Tottenham were among the clubs to pay tribute, while his former Spurs team-mate Darren Anderton tweeted: “I can’t believe it … such sad news about Justin, it’s not fair. One of the greatest guys you could ever wish to meet. When you were around him, you just laughed and smiled constantly.” Gary Lineker called him “an excellent coach and a terrific full-back who was a delight to share a dressing room with and have as a team-mate”. His players at Orient also expressed their shock, and their gratitude, with striker Macauley Bonne writing: “There are no words to describe the loss of our gaffer, our leader and inspiration. First and foremost, my deepest condolences to Justin’s family. He brought us all together – we’re eternally grateful for everything you’ve done.” Orient’s player of the season winner, Craig Clay, wrote that Edinburgh was “more than a gaffer to me … I’ll be forever grateful for what you’ve done for me. Rest in peace, Justin.” The League Managers’ Association chairman, Howard Wilkinson, said Edinburgh would be remembered as “a true professional … A hard-working man who became successful as a player at the highest level of the game and turned his love of football into a life-long career as a coach and as a manager. At a time when he should be celebrating the success of his team and preparing for the rewards of league football next season, he has been lost to the game, and to his community, too soon.” Leyton Orient Fans’ Trust issued a statement praising Edinburgh for how he helped turn their club around. “In his 18 months managing our club, Justin became an Orient legend, building an excellent championship-winning team that regained our place in the Football League. Two years ago our club was on the floor. “When Justin arrived, the team was still struggling but his shrewd and tenacious management helped turn our performances around and give us a team we could be proud of – one of the most likeable Orient teams we have known. “He was clearly deeply liked and admired by his players, who owe him a great deal. Ultimately though, football pales into total insignificance at a time like this … He will be greatly missed, on and away from the pitch.” Speaking in April after Orient secured their return to the Football League, Edinburgh had paid tribute to fans who had stuck by the club, and spoke of his ambitions for the future. “Over a period of time we have helped these players grow and I think what we need to realise now is this has to be just the start. We don’t want to step back or stay where we are. We can’t rest, we can’t stand still. We’ve got to try and progress.” Edinburgh leaves wife Kerri and their children Charlie and Cydnie. 💬 "It's been an honour leading this group of players, staff, board of directors and everyone connected with this football club"As seen in Episode 6 of @dreamteamfc's Love of the Game series, here is what Justin Edinburgh said to his players after securing promotion!#LOFC pic.twitter.com/RBlJ8rmb7B
