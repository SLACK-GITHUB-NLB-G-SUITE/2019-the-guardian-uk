My 13-year-old niece is coming from her home in a southern US state to our smallholding in France, as she has for the past four summers. My brother is a single parent and values our input, exposing her to different views and values. My husband and I have introduced her to healthy eating, growing food, raising animals humanely and new cultural experiences. Last year, after we watched The Help, she said: “Thank goodness America isn’t racist like that any more.” I haven’t wanted to contradict her upbringing, which is very white and conservative, but I want to be open, without upsetting my brother or her. How would others go about it? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
