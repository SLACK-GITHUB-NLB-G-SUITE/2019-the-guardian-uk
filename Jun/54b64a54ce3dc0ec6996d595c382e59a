Eliud Kipchoge will attempt to break the two-hour barrier for the marathon in Vienna in October. The Austrian capital has been chosen to host the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, in which the Kenyan world record holder will make his second bid to achieve the feat. Kipchoge ran the marathon in a time of two hours and 25 seconds on the Monza race track in Italy in his previous attempt to break the two-hour mark. He was assisted by pacemakers who ran set sections of the course, meaning it was not recognised as a world record. The 34-year-old 2016 Olympic gold medal winner set the world record in Berlin last September when running 2:01:39, beating the previous best by 78 seconds. He also ran the second-fastest time in history when completing the London Marathon in April in a time of 2:02:37. The Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, said: “Eliud Kipchoge is the greatest ever marathon runner and the only athlete in the world who has any chance of beating the two-hour time. Nobody’s been able to achieve this. It’s not unlike trying to put a man on the moon.” Kipchoge added: “I’ve been informed Vienna has a fast and flat course, nicely protected by trees. The course is as well situated in the heart of this beautiful city, which will enable a great number of spectators to be part of this historical event.”
