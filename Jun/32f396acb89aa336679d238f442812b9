Train passengers at London Euston are facing long delays after lines were forced to close for more than two hours because of a trespasser. Disruption began at about 8am on Saturday when the power on the tracks was turned off so the person could be removed from an area close to the tracks near Carpenders Park, south of Watford. Although the line was reopened shortly before 10.30am, passengers are being warned to expect long delays. Network Rail said delays would have a knock-on effect for the rest of Saturday and advised passengers to check with train operators before travelling. Virgin Trains services to major hubs including Birmingham New Street, Chester, Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central were also subject to delay or cancellation because of the disruption. Services between Watford Junction and Euston or Clapham Junction were likely to be cancelled or delayed by up to 80 minutes, while other London overground and Southern services were also affected.
