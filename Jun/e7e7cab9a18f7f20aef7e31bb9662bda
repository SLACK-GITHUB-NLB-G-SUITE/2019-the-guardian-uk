Derby’s owner Mel Morris has stressed the club want to keep Frank Lampard as manager “for the long term” amid interest from Chelsea. The former Chelsea midfielder Lampard has emerged as the favourite for the Stamford Bridge vacancy following Maurizio Sarri’s move to Juventus. Lampard, who turns 41 on Thursday, is Chelsea’s record goalscorer and won three Premier League titles and the Champions League with the club. However Morris says the Championship club, who missed out on promotion when they were beaten by Aston Villa in last month’s play-off final at Wembley, are determined to hold on to Lampard’s services. He told Sky Sports: “There’s no change in the situation at present, except for the fact that Chelsea no longer have a manager. “We have made it clear to everyone, but most importantly to Frank, that we want him and to retain his services for the long term. If Chelsea want to hire Frank, then it is in their gift to make an offer in pursuit of that. “In the meantime we will continue to put our best foot forward to continue with our plans for the coming season, to work with Frank, for him to know how much he is wanted by everyone associated with the club.” Sarri’s successor will be the 14th different manager employed at Chelsea since owner Roman Abramovich took over in 2003. In his sole season at the club the 60-year-old Italian – who succeeded Antonio Conte last summer – guided the team to Europa League success, third place in the Premier League and the Carabao Cup final. Despite this, fans became frustrated at his regimented tactics and an apparent reluctance to play homegrown talents Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Form was also inconsistent and, with Sarri keen to return to Italy, the club decided agreed a compensation package understood to be in excess of €5m with the Serie A champions.
