Some food items frequently don’t get delivered from a particular restaurant I order from on Deliveroo. Once it was just a case of selecting “missing items”, and a credit would automatically be applied. But on the last two occasions, I’ve received a rather glib email saying: “We can’t offer you credit right now. We will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time.” The first time I was furious. Surely if an item is missing, why should you (or I) pay? I expect I have reported missing items a few too many times (about five times in the last six months) and am on a blacklist. But I use Deliveroo a lot, and almost all of the time with no missing items reported at all. CR, London W13 Deliveroo told us all missing items cases are investigated by a member of staff, and insists that there are no blacklists of customers who have complained too many times about this problem. However, despite claiming that when an item is not delivered “we will, of course, refund this”, it is still refusing to refund you, suggesting something is clearly going on. Is it time to switch restaurants, or to pick up your own takeaway orders? We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
