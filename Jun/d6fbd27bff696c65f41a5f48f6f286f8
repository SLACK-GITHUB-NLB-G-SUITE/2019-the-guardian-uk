The Guardian is right to oppose automated facial recognition (Editorial, 10 June), but in spite of concerns from MPs and peers, parliament has hardly discussed the issue. As the person who organised the only debate on the subject in the House of Lords, I have started legal action against the police for failing to have a regulatory framework for its use. It’s shocking that we are allowing the police and companies to set the rules as we abolish privacy in public spaces, because ministers are failing to act. The difference between ourselves and the likes of China and Russia is that we have a fairly open democracy, but this is no defence against state oppression and commercial exploitation if politicians fail to recognise that when our face becomes an identity card, all the rules change.Jenny JonesGreen party, House of Lords • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
