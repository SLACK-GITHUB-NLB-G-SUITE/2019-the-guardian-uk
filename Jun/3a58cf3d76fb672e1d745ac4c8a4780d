Denmark has became the third Nordic country this year to form a leftist government after the Social Democratic party leader, Mette Frederiksen, finalised terms for a one-party minority government. Aged 41, she becomes the country’s youngest ever prime minister. “It is with great pleasure I can announce that, after three weeks of negotiations, we have a majority to form a new government,” Frederiksen said on Tuesday. A bloc of five left-leaning opposition parties led by Frederiksen’s Social Democratic party won a majority in the 5 June election, prompting centre-right leader Lars Lokke Rasmussen to resign as prime minister. While the leftist opposition bloc got a convincing majority, support for the Social Democratic Party declined slightly compared with the 2015 vote, but it remained the biggest party. Despite differences among left-leaning parties over issues such as welfare and immigration, Frederiksen got their backing to form a one-party minority government, a common arrangement in Denmark. The election results signalled that Danish voters had rebelled against austerity measures, while dealing a blow to rightwing nationalists, who lost more than half of their votes compared with 2015. In Finland and Sweden, the Social Democratic parties formed governments earlier this year.
