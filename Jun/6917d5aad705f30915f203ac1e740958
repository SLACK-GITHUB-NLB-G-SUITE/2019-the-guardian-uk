We’d like to speak to those who believe themselves to be more burned out at this point of the year than has previously been the case. You might have noticed the increased sunshine and warmer temperatures having less of a positive impact on your health or mindset than they have in past summers. Or you might have taken ages to get over an illness from early in the year. Or you might be running yourself ragged with too many work and social commitments. You may also have noticed yourself getting burned out around this time every year and have theories as to why. You may even have taken steps to mitigate it. Either way, we’d be interested to hear your experiences and views of “mid-year burnout”. Does the idea of mid-year burnout resonate with you? If so, does this happen to you every year, or just this year? And what do you think is driving it? Tell us your stories in the encrypted form below – your responses will only be seen by the Guardian. One of our journalists may contact you to find out more about your experience and we will feature some responses in our reporting. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
