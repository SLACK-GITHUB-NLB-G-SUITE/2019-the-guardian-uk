The Medical Women’s Federation feels it is time for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to recognise parental leave for MPs (Editorial, 19 June). If civil servants on maternity leave are entitled to 26 weeks’ full pay then it would seem only right and fair to offer a similar deal to MPs.

Milton Brown and Bob Wills were among the founding fathers. Modern exponents include Asleep At the Wheel and the Hot Club of Cowtown.Jason HillStoke-on-Trent • As a resident of Newton-le-Willows, I take issue with your assertion that it “hasn’t been in Lancashire since 1974” (The great British tea test, 20 June).
