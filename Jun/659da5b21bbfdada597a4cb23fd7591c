Summer in a glass. For the syrup, use a cucumber-flavoured tonic water, if you can – there are a few on the market now, from the likes of Schweppes, Fever-Tree, Lamb & Watt and Double Dutch – but bog-standard tonic will also do, not least because the cocktail itself is flavoured with muddled cucumber. Serves 1 2 x 3cm chunks cucumber50ml gin – we use Hendrick’s 15ml maraschino liqueur – a good one like Luxardo20ml lemon juice15ml tonic sugar syrup (made with equal parts tonic water and caster sugar; if it’s too thick, thin with a little water)50ml apple juice1 sprig mint and 1 strip cucumber, to garnish In a shaker, muddle the cucumber pieces to a puree, then add all the liquids and a handful of ice, and shake hard. Double strain into a goblet, garnish and serve. • Cesare Manfredini, bar manager, The Courtyard, London SW6
