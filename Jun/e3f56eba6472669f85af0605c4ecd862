Two years after the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower, bereaved, survivors and residents are growing increasingly frustrated that there has been no response to their demands for a new consumer regulator for social housing. They want the loss of their loved ones to be a catalyst for positive change. Yet we are still awaiting meaningful action from the government as to how it will ensure tenants in social housing are listened to, and how it will genuinely strengthen the regulation of their landlords. Theresa May’s speech at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference (Opinion, 27 June) spoke of a stronger consumer regulation regime, but we need more than this. If the 9 million social tenants in England are to feel safe in their homes, and assured they’ll receive the standard of service to which they’re entitled, we need a tough new regulator to enforce consumer housing standards. Governments have responded to protect consumers in this way before, creating the Food Standards Agency after a series of high-profile food deaths, and the Financial Conduct Authority following financial scandals. Why should social tenants matter less? Tenants need to know that their wellbeing, health and safety will be protected, and standards rigorously enforced, by a regulator focused on working for them. We call on the government to show social tenants that they matter and will no longer be ignored. When next steps for social housing are announced later this year, the government must go further than their initial proposals. We expect nothing less than a new consumer regulator.Polly Neate CEO, ShelterEd Daffarn Grenfell UnitedRev Dr Mike Long Notting Hill Methodist ChurchJon Sparkes CEO, CrisisRick Henderson CEO, Homeless LinkRyan Shorthouse Director, Bright BlueEd Miliband MP Labour, Doncaster NorthLord Jim O’NeillSamia Badani Co-chair, Notting Dale Residents Advisory BoardRob Gershon Social housing tenant activistDavid Tovey London Tenants’ FederationCaroline Abrahams CEO, Age UKPaul Farmer CEO, MindMiatta Fahnbulleh CEO, New Economics FoundationRaji Hunjan CEO, Zacchaeus 2000 TrustJo Miller CEO, Doncaster Council Professor Anne Power LSE Housing and CommunitiesDr Stuart Hodkinson University of LeedsSteve Hilditch The Campaign for Social HousingRev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
