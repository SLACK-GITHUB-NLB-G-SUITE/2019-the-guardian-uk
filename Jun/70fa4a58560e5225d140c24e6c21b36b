Representatives of the pioneering rapper Bushwick Bill said on Sunday he was hospitalized in critical condition but still alive, contrary to some reports. Bill’s publicist, Dawn P, told the AP the rapper was on a ventilator at a Colorado hospital. She said hospital officials confirmed his condition on Sunday morning and that his family was traveling to be with him. Pete Marrero, Bill’s Dallas-based business manager, said the 52-year-old was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in February and is not expected to recover. Bill, whose legal name is Richard Shaw and who was born in Jamaica, had been planning to go on tour around the time he was hospitalized. Bill is a founding member of Houston rap group the Geto Boys. Reports of his death proliferated on Sunday after a bandmate wrote a post on Instagram suggesting it had occurred.
