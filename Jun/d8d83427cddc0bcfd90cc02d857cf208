A net bowler has been taken to hospital for checks after being struck on the head from a shot by the Australia batsman David Warner during a training session at the Oval. Training was immediately halted as the bowler was attended to straight away by medical staff on site. As a precaution with any head injury, the necessary checks were made, with the man put on to a stretcher and then taken away to hospital for further examination. An ICC spokesman said the bowler was “responding well” and was “conscious when he left”. Warner took some time out for the session once training resumed, before returning to the nets. Australia, the defending champions, have won both their matches and resume their campaign against India at the Oval on Sunday.
