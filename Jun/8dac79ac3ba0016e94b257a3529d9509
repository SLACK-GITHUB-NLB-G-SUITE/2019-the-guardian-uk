Reigning Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas has been taken to hospital after he abandoned the Tour de Suisse following a heavy crash during stage four of the race on Tuesday. The Welshman fell 27 kilometres from the finish in Arlesheim and received treatment from medical staff after apparently injuring his right shoulder before eventually abandoning the race. Astana rider Andrey Zeits was also involved in the crash and he was immediately taken to hospital in an ambulance. “Sadly @GeraintThomas86 has been forced to abandon the #TourDeSuisse,” said Team Ineos on Twitter. “He was alert and speaking to the team after the crash and will be taken to hospital for checks.” The incident comes a week after his teammate Chris Froome was ruled out of next month’s Tour de France after suffering multiple injuries in a horror crash in training.
