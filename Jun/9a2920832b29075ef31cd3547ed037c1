The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has received a personal letter from Donald Trump and will put serious thought into its content, North Korea’s state-run news agency KCNA has said. In a report published early on Sunday in Asia, KCNA did not give details on the letter, but said Kim described it as “of excellent content”. “Kim Jong-un said that he would seriously contemplate the interesting content,” the report said. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump recently said he had received a “beautiful” letter from Kim. US-North Korea talks have been stalled since a failed summit in February between Trump and the North Korean leader in Hanoi, Vietnam. A US official said on Wednesday that the United States had no pre-conditions for new talks but progress would require meaningful and verifiable North Korean steps to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Trump is due to visit South Korea next week for meetings with President Moon Jae-in after taking part in the G20 meetings in Japan.
