‘The expanding empire of law is one of the most significant phenomena of our time.” So observed the recently retired supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption in the first of his Reith lectures two weeks ago. Last week, as if on cue to provide evidence for Sumption’s thesis, Boris Johnson was summoned to court, accused of lying during the Brexit referendum campaign when he said that Britain gave £350m a week to the EU. The claim may have been factually untrue. A lie, even. Allegedly. But the worst thing that could have happened to that alleged lie was for it to have ended up in court. If Johnson were a doctor or a lawyer, lying to a patient or a client might rightly result in a court case. But a politician is not like a doctor or a lawyer. Such professions are regulated by professional bodies and answerable to the law. Politicians have to obey the law. But for their arguments and statements they should be answerable only to the electorate. Democracy requires the electorate to judge the claims of politicians – including their veracity – and to vote accordingly. Before the 2010 election, Nick Clegg promised to abolish student tuition fees. In power, as part of the Lib Dem-Tory coalition, he raised them. It wasn’t a court that decided the punishment. It was the electorate, who turfed out Clegg and gave a kicking to the Lib Dems at the following election. Johnson has not suffered the same fate – yet. That should lead us not to court but to examine more carefully the reasons so many voted Leave. “As politics has lost its prestige,” Sumption observed in his second Reith lecture, “judges have been ready to fill the gap.” But once we turn to the criminal law to police political argument, it’s democracy that suffers. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist
