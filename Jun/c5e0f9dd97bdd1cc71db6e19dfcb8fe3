Chelsea have confirmed that Maurizio Sarri has left the club after one season as head coach and joined Juventus. The club will now approach Derby for talks with Frank Lampard in the hope of appointing him. Chelsea said in a statement they had terminated Sarri’s contract with two years to run at the Italian’s request. At the same time Juventus announced Sarri’s arrival on a three-year deal. The Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said: “In talks we had following the Europa League final, Maurizio made it clear how strongly he desired to return to his native country, explaining that his reasons for wanting to return to work in Italy were significant. “He also believed it important to be nearer his family, and for the well-being of his elderly parents he felt he needed to live closer to them at this point. Maurizio leaves Chelsea with thanks from us all for the work he and his assistants did.” Sarri won the Europa League in his final Chelsea match and led the club to third place in the Premier League. Juventus moved for him after Massimiliano Allegri stood down having won Serie A in each of his five seasons there. Juventus have agreed to pay compensation to Chelsea which could rise to more than £5m depending on how Sarri fares. Getting Lampard from Derby could cost £4m. Chelsea want to appoint their former midfielder well before pre-season training starts in the first week of July.
