Armageddon is a chess penalty shoot-out, a controversial format intended to prevent draws and to stimulate interesting play. It can also lead to chaotic scrambles where pieces fall off the board, players bang down their moves and hammer the clocks, and fractions of a second decide the result. That is what happened in Tuesday’s Levon Aronian v Alexander Grischuk game at Altibox Norway. The loser called it “among the top three most disappointing defeats in my life”. In an Armageddon game, White has more thinking time on the clock than Black, but a draw on the board scores as a black win. Normally White has five or six minutes and Black four or five for the entire game, but in the current Altibox Norway tournament it is 10 against seven. In response to growing complaints about too many draws, the Altibox organisers made a controversial decision this year to limit classical games to four hours and to replay draws immediately as Armageddons. The scoring system is 2 points for a classical win, 1.5 for a classical draw and an Armageddon win, 0.5 for a classical draw and an Armageddon loss, and 0 for a classical loss. Altibox is the annual event at Stavanger where Magnus Carlsen performs against his global rivals. Despite playing in his own backyard, Norway’s world champion has won Altibox only once previously in six attempts, and has twice finished near the bottom. This year, though, Caissa is so far smiling on Carlsen, who was losing on the board and far behind on the clock against Aronian, but still managed to halve the classical game before defeating the now demoralised Armenian in Armageddon. Going into Friday’s rest day after three rounds the leaders are Carlsen 5/6, Ding Liren (China), Wesley So (US) and Aronian all 4/6. Carlsen’s total comes from one classical win and two Armageddon wins. The new Altibox format has triggered a fierce debate among internet viewers, with a large majority of the hundreds of comments critical of Armageddon and/or of the scoring system which downgrades classical games. However, the most hostile posts came after round one when all five games went to Armageddon including the Aronian v Grischuk shambles. In round two there were three Armageddons, and in round three only one, while the quality of the games improved. Carlsen is in favour: “There has been plenty of fight in the classical games, and having Armageddon just gives it an extra dimension. It’s just extra excitement every day. I am sure there are people who like it, people who don’t like it, but I think it’s been very exciting so far and I look forward to the future,” he said. So the Armageddon jury is still out, and the arguments will continue when Altibox Norway resumes with round four (of nine) starting at 4pm on Saturday. 3622 (a) Black wins by 1...Kg3! and h5-h4-h3-h2 mate. (b) White wins by 1 f6! gxf6 2 Kxg2 Kg5 3 a4 bxa3 ep 4 bxa3 Kf5 5 a4 Ke5 6 d6! cxd6 7 c6! dxc6 8 a5 and White queens. The world champion’s third round win against Grischuk’s Grunfeld Defence was a masterclass in using a bishop pair in partnership with advancing f and h pawns to open up a defender’s king. Carlsen criticised 10…Bxf3 as “strategically risky” and he immediately went on the attack. Grischuk said later that Black is lost after 18 h4! though some of the tactics are complex. If Black tries 21…Nxc3 then 22 fxg6 fxg6 23 Bg4 Nxe4 24 Be6+ Kh7 25 Qe1! leads to mate, while later 27...Nxe4 is met by 28 Bxe4 fxe4 29 Rxf7! Kxf7 30 Qd5+ and soon mates. The actual finish was more prosaic as, with the black army absent on the queen’s side, Carlsen’s queen and rook caught the black king at h7. 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5 4 cxd5 Nxd5 5 e4 Nxc3 6 bxc3 Bg7 7 Be3 c5 8 Rc1 Qa5 9 Qd2 O-O 10 Nf3 Bg4 11 d5 b5 12 Be2 Nd7 13 O-O Bxf3? 14 Bxf3 c4 15 Be2 Rfd8 16 f4!
