The legendary sports writer Hugh McIlvanney, who died earlier this year, wrote about ‘The mad world of Muhammad Ali’ for the 23 March 1975 issue of the Observer Magazine. McIlvanney had previously interviewed Ali just hours after the Rumble in the Jungle fight in Zaire in 1974 and here he turned his attention to just what Ali was going to do after he retired from boxing. Ali is pictured standing outside one of two tower blocks he was planning to buy in Chicago, aiming to do the same as his neighbour, the Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. ‘They’ll cost me millions, but they’ll make me money while I’m asleep.’ McIlvanney writes about the house Ali had just bought in Chicago, Woodlawn, as being his ‘latest exercise in the impossible: his attempt to put down roots on the run’. McIlvanney and a photographer were ‘trying to hang on to his coat tails’ as he zipped around the US trying to get beyond the ‘familiar stage act’. And beyond what he called Ali’s ‘medicine show’, McIlvanney is ‘touched by a vague melancholy, a sense perhaps of romantic aspirations in collision with nature’. A companion of Ali’s says, ‘When you’re around, man, they fall out of the sky – it rains pretty foxes.’ McIlvanney writes: ‘The interesting point is that these days his umbrella seems to be upside down’, a brilliant euphemism for his JFK-like carousing. McIlvanney worries that, ‘In the decades to come, restlessness will preclude tranquillity,’ that this will be ‘part of the great penalty Ali will have to pay for the great flood of wilful energy that has carried him so far in his first 32 years.’ Three years after Ali’s last fight in 1981, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and trying to hold on to some of that wilful energy was probably the greatest challenge he ever faced.
