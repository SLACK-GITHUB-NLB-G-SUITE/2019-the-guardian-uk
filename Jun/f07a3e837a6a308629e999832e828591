Network Rail has made a bid for parts of British Steel ahead of a deadline for offers for the company, which collapsed into liquidation last month putting 4,500 jobs at risk. Potential bidders had until the end of Sunday to make offers. About a dozen were thought to have expressed interest in buying all or parts of the business, after 80 parties made preliminary enquiries. Network Rail said it would only pursue its offer if another buyer is not found. The company, which manages the UK’s rail tracks, has made the bid to avoid the possibility of losing one of its most important suppliers. The British railway system is heavily dependent on products from British Steel, which account for 97% of the steel used in tracks. Network Rail said: “We have made an indicative offer for some railway critical assets although our overwhelming preference is that a purchaser for the entire business is found. We are very clear that our offer will not undermine that. “Our role is to safely run the railway for the millions of people who rely on it every day and we are exploring all options to make sure we can continue to do that.” British Steel collapsed in May after private equity owners Greybull Capital asked the government for £30m to help avert its collapse. Greybull had bought Tata’s long products division in 2016 for £1 and revived the British Steel brand. The company quickly returned to profitability in the 2016-17 financial year, but has since struggled. Greybull, which made millions of pounds in fees from British Steel, said that Brexit-related uncertainty had added to problems, with European buyers wary of committing to purchases that could be hit by tariffs if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The bulk of British Steel’s employees are based in Scunthorpe, the Lincolnshire site of the company’s blast furnaces. The company also has operations in Teeside.
