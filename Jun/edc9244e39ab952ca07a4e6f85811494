“Shurrup Yew Ye Tick was a meme!” says Tom from Dublin. “Tick is Irish slang for someone saying you’re silly or something. It’s like: ‘Shut up you tick.’” “It’s nobody’s dog, it’s just a meme!” his friend Andy, also from Dublin, says. We’ve all learned something about Irish internet culture circa 2015, but the dog is frankly terrifying. “We play in a softball league and our team is called Base Invaders – it’s a pun!” says Steven from London. Great pun, but possibly the most extraordinary thing about Steven’s flag is that there are at least five softball players at Glastonbury. Apparently it’s “huge”. “Why have I got Dave Grohl on a stick? Because he was headlining two years ago and I’m too lazy to change it,” says Ryan from south Wales. Can Ryan’s friends find him with a flag so small that it’s the size of a human head? “I’m 6ft 2in, so that’s quite high up when my arm’s stretched.” Sharon Dainton from Melbourne in Derbyshire has been coming to Glastonbury since 1986. “In the old days, I used to carry a pig on a stick flag so my mates could find me. Then one year, there were 15 pigs on sticks so I had to rethink. Now “piiig” is a catchphrase among my friends. Catherine Caddy and her mates have come from London to Glastonbury as traffic cones for no other reason than to have a laugh. “We’ve been stopping traffic,” she says, “and letting the tractors pass!” The flag, which features three cones with her face on, reads: “Sees tickets, buys tickets.” This is because she was extraordinarily lucky, managing to buy tickets for all 18 of her friends. So the flag is a homage to Catherine and her supernaturally fast internet connection. She wins for sheer tenacity and dedication to the cause.
