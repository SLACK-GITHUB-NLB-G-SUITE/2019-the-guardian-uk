There’s no hiding that I’m a massive Marvel movies fan. Over the past 11 years, the quest for the infinity stones played an integral part in the Marvel cinematic universe. As a celebration of this, I’ve recreated the power stone – normally to be found on the fictional planet Morag (sorry, geek moment) – as a fruit pastille, using forest fruits and a herby, sugar coating. So that’s one stone found and just five more to go. Avengers assemble! Fruit pastilles are easy to make, but be prepared to do some stirring and thermometer-watching. Use a bag of defrosted black forest fruits (blackberries, cherries, grapes and blackcurrants) or a seasonal glut. Prep 15 minChill 2 hr+Cook 15 minMakes 16-20 300g black forest fruits, defrosted190g caster sugarJuice of 1 lemon50g liquid glucose 10g pectin For the basil sugar1 large handful basil 90g caster sugar Put the fruit in a saucepan with 80g of the caster sugar and a generous splash of water, and cook gently until the berries have softened. Blitz the fruit mixture in a food processor until smooth, or push it through a fine sieve. Return the fruit puree to the pan set over a medium heat and mix in the lemon juice, liquid glucose, pectin and the rest of the caster sugar. Heat until the mixture reaches 105-115C (221-239F) on a thermometer (depending on how soft or hard you want the pastilles to be), stirring occasionally, so the mixture doesn’t burn. Pour into a small, square baking tin lined with clingfilm, then leave to set in the fridge for a few hours. Meanwhile, pulse the basil and sugar in a processor until combined and finely ground. Once the pastilles are set, cut into squares and toss each one in the herb sugar.
