The subheading on your article (The 14 rules for going vegan, G2, 19 June) says: “The environmental, health and ethical benefits of veganism are beyond doubt.” This sounds plausible, but one must think rather more critically about this subject. I’d be more than happy if you replaced “veganism” with “rejecting industrialised food production”. But does anyone think that a move to plant-based eating that includes, for example, monoculture (almonds), habitat destruction (palm oil) and food miles (avocados) is something we should aim for? There are lots of good arguments for changing our diet, but thought must be given to the means of food production and distribution. Big Food doesn’t care about what’s inside the burger; it’s only interested in the inside of wallets and uninquiring minds.Matthew LoukesLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
