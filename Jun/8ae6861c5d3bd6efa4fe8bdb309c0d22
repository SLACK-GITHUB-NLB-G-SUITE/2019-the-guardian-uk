Cristiana Girelli scored a hat-trick and the substitute Aurora Galli struck twice as Italy thrashed Jamaica 5-0 which virtually guaranteed qualification for the last 16 of the Womenâ€™s World Cup. Back in the tournament after a 20-year absence, the Azzurre top Group C with six points ahead of Brazil and Australia who have three. Jamaica have yet to earn a point. Girelli opened the scoring with a retaken, VAR-awarded penalty before netting again either side of the interval. Galli rounded off the victory with two goals after coming on midway through the second half. Schools from around Reims brought their students to the game, giving the atmosphere an upbeat feel. Three days after the USA thrashed Thailand 13-0 the Stade Auguste Delaune crowd were treated to more champagne football. Italy went ahead after 12 minutes when Girelli converted a penalty on her second attempt, having had to retake her spot kick after Sydney Schneider had stepped off her line. The penalty was awarded following a VAR review after Allyson Swaby brought down Barbara Bonansea. Girelli doubled the tally in the 25th minute by latching on to a corner before securing her hat-trick shortly after the restart, jumping higher than Schneider to head home. Galli added the fourth shortly after coming on for Valentina Bergamaschi with a thunderous strike from outside the area and then she rounded Schneider and tapped the ball into the net to wrap up an impressive win. Italy play Brazil in their final group game while Jamaica face Australia.
