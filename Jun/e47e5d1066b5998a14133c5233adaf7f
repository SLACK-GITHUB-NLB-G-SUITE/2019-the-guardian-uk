The Lebanon Rugby League Federation has threatened Cedars players with jail, fines and suspension if they follow through with a protest during Saturday’s Test with Fiji. The LRLF on Wednesday issued a statement hitting back at Cedars skipper Robbie Farah and fellow players who are planning to cover up the governing body’s logo when they run onto Leichhardt Oval. The players are disputing the LRLF’s recent board elections amid complaints that the country has failed to capitalise on its 2017 World Cup success where they went within two points of beating Tonga in the quarter-finals. In response the LRLF threatened the players with arrest if they followed through with their plans. The LRLF said in a statement: “Consequently, on Tuesday, 18 June, the board decided upon the following resolutions. “1. Any player who conceals the Cedars badge – which is the emblem the federation selected to be worn by the representative of al watan, the nation – will face misconduct charges. “2. Any player who conceals the Cedars badge will be suspended with immediate effect pending the outcomes of any misconduct hearing. “3. The LRLF will seek significant monetary fines on any person found guilty of misconduct related to this incident. “4. The Lebanese public prosecutor’s office has been made aware of the incident and will launch an investigation in coordination with the LRLF. It is a criminal offence to denigrate the national emblem of the Republic of Lebanon.” Farah on Monday said that the Lebanon-based player had boycotted the local competition because of their grievances and unless it resumed the Cedars could be stripped of their place in the 2021 World Cup. However, the LRLF disputed this, saying it had no basis.
