The front-page headline “Oxford falls to third place in university rankings” (8 June) could just as easily– and more positively – have read: “St Andrews rises to second place in university rankings.” Is this an example of favouring negative news over positive, or is it simply anti-Scottish prejudice? Congratulations to St Andrews.Fiona CollinsCarrog, Denbighshire • It’s unfortunate that in mentioning Melissa Harrison’s novel, All Among the Barley, you pictured her against a field of wheat (The books that made me, Review, 8 June).Sue LeylandHunmanby, North Yorkshire • No doubt there will be people in Peterborough seeking to overturn Labour’s small majority (Letters, 8 June). They will, of course, be given that chance on 5 May 2022, (a little under three years). Fortunately, democracy allows the electorate the opportunity to change its mind. Sometimes.Jane TaylorSherborne, Dorset • One of our managers used to give candidates a bottle of water (Dirty mugs and dirtier mind games, G2, 6 June). If they drank from the bottle instead of pouring it into a glass they were automatically rejected as “they weren’t the kind of people we wanted in the firm”.Bill OnwusahLondon • As a teacher who lived through Michael Gove’s tenure as education secretary, I wonder if his drug habit might have lasted rather longer than he has admitted (Report, 10 June).Phil BadgerElsecar, South Yorkshire • I feel Michael Gove would make a more flexible Brexit negotiator than Theresa May. He would surely replace her red lines with white ones.Rick GwiltGlossop, Derbyshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
