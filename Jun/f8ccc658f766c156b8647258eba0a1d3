Naomi Osaka’s winning grand slam run came to a disappointing end in a straight-sets defeat to Katerina Siniakova in the third round of the French Open. The world No 1 had won 16 consecutive slam matches, taking in titles at the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open. Osaka had also won her opening two matches here but had looked short of her best form, losing opening sets against both Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Victoria Azarenka. That pattern continued here and she could not find a way back against the world No 42, who prevailed 6-4 6-2. After the first eight games were shared, Siniakova broke to lead 5-4 having saved seven break points. The Czech player served out for the first set, and Osaka’s performance deteriorated further in the second. A double fault on break point left her 5-2 down and Siniakova completed the upset. Osaka ended the match with 38 unforced errors as Siniakova, the world doubles No 1, reached the singles fourth round at a slam for the first time. Simona Halep is the only one of the top six women’s seeds to reach the last 16, after she cruised past Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko. The defending champion complained of feeling unwell after her second-round match, but had no concerns during the 55-minute contest, winning 6-2 6-1.
