Hummingbird x Paul SmithPrice £3,995, hummingbirdbike.comFrame carbonWeight 6.9kgGears single speed Socks, ties, shirts, wallets, watches, furniture, crockery, bedlinen, beach towels, loo seats… There are few things Paul Smith has not put stripes on. Now the great man of British style has added his unique aesthetic to the world’s lightest folding bike. The fact a bike has been given his signature treatment is hardly a surprise – Sir Paul is a huge cycling buff. If it were not for a bad crash as he was starting out he might have gone on to race as a pro. While not riding, he has amassed a vast collection of cycling memorabilia. Stored in the basement of his Covent Garden HQ you’ll find everything from old jerseys and race programmes to an envy-inducing stable of sleek bikes given to him by his friends in the professional peloton. On the racks you’ll find Mark Cavendish’s World Championship bike from 2011 and Sir Bradley’s Tour de France Pinarello Dogma 8. Soon, Paul Smith will be finding a corner to show off this limited-edition Hummingbird, too. The bike is made at the same facility that produces Aston Martin racing cars. And, like the cars, it’s fast, light and looks as smooth as it rides. Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166
