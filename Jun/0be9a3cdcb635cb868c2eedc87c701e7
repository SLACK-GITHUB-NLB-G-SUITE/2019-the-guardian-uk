If you are the sort of person who cannot stop eating chocolate until the entire wrapper is redundant, and the evidence is all eaten, then smaller packages – controlled explosions – are sensible. This is where not supersizing is a bonus. Never be lured by special offers and buy only the smallest you can find to satisfy the yearn, and preferably just one small bar at a time. Because once you’ve breached the protocol of ripping open one small bar after another, there will be no stopping you. I like Willie’s Cacao (from £1.99) small bars for this, although at 50g they’re about as big as you should go and the milkiest low they hit is 44%, which may not be treat enough for you. Marks & Spencer and Waitrose both have teeny bars that can sate at 30-35g, and they come in all manner of worthiness. Pump Street excels here at 20g minis (£9.60 for four), but stockists are highly selective. Pounce when you see them. My new favourites, however, are more selective still (only via mail at the moment so pre-planning is necessary): Tosier’s 10g micro-batch tinies (£8 for four). I mean what is 10g of chocolate? Thus far only in 70% or 90% cocoa content (more coming though), the bars are exquisite Sylvanian Family-sized: two, sealed and dosage-controlled in a foil packet. But so flavoursome (the Monmouth Coffee Company version is the best coffee-chocolate I’ve ever tasted), even if you don’t usually like 70% chocolate I implore you to try them.
