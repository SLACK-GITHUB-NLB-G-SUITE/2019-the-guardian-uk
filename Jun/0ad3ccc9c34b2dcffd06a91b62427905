When Tim Halliday joined us in the biology department (as it was then called) at the Open University in 1977, he brought with him not only his love of all things amphibian but also a passionate commitment to teaching. His courses introduced thousands of OU students, many tackling science for the first time, to current thinking in evolution, animal behaviour and ecology, combining rigorous thinking with accessibility â€“ a rare skill.
