The Golden State Warriors will take the floor once more without two-time reigning NBA finals MVP Kevin Durant, counting on their depth and home court to carry them as they try to inch closer to a fourth title in five years. Durant is out for Game 3 of the finals on Wednesday night, still not ready to return for the defending champions as he works back from a calf-strain suffered during the Western Conference semi-finals. Durant didn’t practice with the Warriors on Tuesday, and he has yet to get on the court for a structured session since sustaining the injury in early May. Meanwhile, another of the team’s All-Stars, Klay Thompson, was on court for practice on Tuesday two days after he was forced out of Game 2 with a hamstring strain. He is listed as questionable for Game 3. “The pain level [on Tuesday] wasn’t too crazy at all. It will be a game-time decision. But for me personally, it would be hard to see me not playing. Hopefully, I’ll feel much better tomorrow and be a go for tipoff,” Thompson said. Along with Durant, Golden State are also down back-up big man Kevon Looney. He suffered an injury to his collarbone area and will miss the remainder of the finals. “He’s had such a great season, such a great postseason run,” coach Steve Kerr said. “Fortunately it won’t affect his future, but it’s a big loss for us.” The Warriors’ opponents, the Toronto Raptors, have fewer injury concerns although their star player, Kawhi Leonard, has occasionally limped during the series. On Tuesday, he said he was unconcerned. “A hundred percent,” Leonard said of his health. “I’m on the floor. There are no excuses. Everybody knows everyone’s banged up, bruised up at this moment.” Leonard is averaging 30.9 points this postseason. The best-of seven series is tied at 1-1 going into Game 3.
