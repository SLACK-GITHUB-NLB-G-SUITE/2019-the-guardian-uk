Those who got the fancy prices about Gibbs Hill for this Northumberland Plate can feel very smug, but following them in at 4-1 hardly appeals, as he hasn’t raced for almost two years and steps up in distance by half a mile. A BB∫Bbetter way to go at double-figure odds could be Speedo Boy (3.35), trained by Ian Williams, who knows how to win a major handicap. The chestnut was second in a hot race at Newmarket when last seen, five places ahead of a stablemate who then won at Royal Ascot. This surface is an unknown but he won his maiden on Polytrack in 2017 and is handicapped to go close if he takes to Tapeta. 1.50 Newcastle It’s interesting to see Andrea Atzeni booked for the course specialist Nick Vedder, who has never yet been out of the first three in 10 runs here. On his most recent visit, in January, he made an impressive late charge for the lead and is only 3lb higher now. The market is more interested in Air Raid, Cosmic Law and Dalton, none of whom has yet won on an artificial surface. 2.05 Newmarket It was only a four-runner race on soft that Summer Romance won on her debut at Yarmouth a fortnight ago but she looked classy and the runner-up has won since. A daughter of Kingman, she is a half-sister to a Queen Mary winner. 2.25 Newcastle Royal Ascot was a deflating experience for James Tate but his Invincible Army put up a fair effort in the Diamond Jubilee and this Chipchase Stakes is nothing like as fearsome. His only previous all-weather start was a Group Three success at Kempton. 2.45 York It’s easy to make excuses for Paddy Power’s third of seven at Salisbury last time, when he was short of room at a vital stage and found the step back to five furlongs against him. He had won two of his previous three and was first home on the wrong side on the other occasion, so he has to be of interest now that he returns to six furlongs, fast ground and a big field. That combination of circumstances got him the best win of his career at this track last June. 3.00 Newcastle Charlie Fellowes has been on a fine run since his first Royal Ascot success and, at one stage this week, had had four winners from his last six runners. His Carnwennan has improved steadily since being stepped up to two miles. 3.15 Newmarket This is a good opportunity for Glorious Journey, who chased home Dream Of Dreams at Windsor, form that now looks really hot. But it is surprising to see him as favourite, given that he has one win to show for his last eight starts, and Limato appeals more. Fast ground and seven furlongs is a good combination for him and he is up to giving the 5lb away to these rivals. 5.20 Curragh It was a bunched finish to the Derby but the form may work out in the Irish equivalent, televised on RTE and Racing TV, which can fall to Anthony Van Dyck. His finishing kick to seal that victory in the final furlong made him a worthy winner and he may again be too good for Madhmoon and Broome, with Rakan an outside contender for a place.
