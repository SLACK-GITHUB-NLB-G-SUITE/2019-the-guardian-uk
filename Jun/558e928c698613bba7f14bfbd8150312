The threat of war with Iran is terrifying and the behaviour of the US government risks making the danger real. Its categoric claim that Iran was responsible for last week’s attacks on the two tankers in the Straits of Hormuz has been challenged by the Japanese and the German governments. It has served only to make a dangerous situation more serious. The context to this is Donald Trump’s scrapping of the nuclear deal with Iran last year, which blocked the way to normalising relations and immediately escalated tension. The accompanying sanctions have caused real economic damage and human suffering. In May the Trump administration turned the screw tighter by dropping exemptions for oil exports. These measures are part of the policy of regime change advocated by John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, Trump’s two senior foreign policy officials, both of whom have called for military attacks on Iran. Rather than falling in line with the Trump administration’s dangerous brinkmanship, the British government should be calling for restraint and de-escalation and explicitly ruling out military options.Mark Rylance ActorBrian Eno MusicianRowan Williams Former Archbishop of CanterburyMiriam Margolyes ActorFrancesca Martinez Comedian and writerLindsey German Convenor, Stop the War CoalitionMurad Qureshi Chair, Stop the War CoalitionKate Hudson General Secretary, CNDBruce Kent Vice-president, CNDMarsha de Cordova MPEmma Dent Coad MPImran Hussain MPGrahame Morris MPIan Mearns MPKate Osamor MPLaura Pidcock MPLaura Smith MPMark Serwotka General secretary, PCSKevin Courtney General secretary, NEUAndrew Murray Chief of staff, UniteAbbas Edalat Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in IranMohammed Kozbar Muslim Association of BritainAaron Bastani Novara MediaSalma Yaqoob CampaignerYusuf (Cat Stevens) MusicianDavid Edgar PlaywrightKen Livingstone Former London mayorSami Ramadani Writer and academicPeter Oborne JournalistSteve Ashley SingerMatthew Willgress Stand Up to Trump • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
