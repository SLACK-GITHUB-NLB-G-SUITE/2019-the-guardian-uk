The London phase of filming for the new James Bond movie has begun. The film, not yet titled, has been shooting in Jamaica and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The official 007 Twitter account said on Sunday the spy movie was now on location in the capital. A photograph showed a clapperboard, marked B25 and Sunday’s date, in front of a mounted horse guard procession. It was captioned: “#Bond25 on location in London.” #Bond25 on location in London. pic.twitter.com/P0C7UoVQjf The cast of the 25th Bond film produced by Eon was announced in Jamaica in April, with Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas joining the line-up. A video of filming was shared last week, showing Daniel Craig driving an open-top 4x4 and bumping into women on the dancefloor of a nightclub. The movie, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, has faced problems in recent weeks, with a “controlled explosion” damaging the outside of the 007 Stage at Pinewood, leaving a crew member injured. No one working inside the studio was hurt, but one crew member outside sustained a minor injury. In May, Craig had minor ankle surgery after being injured while filming in Jamaica. The cast appeared in good spirits when Prince Charles visited them on set on 20 June.
