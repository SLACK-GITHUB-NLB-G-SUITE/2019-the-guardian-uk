Two suicide bombers have blown themselves up in separate attacks on police in Tunis, killing one officer and wounding several other people, the government has said. It was not immediately known who was behind the attacks in the Tunisian capital on Thursday. They happened months before an election and at the peak of a tourist season in which Tunisia is hoping for a record number of visitors. The first targeted a police patrol on Charles de Gaulle Street in central Tunis. One officer was killed and at least one other officer and three civilians were wounded, the interior ministry said. Shortly afterwards, a second suicide bomber blew himself up near a police station in al-Qarjani district. Four people were wounded, the interior ministry said. Heavily armed police sealed off the areas where the attacks took place. Tunisia has been battling militant groups operating in remote areas near the border with Algeria since an uprising overthrew the autocratic leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. High unemployment has also stoked unrest in recent years. In October, a woman blew herself up in the centre of Tunis, injuring 15 people including 10 police officers. That explosion broke a period of calm after dozens died in militant attacks in 2015. Security has improved since authorities imposed a state of emergency in November 2015 after those attacks â€“ one at a museum in Tunis and another on a beach in Sousse. A third attack targeted presidential guards in the capital and killed 12. Islamic State claimed responsibility. Those attacks scared off holidaymakers and investors, worsening an economic crisis.
