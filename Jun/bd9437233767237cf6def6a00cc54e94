We had an Ikea kitchen installed in March 2014 carrying a 25-year guarantee. Some of the MDF doors started to expand along the same moulded edge and need to be replaced. The rest of the units are unmarked. We first noticed one door in December last year and reported it. We had the obligatory visit from Ecomaster and its report evidently considered it to be a manufacturing defect. Other doors have developed the same problem but, in a subsequent report by the same technician, it has apparently been put down to “wear and tear”. An experienced local builder/joiner believes the problem is due to insufficient paint. As far as I can see, the Ikea guarantee is next to worthless. MH, Bangor As you say, Ikea offers a 25-year guarantee that covers defects in the material and workmanship on its Metod kitchen system, although we have reported numerous cases where readers struggled to get replacements. Since our intervention, all your faulty doors have been replaced. Ikea says: “We naturally want all our customers to be happy with the service they receive, and we have since been in direct contact with MH to resolve this matter to his satisfaction.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
