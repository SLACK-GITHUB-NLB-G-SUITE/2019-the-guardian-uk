Donâ€™t throw out the leftovers from your barbecue or beef wellington, when you can easily turn them into homemade jerky. Serves 2Marinate 4-12 hrsPrep 10 minsCook 4 hrs 250g beef trimmings/scraps 2 tbsp teriyaki sauce 3 slices ginger1 tsp dried chilli flakes 2 spring onion ends, squashed Place the beef scraps in a ziplock back along with the remaining ingredients. Close the bag and shake to evenly distribute the flavour. Leave to marinate for 4-12 hours in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 120C and line a baking tray with baking paper. Pat down the beef with kitchen paper to remove any excess liquid. Lay the marinated beef on the lined baking tray, then place it in the oven to dehydrate for 3-4 hours. Check intermittently. The jerky is ready when it bends and cracks as opposed to breaks in half. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
