Police have arrested 10 people over two murders that occurred only minutes apart in London on Friday afternoon. One man was stabbed to death in the street in Wandsworth in south-west London shortly before 4.45pm, while another man was shot dead in Greenwich, south-east London, at about 5pm. Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, expressed his disgust and said the Metropolitan police was working at its limit. “I am sickened to hear that two young lives have been ended within minutes of each other … Our overstretched police are working around the clock to keep Londoners safe. They need our support to end this scourge of violence.” Scotland Yard said residents in both areas could expect to see a heightened police presence in the coming days as detectives from the Met’s homicide and major crime command investigate. Both of the victims were male and thought to be in their late teens, though neither has yet been named. Officers said postmortems will be carried out soon and that they were in the process of informing the victims’ next of kin. They have not linked the two cases. Armed police responded to the incident in south-east London and, on Friday evening, Scotland Yard said three men and a woman had been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to separate south London police stations for questioning. Officers said they had arrested six males in the Wandsworth case and taken them for questioning. In April, it emerged that homicides across England and Wales were at a record high for the past decade, with a third of various knife offences being recorded in London. Nationally, instances of knife crimes had increased by 6% in 2018 on the previous year and the Office for National Statistics said the use of bladed weapons was concentrated in urban areas, though there were some signs the increase was slowing. The ONS also said there had been a 2% increase in the same period in instances of firearm offences.
