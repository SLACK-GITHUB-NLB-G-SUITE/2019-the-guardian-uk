Irish racing has been quite innovative with the scheduling of some of its biggest events in recent years, including decisions to stage the first four days at Punchestown, the Irish Derby and the Champion Stakes as early-evening fixtures in an attempt to maximise the TV audience. Running one of its 13 Group One events at 5.25 on a Friday evening is a fresh departure, though, and it will be interesting to see whether the viewing figures for the Pretty Polly Stakes on Friday make up for what would could well be a significant hit to the attendance at the track. In recent years, the Pretty Polly Stakes has been the feature event on the third and final day of the Derby meeting – on a Sunday. This year, though, the meeting has switched to a Thursday-to-Saturday schedule, building towards the Irish Derby as the climax of the final day rather than having it as the meat in the sandwich on day two. There is logic to that, as Irish racing wants to give as much of a lift to its premier Classic as possible following two years when the attendance – and the facilities for those who did get past the door – were limited by building work, during a €81m [£71.7m] redevelopment of the entire course. But it has also meant moving the Pretty Polly onto the Friday card which should, in theory, allow punters to apply the Punchestown principle and do a half-day at work before heading for the track. However, anyone who has experienced either the Friday rush-hour on Dublin’s ring road or the current extensive roadworks on the M7 to County Kildare will scarcely have time to grab a coffee and send a couple of emails if they want to be sure of making the first race at 3.15. There will be similar issues on Saturday when the Irish Derby faces a direct clash with a big Gaelic football game due to start in nearby Newbridge at 5pm, just a quarter of an hour before the Derby itself. All in all, it could turn out to be quite a challenging weekend for Irish racing, just when it would have hoped for the smoothest possible run at the first Irish Derby meeting in front of its gleaming new grandstand.There is no quibbling with the quality of Friday’s field, though, in an inter-generational clash featuring Pink Dogwood, the narrow runner-up in the Oaks at Epsom earlier this month, and Charlie Appleby’s four-year-old Wild Illusion, already a Group One winner at two and three. The tough Magic Wand and Dave Lanigan’s up-and-coming Worth Waiting, with Frankie Dettori in the saddle, add further depth. Wild Illusion (5.25) was a little disappointing on the face of it when she returned to action in the Prix D’Ispahan last time but she was quite fresh after a seven-month break and treated tenderly by James Doyle when it was clear that her chance had gone. She is worth a bet at around 2-1 to return to her best, and register a sixth Pretty Polly success for a British stable in the last eight years. On Friday’s British cards, Aweedram (4.10) will take plenty of beating at Yarmouth as he attempts to atone for his misbehaviour at Royal Ascot last week, when he got loose before the Britannia Stakes and was subsequently withdrawn. Tarboosh (6.35) and Elixsoft (7.40) are both fairly priced on the evening card at Newcastle, while Fox Leicester (3.50) and Prejudice (9.00) have strong claims at Doncaster and Newmarket respectively.
