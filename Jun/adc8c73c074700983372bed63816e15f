Prosecutors investigating the French actor Gérard Depardieu over allegations that he raped a young actress have closed the case due to lack of evidence, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday. “A number of investigations undertaken as part of this procedure have not enabled us to characterise the crimes alleged in all of their individual parts,” the prosecutor’s office said. Depardieu, star of The Last Metro and the Asterix and Obelix films, was accused of raping and assaulting an actress at his mansion in the French capital’s 6th district between 7 and 13 August 2018. Depardieu denied the accusations. The allegations came after scandals involving prominent men following rape and assault claims levelled against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and the ensuing #MeToo movement.
