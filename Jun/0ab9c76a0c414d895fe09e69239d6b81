The world’s oldest Sunday newspaper has been commissioning photography for 70 years. Selected by the Observer’s picture editor, this series shines a light on the work of often unheralded press photographers. The series covers people and events both fresh in the mind and long forgotten, from a time before pixels and instant access. Sign up and each week we’ll send you stunning images from our picture library, together with the original text, and enjoy discovering the art of the newspaper photographer.
