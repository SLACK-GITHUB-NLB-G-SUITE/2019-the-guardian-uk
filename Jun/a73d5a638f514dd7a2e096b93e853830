A man has been arrested after a crew member was stabbed at a film studio celebrated as the home base for the successful Harry Potter film series. Hertfordshire police said: “Police were called at around 12.35pm [on Wednesday] to reports of an incident at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden. One man sustained a neck injury and was taken to hospital by ambulance. A second man was arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and is currently in police custody. “It is believed the men are known to each other. Enquiries are continuing at this time to establish the circumstances around what happened.” The incident occurred during production of the new adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, starring Anne Hathaway. Warner Bros also issued a statement, saying: “[We] can confirm that there was an isolated workplace incident at the Warner Bros studio production facility and the police are now handling the matter.” Leavesden is also the location for the popular Making of Harry Potter studio tour, which is open as normal.
