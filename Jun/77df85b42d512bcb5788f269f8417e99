Aston Villa will complete the signing of Anwar El Ghazi from Lille in the next 24 hours after triggering the option to buy the 24-year-old winger following his successful loan last season. Villa agreed a fee when El Ghazi joined on loan last August – understood to be £8m. El Ghazi scored six goals for Villa last season, including the first in the 2-1 Championship play-off final victory over Derby. He also had a hand in the second goal at Wembley and said after the game that he hoped to extend his stay and play for the club in the Premier League. The former Ajax player will be Villa’s second signing of the summer, following the arrival of the 27-year-old Spanish attacker Jota from rivals Birmingham City on Wednesday. Plenty more new faces are anticipated, given the challenge of returning to the Premier League and the fact that eight players were released on Saturday. Villa remain keen to complete a deal for Tyrone Mings, who was outstanding during his loan from Bournemouth. There was no fee written into that loan deal – a decision made at the Bournemouth end – and the player’s asking price will have been driven up by his performances for Villa.
