Dozens of MPs will be visiting childcare providers in their constituency on Friday as part of a week of action where providers and parents have called on the government to address the early years funding shortfall, which is now over two-thirds of a billion pounds. MPs will see a sector close to breaking point. The number of childcare providers fell by almost 10,000 in the last two years. Around half of all “free” childcare places come with voluntary charges, while many providers have been forced to choose between higher parent fees or closing their doors – a situation that hits disabled children and poorer families hardest. This wasn’t the intention of government policy but it is the direct result. The case has been made in every constituency and at every level: it is now up to the government to respond and ensure that funding matches the true cost of delivering quality childcare.Neil Leitch Chief executive, Early Years Alliance, Purnima Tanuku Chief executive, NDNA (National Day Nurseries Association), Liz Bayram Chief executive, Pacey (Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years), June O’Sullivan Chief executive, LEYF (London Early Years Foundation), Dr Jan Georgeson Chair, Association for Professional Development in Early Years (Tactyc) • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
