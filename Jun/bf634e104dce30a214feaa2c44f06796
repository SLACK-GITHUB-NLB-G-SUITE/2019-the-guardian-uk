Kevin Durant practiced on Monday morning but the Golden State Warriors will wait before deciding if he plays in Game 5 of the NBA finals. The Warriors are listing Durant, who has been sidelined for more than a month with a strained calf, as a “game-time decision” for Game 5 although ESPN reported that the 30-year-old intends to play. The Warriors trail the Toronto Raptors 3-1 in the best-of-seven series, meaning their quest for a third consecutive NBA championship could end on Monday. Durant spent about 25 minutes on court before leaving toward the end of the session. “He went through full shootaround and went back to get treatment,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We’ll list him game-time decision, but it looked good and we’ll see where it all goes.” Durant did not say anything as he walked past reporters to get to the Warriors’ locker room. He was cleared by the Warriors’ medical staff after Thursday’s Game 4 and practiced with the team on Sunday for the first time since his injury. He averaged 26.0 points per game for the Warriors during the regular season and 34.2 points in 11 playoff games before he got hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston. Kerr was asked if he had any reservations about Durant’s ability if he is ultimately cleared to play. “You worry about the conditioning,” Kerr said. “The skill, obviously, is undeniable and he’s a guy who can get a shot off anytime he wants. He’s been in similar situations with us where he’s had long layoffs. He’s Kevin Durant. If we have him out there, he’ll be a threat. We know that.” Durant was the NBA finals MVP when Golden State captured titles in 2017 and 2018. He has missed Golden State’s last nine games; the Warriors are 6-3 in those contests.
