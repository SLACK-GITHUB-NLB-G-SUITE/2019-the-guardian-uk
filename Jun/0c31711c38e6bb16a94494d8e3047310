Jeremy Noseda, who saddled the winners of the St Leger and the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile during more than two decades with a licence, said on Thursday that he will retire from training “with a smile on my face and with a lot of great memories” having decided that “the time is right to walk away” from racing. Noseda started his career as an assistant to both John Gosden and John Dunlop before playing a key role behind the scenes in the early years of Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin racing operation. He set up as a trainer in his own right at Shalfleet Stables in Newmarket in 1998 and joined the ranks of the Classic-winners in 2006 when Sixties Icon took the St Leger. That success helped to boost Noseda’s seasonal prize money total to seven figures for the first time and he also reached at least £1m in the following three seasons without ever bettering his return of £1.26m in 2006. I have decided to retire from training. The time is right for me to walk away. I will be leaving the sport with a smile on my face and with a lot ofgreat memories. Noseda is also one of the few European trainers to send out a Breeders’ Cup winner on dirt thanks to Wilko’s victory in the Juvenile at Lone Star Park in Texas in 2004. He also saddled nine winners at Royal Ascot including two at Group One level – Soldier’s Tale in the 2007 Diamond Jubilee Stakes and Arafaa in the St James’s Palace Stakes a year earlier – while his achievement in preparing Laddies Poker Two to land a big gamble in the Wokingham Handicap in 2010 after a 610-day break was arguably the finest of his career. “I have been lucky enough to enjoy many fabulous days as a trainer and also earlier in my career,” Noseda said on Thursday. “I would like to thank my owners for their support over the last 20 years and, in particular, I would like to thank my staff for all of their highly skilled work and dedication.

Several worked with me at Godolphin and then for me in Newmarket. Indeed, there are those who I would count as very good friends. I know that they are among the very best staff in Newmarket and will have no trouble finding good positions within other stables.” The number of runners saddled by Noseda has declined steadily since the 2009 season, when he sent out 61 winners from 334 starters in Britain. In 2018, he had 19 winners from 97 runners, while in the current season, Noseda has saddled four winners from just 32 runners, including two victories at York’s high-profile Dante meeting last month. He suffered a significant setback in May 2018 when Phoenix Thoroughbreds, a major buyer at the yearling sales in recent seasons, removed 14 horses from his stable. Noseda said at the time that he was “shocked and surprised” by the decision and had “received no reason or explanation” for it. “I have no immediate plans for the future,” Noseda said, “except for the fact that I will be taking a two-week summer holiday with my sons, Richard and James. It will be the first time I have enjoyed a proper summer holiday with them and I’m really looking forward to that.” Calyx has been ruled out of the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot after sustaining a pastern injury. John Gosden’s charge was unbeaten in two starts in a curtailed juvenile campaign, but shot to the head of the betting for the Group One feature after making an impressive return at Ascot at the beginning of May. However, the three-year-old then suffered a shock reverse when only second at odds of 2-13 in the Sandy Lane Stakes at Haydock and it has transpired the Kingman colt sustained an injury in that race last month. Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for owner Khalid Abdullah, said in a statement: “Following his run in the Sandy Lane Stakes, it has been revealed that Calyx sustained a pastern injury which is now being investigated. This will rule him out of the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot, but we are hopeful that he could run again in the latter half of the season.” PA
