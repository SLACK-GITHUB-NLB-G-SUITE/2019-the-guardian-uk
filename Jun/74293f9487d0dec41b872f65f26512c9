David Silva has laid out his intentions to leave Manchester City at the end of next season. The 33-year-old, who has amassed 395 appearances for the club, says the 2019-20 campaign will be his last in Manchester. Silva, who has won four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and four League Cups during his time at City, featured in 33 league games last season as Pep Guardiola’s side retained their crown as part of a domestic treble. The Spain midfielder, who has also lifted two European Championships and the World Cup with his country, moved to City from Valencia in June 2010. But at a press conference in Gran Canaria he said reaching a decade is the right time to call it a day. “This is the last one,” he said. “Ten years for me is enough. It’s the perfect time for me. Initially, City were talking about two [more] years. “It completes the cycle. It’s a nice round figure. I can never see myself playing against City for another team. So 10 years – that’s it.”
