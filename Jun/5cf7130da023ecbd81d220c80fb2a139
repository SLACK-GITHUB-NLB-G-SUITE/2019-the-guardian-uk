You might know a great campsite close to a station, a scenic branch line or a neat (legit) way of avoiding paying a supplement and not losing out on the best route. Perhaps you’ve come across ways of booking a sleeping berth or know which stations offer good showers. We also want to hear about any good anecdotes you might have from your Interrail trips. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 18 June 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here. Read the terms and conditions.
