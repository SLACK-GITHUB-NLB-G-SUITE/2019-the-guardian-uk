An international field assembles for the big race on Royal Ascot’s closing card, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, in which Blue Point tries to add to his victory here on Tuesday. The French raider City Light and Bound From Nowhere, from the US, are to be feared, while other contenders have also travelled from Singapore and New Zealand. But all may struggle to match a horse whose home is just two hours up the road at Newmarket. The Tin Man (4.20) took this prize in 2017 and was a marginally unlucky fourth last year. He also won here on Champions Day in 2016 and bagged the third Group One of his career at Haydock last autumn. He should be a lot sharper for his first run back at Windsor, when he was giving weight to the first two, and looks the value in the race at 9-1. 2.30 Chesham Stakes Lope Y Fernandez has obvious claims on his debut win but Aidan O’Brien’s second-string might be a better option and not for the first time this week. Year Of The Tiger ran a promising race in second the same day, looking as though this step up in trip was needed, and his pedigree promises much. 3.05 Jersey Stakes There’s a lot to like about the zippy Space Blues but he does not deserve to be half the price of So Perfect. O’Brien’s filly was beaten less than a length in the Queen Mary last year and later came within half a length of a Group One win against males. Having needed her first run back, she powered home at Naas last time. 3.40 Hardwicke Stakes He was impressive in last year’s Derby but there’s no way Masar can be the right favourite for this after a year off with a leg injury. Defoe appeals more, as a Group One winner last time who nonetheless meets these rivals at level weights. 5.00 Wokingham Stakes For a horse with a fair record at this track, it’s surprising to see Spring Loaded available at 25-1. Paul D’Arcy’s veteran was an unlucky ninth in this last year on his first run of the season and beat 19 rivals to a big pot here next time out. Just 4lb higher now and sharper for a Listed-race run at Windsor, he could get involved under his claiming rider. 5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes Willie Mullins knows how to win this and reports are encouraging about his Max Dynamite, though the nine-year-old has not been the most reliable. A chance is taken on Younevercall, whose hurdling exploits suggest he might be good enough to beat these on his Flat-racing debut.
