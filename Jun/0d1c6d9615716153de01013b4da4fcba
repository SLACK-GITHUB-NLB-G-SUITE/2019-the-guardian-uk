Hovis is bringing its much-loved “boy on the bike” television advert back, nearly 50 years after it was last seen. The short film will be shown on ITV on Monday evening. Sir Ridley Scott, who launched his directing career with the original advert, has remastered it in conjunction with the British Film Institute national archive. The advert first aired in 1973 and shows a young boy pushing a bike loaded with bread up a cobbled hill. Hovis said it hopes to introduce the advert to a new generation who still appreciate its “core message of hard work, family and the strength of community”. The advert has undergone a 4K digital restoration, and its score of Dvorak’s New World Symphony has been re-recorded by a new generation of the original Ashington Colliery brass band. In April, a survey of 1,200 consumers voted the advert the UK’s most “heartwarming and iconic advert”. Jeremy Gibson, marketing director at Hovis, said: “The values of our brand have never been more relevant, so we decided to remaster and relaunch our ‘boy on the bike’ advert. “Despite being over 46 years old, recent research has found that the advert is as good today as it’s always been and differs from adverts focusing on broader entertainment. “We are seeing a mass movement across the country celebrating craftsmanship, traditional products and UK produce, and this advert is one of the most iconic examples of a brand celebrating the ties that bind us as communities and as a country, drawing on tradition but informing our future.” Scott said: “I’m thrilled that the ‘boy on the bike’ is still regarded as such an iconic and heartwarming story which remains close to the heart of the nation. “I remember the filming process like it was yesterday, and its success represents the power of the advert.”
