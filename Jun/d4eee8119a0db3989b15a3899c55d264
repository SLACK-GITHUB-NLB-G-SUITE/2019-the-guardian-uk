Ashleigh Barty has described turning down Andy Murray’s request for her to be his partner in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon as the hardest decision she has had to make. Murray revealed on Thursday that the French Open champion was one of the players he had approached partnering him at Wimbledon but she rejected the opportunity. Barty will be a contender for the singles title in SW19 having lifted her maiden grand slam title at the French Open and the Australian is playing in the women’s doubles, where she is also a major winner, with Victoria Azarenka. After beating Venus Williams 6-4, 6-3 to reach the semi-finals of the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham, Barty said: “When Andy texted me asking me to play, I was a little bit shocked. Obviously I would have loved to have grabbed the opportunity to play with Andy, and I think it was the hardest decision I have ever had to make as to whether I’m playing an event or not. “I took some time to think about it, and playing three events is just a little bit too much. When a champion asks you to play at any stage, I was very flattered and honoured, and I said to him: ‘I think there are some pretty good options out there for you.’ I’m sure he’ll find someone.” Barty is the form player in tennis at the moment and made a seamless transition from clay to grass. She trailed Williams 4-1 in the opening set but won five games in a row and, having made it 10 victories in succession, is now only two wins away from overtaking Naomi Osaka as the world No 1. Barty insisted she is not focusing on that, saying: “If world No 1 happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. It’s not something I’m stressed about.” Barty now takes on Barbora Strycova, who defeated Kristyna Pliskova 6-2, 6-4. The other semi-final will pit Julia Görges, who knocked out Yulia Putintseva 6-3, 6-2, against the unseeded Petra Martic, who beat Jelena Ostapenko 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-1.
