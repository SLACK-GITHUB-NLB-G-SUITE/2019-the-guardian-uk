The US Federal Aviation Administration has banned all US airlines and aircraft from flying in Iranian airspace close to where the US drone was shot down due to “heightened military activities”, as tensions increase in the region. The FAA issued an emergency order saying ALL FLIGHT OPERATIONS IN THE OVERWATER AREA OF THE TEHRAN FLIGHT INFORMATION REGION (FIR) (OIIX) ABOVE THE PERSIAN GULF AND GULF OF OMAN ONLY ARE PROHIBITED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE DUE TO HEIGHTENED MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND INCREASED POLITICAL TENSIONS IN THE REGION, WHICH PRESENT AN INADVERTENT RISK TO U.S. CIVIL AVIATION OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL FOR MISCALCULATION OR MIS-IDENTIFICATION. DUE TO HEIGHTENED MILITARY ACTIVITIES United Airlines has suspended flights from New Jersey’s Newark airport to Mumbai until further notice after Iran shot down a high-altitude US surveillance drone. The downing on Wednesday of the unarmed Global Hawk aircraft, which can fly at altitudes of up to 60,000ft, was the latest of a series of incidents that have raised tensions in the Gulf region, a critical artery for global oil supplies. Earlier, a total of six oil tankers were damaged in two separate attacks. Donald Trump has suggested the attack on the drone could have been carried out by a “loose and stupid” Iranian officer without authorisation from Tehran. United said on its website: “Given current events in Iran, we have conducted a thorough safety and security review of our India service through Iranian airspace and decided to suspend our service.” The airline said it would rebook customers who planned to fly to Mumbai. United has another route to India, from Newark to Delhi, but this has also been suspended because Pakistan has closed some of its airspace. Flight tracking data showed commercial aircraft flying close to the Global Hawk drone at the time it was shot down, said OPS Group, which provides safety guidance to air operators. “The threat of a civil aircraft shootdown in southern Iran is real,” it advised operators on Thursday. “Avoiding the Strait of Hormuz area is recommended – misidentification of aircraft is possible.” Here is our high-res map of the Civil Air Traffic picture at 2335Z last night, showing the risk to aircraft operators in the region. #opsgroup #flightplanning #IranUSTension #StraitofHormuz #drone #missile #iran #GulfOfOman pic.twitter.com/FfhGhdsKvr Last month, US regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advised airlines to exercise caution in flying over Iran and nearby areas, due to heightened military activities and increased political tension. It said: “Although Iran likely has no intention to target civil aircraft, the presence of multiple long-range, advanced anti-aircraft capable weapons in a tense environment poses a possible risk of miscalculation or misidentification, especially during periods of heightened political tension and rhetoric.” In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, prompting carriers to take more steps to uncover potential threats to their planes.
