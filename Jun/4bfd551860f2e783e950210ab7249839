We are writing to lend our support to Niamh Eastwood, executive director of Release – the UK centre of expertise on drugs and drug laws – following the Home Office barring her from the government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) (Drugs expert barred from policy panel after criticising Home Office, 11 June). The ACMD acts as an independent advisory board to the Home Office, whose proper functioning relies on the participation of the UK’s leading experts. The Home Office’s decision to screen candidates based on “relevant social media content” (and beyond to unrelated content including Brexit and Windrush) is a worrying act of political interference in an impartial and apolitical body. The UK is experiencing levels of avoidable drug-related deaths not seen for decades, constituting a third of all drug-related deaths in Europe. That Eastwood simultaneously supported the ACMD’s findings on the need to implement drug consumption rooms and criticised the Home Office’s inaction on this issue does not constitute “lobbying”, or compromise her ability to provide unbiased advice to the government. Eastwood is one of the UK’s leading voices on evidence-based drug policies and harm reduction. The ACMD’s ability to provide the best available advice to the government, and the government’s ability to support its most vulnerable citizens, is made weaker by her absence. We strongly condemn this decision and invite the Home Office to reconsider.
