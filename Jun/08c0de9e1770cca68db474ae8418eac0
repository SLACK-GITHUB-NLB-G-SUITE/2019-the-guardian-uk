Wonderful seafood, a brilliant location, great value, an unusual building … there are many ingredients that make up a superb beach or seafront cafe or restaurant. Oyster shacks, smokeries, fresh crab stalls and traditional fish and chip restaurants could all be among your favourites. Michelin stars aren’t a necessary constituent of superb places to eat, but let’s not rule them out! Whether it’s a remote rural cafe above a secret inlet or a busy quality restaurant on a popular beach in or near a town, please feel free to share your experience. Please send us your tips from all parts of the UK, from Scottish sea lochs to Cornish bays, the Thames estuary to the wilder coasts of Wales and Northern Ireland. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
