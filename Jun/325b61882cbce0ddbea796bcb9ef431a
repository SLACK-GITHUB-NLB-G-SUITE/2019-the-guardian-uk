One of the greatest threats to free speech in Britain is the routine labelling, by the police, of non-violent protests and campaigns as “domestic extremism”. This term has no clear legal definition but is used to justify intensive surveillance and the retention of information on people who in many cases have never been arrested. Designating a campaign as extremist means everyone associated with it may also find themselves labelled in this way, even if they do nothing unlawful. From anti-fracking and anti-racist campaigners to peace and anti-nuclear groups, international solidarity activists and opponents of hunting, so many people who are legitimately protesting are also subjectively targeted by sweeping terrorism powers. This includes the draconian “counter-radicalisation” Prevent programme, which has been used to try to stifle the political views of young people, their parents and those who work with children and vulnerable adults. Categorising legitimate free speech and dissent as “domestic extremism” intimidates and alienates people from taking part in protest activities, restricting their ability to exercise their rights to freedom of assembly and association. This cannot continue. Already this year, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg has ruled that police acted unlawfully in compiling and retaining records about the political activities of campaigners John and Linda Catt on a “domestic extremism” database (Protester, 94, wins long battle to be deleted from police database, 25 January). It added that UK law in this area is too vague to provide adequate protection against the arbitrary use of police powers. We collectively support the demands of the Network for Police Monitoring’s “Protest Is Not Extremism” campaign, which calls on the police to stop categorising campaigning and protest activities as domestic extremism. We also seek a clear separation of protest policing from counter-terrorism and better protection for campaigners against surveillance, including independent oversight of how police use it in relation to political protest.
