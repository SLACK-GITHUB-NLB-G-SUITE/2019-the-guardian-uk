Marianne Vos won the second stage of the Women’s Tour after a dramatic finish at the Kent Cyclopark in Gravesend on Tuesday. The 32-year-old from the Netherlands, who won the Tour de Yorkshire last month, prevailed in a group sprint, with Lizzie Deignan finishing second. Sarah Roy was third, ahead of Elena Cecchini and Maria Giulia Confalonieri. Vos outsprinted her rivals to win by two metres and provisionally win the race leader’s green jersey. Trek-Segafredo put the hammer down at the front in a bid to secure victory for their rider Deignan but the powerful Vos edged her in a thrilling finish. Sam Bennett sprinted to a commanding victory on stage three of the Critérium du Dauphiné. The Irish rider took the 177km stage from Le Puy-en-Velay to Riom after some brilliant teamwork allowed him to break clear in the final 200m. Wout Van Aert came second in the sprint, with Davide Ballerini close behind in third. Dylan Teuns retained the yellow jersey and has a 3sec lead over Guillaume Martin in the general classification. Chris Froome and Adam Yates remain in the top 10.
