Jason Roy will be given until the last moment to prove his fitness for Sunday’s crucial World Cup match against India. The England opener is working his way back from a hamstring tear which has forced him to miss the games against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Australia, but is being assessed on a daily basis before the Edgbaston encounter. An ECB spokesman said: “Jason Roy is making good progress from his hamstring injury. He is being assessed every day. Yesterday he batted in the nets and was also running shuttles on the outfield. A decision on whether he’ll be fit to resume against India will be made when we train on Friday and Saturday at Edgbaston.” Roy is one of a series of fitness concerns with England facing a fight to make the semi-finals after back-to-back defeats by Sri Lanka and Australia. The leg-spinner Adil Rashid came into the tournament with a shoulder problem and reported soreness after Tuesday’s defeat by Australia, although he is not thought to be a doubt for the weekend. The spokesman said: “Adil Rashid has some soreness to his right shoulder. He will be assessed over the next few days but he is expected to be available for selection on Sunday.” England also have a concern over the fast bowler Jofra Archer, but the all-rounder Ben Stokes, who underwent treatment for a calf problem on the pitch at Lord’s, will be available. The spokesman continued: “Jofra Archer has tightness to his left side and will continue to be assessed ahead of the India match. Ben Stokes sustained tight calves in yesterday’s match. He will be fit for Sunday’s match. He felt better after the game.”
