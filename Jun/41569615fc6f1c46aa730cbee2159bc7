Travellers are being warned to expect delays on roads, rail, waterways and in the skies amid a day of wild weather, including snow falls in parts of New South Wales and Queensland and icy winds. A huge swell also forced the the cancellation of some Sydney ferry services on Tuesday, while major airlines have warned passengers to check the status of their flights. The Blue Mountains west of Sydney woke to a blanket of snow, while the Bureau of Meteorology said there had also been falls in Queensland’s Granite Belt region, west of Brisbane, but flakes were few and far between and it was not expected to settle. About 3cm on the ground now in my part of town. Another big chunk of convection heading approximately this way. Temperature now 0.1C and steady for the moment.

About five centimetres of snow settled on Katoomba, Blackheath and surrounding areas on Tuesday morning, as a burst of cold weather hits the state. “It’s enough to cause road issues and enough to fold the branches of the trees from the weight of the snow,” said the Bureau of Meteorology’s Jordan Notara. The ice and snow temporarily forced the closure of the Great Western Highway at Katoomba, Mount Victoria and Blackheath, as well as a section of the Bells Line of Road. Snow also affected several local roads in the Central Tablelands and Snowy Mountains, with falls recorded in Oberon, Lithgow, and Armidale in the state’s north. The arrival of a cold air mass about midnight caused temperatures to fall, and icy winds made it seem much colder. At Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, the temperature felt like -4.6C early on Tuesday morning, even though the official temperature was 3.1C. It was a similar situation in other southern inland communities, where the “feels like” temperature was at or slightly below zero. 4cm to 5cm cover in my yard in Blackheath now, as of 6:10 am, measured in half a dozen spots. Snow depths vary even over fairly short distances, just like showers of rain do. pic.twitter.com/ciPxfrLBs3 The bureau warned Sydney drivers to take care on roads as the city was battered by gale-force winds and heavy rain brought by a Tasman low and a cold front. The strong and gusty winds averaged 60km/h to 70km/h along the south coast, with peak gusts in excess of 90km/h, the Bureau of Meteorology said. In an updated severe weather warning spanning some 1,000km of NSW coastline, the bureau said “an intense Tasman low and associated cold front will produce a strong and gusty winds along parts of the coast today”. Mad morning commute from the blue mountains for me! #sydneyweather pic.twitter.com/JrROGDNZKN “These winds will whip up heavy surf conditions, making coastal activities dangerous, and bringing the potential for coastal erosion,” it warned. Qantas and Virgin Australia warned that the wild weather could impact flights and urged travellers to check with their airlines for updates. Ferries between Manly and Circular Quay had to be cancelled due to the large swell, with buses called in to replace services. Train commuters have also been told to allow extra travel time with delays to some services due to the wet weather conditions. So, this is the current situation on the Manly ferry. I'm getting seasick just from watching this... 🤢🌊 pic.twitter.com/DEphP57A9H NSW assistant police commissioner Michael Corboy said roads will be slippery and visibility poor, and stressed the need to go slow and follow directions. “It’s not just your life at risk – it’s the lives of the emergency service workers some of whom are volunteers,” he said in a statement. The bureau has issued a warning for those driving in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, with gusty winds expected to make conditions dangerous. “Motorists are advised to take extreme care,” it said. In Victoria, the bureau warned of damaging winds in East Gippsland and the north east of the state, averaging 60km/h to 70km/h, with peak gusts to 105 km/h. with agencies
