Danny Baker will return to broadcasting in the new year with a podcast version of his axed BBC Radio 5 Live show. The DJ, 61, who was sacked by the broadcaster in May over accusations of racism, said on Twitter that the podcast would be released twice-weekly and feature the same elements as his previous show. “My own standalone podcast, featuring all the old firm and even the Sausage Sandwich Game, will begin in the new year. Emails encouraged, calls taken, subjects bizarre. A twice-a-week meeting, we can rule the world,” he wrote.

Following widespread criticism, Baker deleted the tweet and said that he hadn’t recognised the racial connotations of the tweet because his mind was not “diseased”. The BBC cancelled Baker’s show soon after, with a Radio 5 Live spokesperson describing the tweet as going against “the values we as a station aim to embody”. The tweet was subsequently investigated by the Metropolitan police, which declined to take further action. Baker later issued a formal apology for the tweet, describing it as a “naive and catastrophic mistake”. Writing on Twitter, Baker said that he had altered his social-media habits in the wake of the controversy. “I only nip in [to Twitter] for half an hour a night now. Learned my lesson,” he said.
