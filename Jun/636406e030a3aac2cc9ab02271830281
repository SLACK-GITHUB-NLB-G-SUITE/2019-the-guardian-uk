When it comes to relationships, falling for someone you already know and like can, of course, be brilliant. The stumbling block is how to tell them, without ruining your friendship. We’d like to talk to people who have had this experience about how they negotiated the conversation. Did you wait a long time before telling your friend that you had romantic feelings for them? Did you brood over the details, or the likely outcome - and how did you approach the conversation with them? Did your revelation lead to romance - and if not, did you manage to maintain a great friendship? Tell us your stories in the form below. One of our journalists may contact you to find out more about your experience and we will feature some of the best responses. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
