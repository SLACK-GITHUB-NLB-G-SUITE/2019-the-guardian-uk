1) The Womenâ€™s World Cup is heating up, so letâ€™s have a look at some history. Hereâ€™s a documentary celebrating 50 years of the Donny Belles, trailblazers in the English game; a short film on womenâ€™s football during the first world war; a game between Handley Page Girls and Ladies Sterling Football Club in 1919; women footballers looking cool as you like in 1920; a bit from BBC Teach on the history of the womenâ€™s game; and the National Football Museum taking us through Englandâ€™s run at the unofficial World Cup in 1971. 2) The cricket World Cup is also getting there and England appear to have a chance. As such, here are some reminders of what happens when that happens: West Indies dealing with things in 1979; Australia dealing with things in 1987; and Wasim Akram dealing with things in 1992. Go carefully, people. 3) A World Cup â€™92 bonus: Jonty Rhodes channels Superman to run out Inzamam-ul-Haq. 4) Itâ€™s 27 years this week since Sweden knocked England out of Euro â€˜92. So hereâ€™s the goal that did it, elevated by the brilliance of Barry Davies, and while weâ€™re here, some more incredible commentary: the Radio Goal collection of amazing moments, originally a cassette given away free with Goal magazine; the late, great Sid Waddell and Dave Lanning narrate Phil Taylorâ€™s two nine-darters in the Premier League final of 2010; and Richie Benaudâ€™s final stint, on the final day of the 2005 Ashes series. 5) Nerves appeared to get to Ferland Mendy as he failed to impress with some attempted keepy-ups at his Real Madrid unveiling. He isnâ€™t the first to make a mess of his tricks and flicks when being presented by one of La Ligaâ€™s super-clubs. Comme Ferland Mendy, ils ont ratÃ© leurs jongles le jour de leur prÃ©sentation ðŸ‘‡ #Oups pic.twitter.com/cgBgpUSNBu 6) Cliff Thorburn and Alex Higgins did not like one another. Sadly, YouTube is silent on the violence, but here they are, arguing over a green ball, after which an affronted Thorburn refuses Higgins the use of his extension. 1) The top 10 goals of the 21st century (in someoneâ€™s opinion). 2) A rally car speeds down a country road, only to find another car coming the other way. Contains swearing in Slovenian. 3) Are corners pointless? 4) The top 10 goal from the Copa AmÃ©rica in 2011, 2015 and 2016. Spotters badges: LeeWall, YorkerBouncer, whobroughtoranges, denothemeno.
