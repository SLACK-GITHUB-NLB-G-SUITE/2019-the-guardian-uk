300ml, £1.50, marksandspencer.comThis tastes like the real deal. Sharp, sweet, fresh and juicy with nice bits of orange in there. It really tastes freshly squeezed. A clear favourite.★★★★ 1l, £2, asda.comThis is what you want from an orange juice – well-balanced sweetness and acidity. It tastes super fresh.★★★★ 1l, £2.95, food.coop.co.ukIt’s got nice bits in it and I like the sharpness but it’s not as balanced as some of the others. It’s refreshing but not particularly memorable.★★★ 1l, £2, tesco.comI’m not very into this one. It’s thinner than the others and doesn’t taste as freshly squeezed . There’s a lingering bitter aftertaste that I’m not keen on.★★ 100ml, £2, sainsburys.co.ukDelicate, there’s a slightly floral note - I think that’s the aloe. Not too sweet. Good kick from the ginger.★★★ 400g, £3.69, pret.co.ukLooks like pea soup. Good sharpness. Thick and creamy, but fresh, not claggy, definitely has some lime or lemon juice in it.★★ 750ml, £1.50, tesco.comSmells appealing, like it has something tropical going on … much sweeter than the others. Very hard to discern what fruits are in there … Kids will like it, but for me, too sweet.★★ 250g, £2.95, leon.coWow, this is so thick. You can’t really drink it, you have to take a mouthful. It could be fresher than the others? Reminds me of kiwi … which I’m not mad on. I don’t really love this, it’s pulpy.★★ 500g, £1.40, food.coop.co.ukOoh, this has a really good, lively mouth-puckering sharpness and a lovely freshness. It feels quite virtuous, but it’s also indulgent. Very nice.★★★★ 500ml, £1, marksandspencer.comFresh, smooth and creamy with an excitable tang. Could be great with a fruit compote or some raw honey stirred through - really solid breakfast building block.★★★★ 450g, £1.60, ocado.comVery creamy and smooth with a pleasant, subtle tang and a nice grassy lushness. Really well-balanced flavour.★★★★ 500g, £1.85, ocado.comI love the thickness and the freshness, but the texture is a little grainy and lumpy in places.★★★ 220g, £2.35, benugo.comThe blueberries look lovely. Nice consistency, creamy. The dried fruit inside is plump and the flavour well balanced. The warm spice and crunchy almonds place it at the top.★★★★ 200g, from £2.99, pret.co.ukGood sharpness. I like the mango-coconut combination. A little runny, needs a bit more grain. Not too sweet. Juicy mango.★★★ 160g, £2.35, costa.co.ukGood crunchy apple going through it. It’s got a pleasing sharpness, creamy too, good texture. I like the crunchy pumpkin seeds and sweet cranberries. Nicely balanced.★★★ 190g, £1.60, sainsburys.co.ukI like the pumpkin seeds. But the texture is not as creamy as the others, a bit gloopy.★★ 425g, £2.99, ocado.comReally crunchy, loads of seeds, nuts, flakes. Not sweet but tastes like there’s coconut oil in it. A lovely topping for poached fruit.★★★★ 500g, £2.50, tesco.comClusters, chunky bite-size pieces. Lovely whole nuts. You can really get your teeth into it. It just needs to be a couple of notches less sweet.★★★ 500g, £4.50, rudehealth.comThe oats and nuts are really nicely golden and toasted and there’s a subtle sweetness, but I think it could benefit from some dried fruit for contrast.★★★ 500g, £1.97, asda.comThe whole almonds and puffed grains are nice. Not as much fun as the others. Not overly sweet, nice toasted note to it. I think it would be good on yogurt.★★★ £2.50, pret.co.ukThe bun has a glossy sheen, buttery, slightly sweet. I’m disappointed how uncrispy the bacon is. But the taste is delicious and smoky. It’s a bit gourmet, I’d have to be in the mood.★★★ £2.95, costa.co.ukWith the crunchy bun and crunchy bacon, it’s in danger of being dry – needs sauce. A good bog-standard bacon roll.★★★ £3.25, caffenero.comThe roll is nice and crusty and there is plenty of bacon, but it lacks flavour and is slightly sweet, which I don’t love. I wouldn’t rush to eat it again.★★ £3.15, starbucks.comThe bun lid is very solid, I can practically play it on my plate. No butter on it either or any fat from the bacon. I’m struggling to taste the bacon … very little flavour.★
