Please will you give urgent, more prominent coverage to the appalling suffering described alongside your Eyewitness photo (Extreme drought in India forces evacuation of villages, 13 June), not only because of the immediate disaster, surely due to global warming, but also because of its scale.

Australia?Norah WagonDrayton, Somerset • In response to Zoe Williams (Hell is someone else’s kitchen, G2, 13 June), for years we have carried what we call our “gite box” on all self-catering holidays. It contains everything we may need such as a sharp knife, frying pan and spatula, bottle opener, coffee filter, dishcloth, rubber gloves, etc, so we are not totally dependent on the strange kitchen.Joanna MoodyPateley Bridge, North Yorkshire • Over its first five weeks Russell T Davies’ Years and Years on BBC One has moved from dystopian fiction to self-help manual for the imminent future.

My mum’s adage, “A house should be clean enough to be healthy and dirty enough to be happy”, seems to work well enough.Jacqueline WilksWinchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
