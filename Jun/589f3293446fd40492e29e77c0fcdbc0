I am a 38-year-old woman and have been with my boyfriend, 32, for two years. I’ve swung between thinking we should break up, and convincing myself we can make it work and that my gut feeling of uncertainty stems from my own issues. While we have our problems, we are willing to work through them, and he is by far the best partner I have had in many ways. There is no reason to believe that we can’t overcome our difficulties (except perhaps that we haven’t yet, despite counselling), so I don’t know why I feel this way. Has anyone ignored their instincts and put in the effort to improve the relationship with positive results? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
