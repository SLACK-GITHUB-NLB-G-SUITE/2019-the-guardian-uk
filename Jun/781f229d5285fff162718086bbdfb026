What makes a perfect Glastonbury outfit? A mix of statement dressing, comfort and a nod to good times. Which is why the marine pilot Josh Clerk’s look is this year’s festival fashion winner. With relentless sun, Glasto-goers need their accessories to work hard this year. The cap and sunglasses tick all the boxes here, with the shades adding steampunk vibes. Co-ords (two items in matching prints) are a thing for men at Glastonbury. The slightly mismatched leopard here makes it feel a bit cooler and a bit less contrived. Forget the drainpipes of Love Island, the skintight trouser trend was taken to the next level at Glastonbury this year: men in leggings, particularly printed ones, have been a frequent sight. A white sports sock could be a bold move at a muddy Glastonbury, but not in 29C heat. These socks celebrate that dry ground. See also: lots of sandals and even pedicured toes. A five-day party in the sun requires that classic summer accessory: an ice-cold beer.
