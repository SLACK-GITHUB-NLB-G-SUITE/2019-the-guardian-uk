Bayern Munich have a cob on. They’re after Leroy Sané and Callum Hudson-Odoi, but nothing’s happening. They need to get a grip. The Rumour Mill wasn’t happening either until 10 minutes ago, due to an almighty rota cock-up. It happens. Leroy Sané and Callum Hudson-Odoi are still not going to Bayern, as things stand. But here’s the Mill! You lucky people!!! In other Tommy Trinder-related news … the internet kids can’t get enough of this … Arsenal still haven’t bought Kiernan Tierney, though they’d like to .... Manchester United don’t fancy packing off Romelu Lukaku on loan to Internazionale, preferring a ££££ deal ... but popularity’s Ed Woodward does like the idea of the midfielder Ilay Elmkies of Hoffenheim.

Tottenham like the Saint-Étienne defender – and Arsenal target – William Saliba, while Crystal Palace are in for Nice winger and subeditor’s dream Allan Saint-Maximin. To be honest, we owe you a click. But this is life. Come back Monday. Enjoy Friday!
