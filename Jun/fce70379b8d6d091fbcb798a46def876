A 25-year-old woman has been arrested after two RAF jets were scrambled to escort a plane back to Stansted Airport. Jet2 said there had been an “extremely disruptive passenger” on board its flight from Stansted to Dalaman in Turkey on Saturday, forcing the aircraft to return to the London airport. Essex police said a woman was arrested on suspicion of assault and endangering an aircraft. The two Typhoon fighter aircraft caused a sonic boom in the north-east of Greater London as they flew to intercept the plane and escort it back to Stansted, prompting people to call 999 as they feared there had been an explosion. One man described the noise as a “huge bang” that “nearly blew my window out”. Bishop’s Stortford police tweeted: “Large number of 999 calls coming in about a loud explosion. We have liaised with @EssexPoliceUK who are confirming that this is a sonic boom from a passing aircraft.” A Jet2 spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an incident regarding an extremely disruptive passenger on a flight from Stansted to Dalaman earlier this evening. “The aircraft has returned safely and we are liaising with the relevant authorities to support their investigation. “We are working hard to ensure the remaining customers reach their destination as soon possible.” An Essex police spokeswoman said: “We were made aware of a disruptive passenger on an inbound flight to Stansted this evening, Saturday 22 June. “There is a possibility that residents nearby may have heard a loud noise, often associated with a sonic boom, as the aircraft [Typhoon fighters] descended into Stansted airspace. “Officers attended and arrested a 25-year-old woman on suspicion of two assaults and endangering an aircraft. She remains in custody.”
