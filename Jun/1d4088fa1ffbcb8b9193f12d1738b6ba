Food waste is an enormous problem in Australia: according to government figures, more than 5m tonnes of food ends up in landfill each year, costing the economy $20bn. Although much of that comes from food businesses, half comes from consumers, wasting money and resources. So we should all be doing better. Our new series, extracted from a new book from author and food stylist Amelia Wasiliev, takes a look at how to minimise food waste, save money and protect the environment, starting with this fennel and leek scraps gratin.

Pour the cream over the scraps and top with the cheeses. Bake, covered with foil, for 15 minutes, then uncover and continue to cook for another 10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and browned.
