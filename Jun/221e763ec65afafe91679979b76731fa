Finally the answer to the question never asked on University Challenge: “What is Prince Andrew for?” Even the finest moral philosopher would stumble on this one. Now we know: the prince of naff is to keep the US president away from “political conversations” by talking to him about golf. Yes, really: Andrew will accompany Trump on two of the three days of his British trip. Hopefully, then, Prince Charles won’t have to bring up the climate crisis that Trump denies, Prince Harry will not have to defend the supposed nastiness of his wife’s remarks, and he and Prince William will not have to make small talk with a man who said in public he could have “nailed” their mother. The Queen may indeed signal her distaste through the medium of jewellery or whatever, but frankly this visit is an abomination and the royal collusion is vile. Still, Andrew will have a lot to chat about with Trump besides golf. They met 20 years ago at Mar-a-Lago through their former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender accused of abusing dozens of underage girls. In a court statement, Epstein’s former handyman alleged that Andrew used to attend pool parties full of adolescent girls, staying in guest rooms with soap in the shape of genitalia. Classy. After Epstein got out of prison, Andrew was seen strolling with him in New York, shortly after which Fergie accepted £15,000 from Epstein to clear her debts. This was put down, as everything is, to an error of judgment on the Duchess of York’s part. Andrew, it was thought, was no longer such a great ambassador as he hung out with Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif and various oligarchs. Meanwhile, there was much speculation after his “South York” mansion, which had been on the market for five years, was suddenly snapped up for £15m – £3m above the asking price – by an offshore fund in the Virgin Islands. So there is golf, “deals” and a lot else to discuss. This puke-inducing diplomacy is surely what Andrew was born to do. This is the new “normal”.
