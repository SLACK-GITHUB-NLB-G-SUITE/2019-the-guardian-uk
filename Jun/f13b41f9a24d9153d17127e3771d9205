The Australian National University is in damage control after discovering a major data breach a fortnight ago in which a “significant” amount of staff and student information was accessed by a “sophisticated operator”. In a message to staff and students, vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt said someone illegally accessed the university’s systems in late 2018. “We believe there was unauthorised access to significant amounts of personal staff, student and visitor data extending back 19 years,” Schmidt said. Information accessed in the data breach includes: names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, personal email addresses, emergency contact details, tax file numbers, payroll information, bank account details, passport details and student academic records. The university said stored credit card details, travel information, medical records, police checks, workers’ compensation, vehicle registration numbers and some performance records have not been affected. “We have no evidence that research work has been affected,” Schmidt said. ANU is working closely with Australian government security agencies and industry security partners to investigate the attack further, he added. Last July, Australia’s top-ranked university said it had spent several months fighting off a threat to its computer systems, with reports hackers were traced to China. “Following the incident reported last year, we undertook a range of upgrades to our systems to better protect our data. Had it not been for those upgrades, we would not have detected this incident,” Schmidt said. The university has set up a hotline for staff and students concerned about the breach: 1800 275 268.
