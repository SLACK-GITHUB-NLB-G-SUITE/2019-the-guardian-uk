Roger Federer continued his straightforward progress through the French Open draw with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Argentina’s Leonardo Mayer on Sunday. Federer, the No 3 seed, is one of three men in the draw yet to drop a set and he brushed aside Mayer in only an hour and 42 minutes. The 37-year-old did not face a break point in the match, losing only eight points on his first serve, and hit 30 winners. The defending champion, Rafael Nadal, was in action later on Sunday afternoon against Juan Ignacio Londero of Argentina. In the doubles, Britain’s Joe Salisbury reached his second grand slam quarter-final in men’s doubles with his American partner, Rajeev Ram. Salisbury, 27, has enjoyed a rapid rise up the rankings over the past year and, after making his first slam semi-final last season at Wimbledon with Frederik Nielsen, he is now in the latter stages of another tournament with Ram. The pair took on eighth seeds Henri Kontinen and John Peers and a tight match came down to a deciding tie-break, which Salisbury and Ram won to seal a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (5) triumph. In the last eight they will take on the French duo Jérémy Chardy and Fabrice Martin. Kevin Mitchell’s report to follow
