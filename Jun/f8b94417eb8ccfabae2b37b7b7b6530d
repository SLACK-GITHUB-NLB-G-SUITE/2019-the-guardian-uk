Peel and finely grate 300g of carrots into a bowl. Add 150g of brown crabmeat to the carrots. Chop enough coriander leaves to make a couple of tbsp and stir into the crab and carrots, then season with black pepper. Scoop the mixture into 4 large cakes and set aside in the fridge for 20 minutes. Chop 2 tbsp of dill fronds and fold them into 150g of white crabmeat with a fork. Do this lightly, so the crabmeat isnâ€™t crushed to a paste. Warm a thin film of oil, groundnut or olive, in a shallow pan over a moderate heat. Carefully lower in the crab cakes and let them cook, keeping the heat fairly low, until the underside is crisp. Turn each cake carefully, lightly browning each side, then turning again, until all sides are crisp. Lift the cakes out carefully, place two on each plate then place a spoonful of the white crabmeat on top and serve. Enough for 2. The carrots should be finely grated. If they are cut too coarsely, the crab cakes will fall apart. Use firm maincrop carrots rather than the young, thin spring variety for this. Once the cakes are in the hot oil, leave them to crisp thoroughly on the base before turning. Coriander can be replaced by dill for those who prefer it, in which case I would use parsley with the white crabmeat. Paprika or dried chilli flakes could be added to the brown crabmeat if you wish. A little finely grated lemon zest can be good among the white meat, as can a dash of tarragon vinegar. The Observer aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.
