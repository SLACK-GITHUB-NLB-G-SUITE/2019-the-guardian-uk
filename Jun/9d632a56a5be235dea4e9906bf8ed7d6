A man has been arrested by detectives investigating the killing of the Northern Irish journalist Lyra McKee. McKee, 29, was shot in the head by the dissident republican group the New IRA in April while she was reporting on unrest in Derry and standing next to a police vehicle. On Thursday, police arrested a 46-year-old man under the Terrorism Act and took him to Musgrave serious crime suite for questioning. The Police Service of Northern Ireland’s major investigation team carried out searches at properties in the Northland Road and Creggan areas of Derry on Thursday morning. A number of items were seized and taken for further examination. Det Supt Jason Murphy has made a fresh appeal for information to help the investigation. “Since Lyra was murdered following violent disorder in Creggan in Derry/Londonderry on 18 April, our investigation has received widespread support from the community,” he said. “I still want to hear from anyone who has any information and would appeal to the public to contact my team of detectives on 101.”
