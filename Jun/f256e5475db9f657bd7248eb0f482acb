Henry Graham contributed three poems to the 1967 anthology The Liverpool Scene. It was an association he came to regret. In no way was Graham a “pop poet”, despite writing the line “a three-piece suite for my sweet,” with its nod to the Searchers’ hit Sweets for My Sweet in Good Luck to You, Kafka, You’ll Need It Boss. He also featured in Pete Roche’s anthology Love Love Love, as a result of which he appeared on John Peel’s Night Ride on Radio 1 in 1968.
