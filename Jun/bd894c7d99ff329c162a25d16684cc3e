Five people have been arrested and questioned over alleged accounting fraud at Patisserie Valerie, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has said. The arrests took place last Tuesday after a joint operation with the Hertfordshire, Leicestershire and Metropolitan police services. Luke Johnson, the cafe chain’s former chairman and a columnist for the Sunday Times, was not among those arrested, according to the newspaper. Johnson had previously described the discovery of fraud at the business as being like entering a “nightmare parallel universe”. Patisserie Valerie was put up for sale earlier this year after it collapsed following the discovery of allegedly fraudulent activity in its accounts. It entered administration in January after it was unable to secure new financing. The black hole in its finances that precipitated the crisis has turned out to be at least £94m. Chris Marsh, Patisserie Valerie’s finance director, was arrested and bailed following the accounting scandal. The SFO has opened a criminal investigation. At its height, the chain that started life in London’s Soho in 1926 had almost 200 outlets employing 3,000 staff and was once valued at £450m. It was bought out of administration by an Irish private equity firm, Causeway Capital Partners (CCP), and now operates 96 outlets with 2,000 staff. The Dublin-based owner last week laid bare the desperate state of the company it bought in January, including a cost-cutting approach so severe that managers stopped using butter in puff pastry. CCP bought the company out of administration for £5m and described its shock at finding broken ovens, unpaid suppliers, and a leak in the roof at a key bakery site. The cafe firm’s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, has been grappling with the fallout of the alleged accounting fraud since October. An SFO spokesman did not say who had been arrested or what they had been detained for.
