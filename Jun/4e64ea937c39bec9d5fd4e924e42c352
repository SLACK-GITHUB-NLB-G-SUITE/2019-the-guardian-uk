Jason Roy has been ruled out of Tuesday’s World Cup match against Australia at Lord’s. The England opener tore his hamstring in the win over West Indies and has missed games against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Roy returned to the nets for the first time since tearing his hamstring but is not fully fit despite a second scan showing the 28-year-old was making good progress in his recovery. James Vince is likely to continue to deputise and Roy hopes to play against India on Sunday. “Jason went for a scan this morning. It’s all positive news, [but] he won’t be fit for tomorrow,” said the England captain Eoin Morgan. “We’ll monitor his progress in the week. To put one game on it [for Roy’s return] I don’t think is sensible, let’s just see how it goes. “It’s Jason Roy, of course he’s a big loss. He’s an outstanding performer for us. But I’m confident we have the batting covered. James Vince is an extremely talented, gifted player. You can see that just watching him. We’ve every faith in him to go on and get a score at some stage.” England must win at least one of their final three group games against Australia, India and New Zealand in order to progress to the semi-finals.
