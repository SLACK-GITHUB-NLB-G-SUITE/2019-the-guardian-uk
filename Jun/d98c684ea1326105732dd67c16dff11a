The former world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko was rescued by the Spanish coastguard after the chartered boat he was on caught fire on Monday morning. Klitschko, who ended his professional boxing career after losing against Anthony Joshua in April 2017 but has been rumoured to be considering a comeback, revealed the incident happened while travelling from Ibiza to Mallorca. He wrote on Twitter: “Our boat-trip Sunday night ended up in our boat £igniting and family & friends being evacuated by coast guard and fire rescue-team.” Klitschko later expanded on Instagram: “If you are wondering what happened to my family & friends and me while being on a chartered boat from Ibiza to Mallorca early Monday morning, let me state: we are all fine! “We were in rough water and suddenly recognized fire – about 7 sea-miles from the coastline. “It took a while until the situation got under control, but we could count on helping hands from Majorcan coast guard and fire rescue. Thanks to all of them! “All of you: Be careful what you wish for – as this time fate took my wish for ‘some adrenalin during the weekend’ a bit too literally.”
