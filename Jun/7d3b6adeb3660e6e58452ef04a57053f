Tesco has reported a sharp slowdown in underlying sales growth, as political uncertainty and volatile weather held back consumer spending. Like-for-like sales at Britain’s biggest supermarket chain rose 0.4% year-on-year in its first quarter ended 25 May, down from 1.7% in the previous three months. Total sales fell 0.4%, hit by the firm’s decision to close its non-food arm Tesco Direct last July. Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, insisted that Tesco’s turnaround was on track and said it had outperformed rivals in a “subdued market”. Like-for-like sales have grown for 14 quarters in a row. “There is some weakening in consumer sentiment in the UK and clearly part of that is driven by the political situation,” he said. “The other element [is] obviously the weather.” He said volatile weather had weighed on sales of seasonal products such as summer clothes. The year-on-year comparison was tough because in the same period last year sales were boosted by the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, unusually warm weather and the FA Cup final. But Tesco also faces fierce competition from the discount chains Aldi and Lidl. Lidl has unveiled plans for 40 more stores, including its first shop in central London. Lewis said Tesco had sold its stockpiles of tinned and packed food it had amassed in preparation for an exit from the EU at the end of March. The UK’s departure has been postponed until 31 October. He said it was harder for grocers to prepare for leaving the bloc in October, because they would be storing more products for Halloween and Christmas in their warehouses, leaving little space for Brexit stockpiles. Lewis reiterated that the supply of fresh food – which could not be stockpiled – would be the main crunch point if the UK crashed out without securing an agreement. The UK imports about half the fresh food it eats. The trading update came ahead of Tesco’s annual shareholder meeting in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire.
