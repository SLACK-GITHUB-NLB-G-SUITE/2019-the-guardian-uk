What is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing? Over the past few months, writers have been describing their experiences of the one change that worked for them, as part of a weekly series. We have heard stories of overcoming addiction, rediscovering faith, ending an engagement, exercising less, going out more. Now, it is over to you. If you have a story you would like to share – this could be something dramatic like giving up drinking, becoming a vegan or taking up a new exercise regime, or it could be something much more subtle which affected a big change – we want to hear from you. To tell us about the change that worked for you, fill out the form below with some small details about you and the change that you would like to write about. One of our journalists may be in touch further and we hope to publish some of our favourite contributions as part of the series. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
