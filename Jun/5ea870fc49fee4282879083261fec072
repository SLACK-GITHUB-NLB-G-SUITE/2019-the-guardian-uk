The obituary of Peter Whitehead detailed his work in imaginative documentary film, creative writing and falconry, and he also excelled in painting and ceramics. In 2015, Peter gave us his papers, production files, manuscripts, books, records, tapes, pottery, posters, photographs, sculpture and props so that we could curate an archive in his name for the Cinema and Television History Research Institute at De Montfort University, Leicester. It documents both his work and his life because he made little distinction between them. Creativity flowed through everything he did, unrestricted by boundaries of genre or medium. That creativity flows through the stories, which the archive also reveals, of the talented women with whom Peter was romantically involved and collaborated artistically.
