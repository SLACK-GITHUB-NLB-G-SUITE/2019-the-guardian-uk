Star Wars: The Last Jedi actor Mark Hamill has called for Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star to be replaced by one for Carrie Fisher, his co-star in multiple Star Wars movies. Hamill retweeted an article from August 2018 reporting that West Hollywood City Council had voted to remove Trump’s star. Hamill added: “Good riddance! (and I know just who should replace him...) #AStarForCarrie.” Good riddance! (and I know just who should replace him....)#AStarForCarrie ⭐️ https://t.co/DF53fOxshK As reported at the time, Trump’s star had seen a number of attempts at vandalism, and it was highlighted that a number of popular industry figures, including Fisher, George Clooney and Denzel Washington, do not have stars on the Walk of Fame. However, Hamill appears to be labouring under a misapprehension that Trump’s star is to be removed, or that the council have any power to enforce a removal. The stars are owned and overseen by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which has stated that stars will not be removed due to misconduct of the people they celebrate.
