The American runner Gabriele Grunewald has died at the age of 32 from cancer. Grunewald lived with the disease for a decade and continued to train and race throughout, undergoing several treatments to counter the illness, including having half of her liver removed in 2016. Her husband wrote on Instagram that she died “peacefully with no suffering”. Grunewald, the US champion over 3,000m indoors in 2014, is the 12th-fastest American woman in history over 1500m.
