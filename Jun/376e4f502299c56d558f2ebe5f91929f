Blending Cynar, an artichoke-based bittersweet liqueur, with Punt e Mes (or an equally punchy vermouth) makes for a formidable combination. This drink is quite a contrast to the bubblegum sweetness of an Aperol spritz. Expect bold botanicals and rich amaro character. Serves 1 40ml Cynar herbal liqueur20ml Punt e Mes (or a punchy sweet vermouth) 60ml prosecco1 splash soda water2 orange wedges Fill a large wine glass with ice, add the Cynar, vermouth and prosecco, then stir and top up with a splash of soda.
