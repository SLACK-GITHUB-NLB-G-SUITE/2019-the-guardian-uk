Thirty-two people have been injured after a fire that broke out at a migrant centre in Velika Kladuša, in north-west Bosnia-Herzegovina, police said. The blaze erupted early on Saturday morning at the centre, which hosts 500 people stuck in the Balkan country while trying to move towards western Europe. The fire was probably caused accidentally by a cooking device, a police spokesman, Ale Siljdedic, said. The speed of the fire’s spread forced some people to jump through windows to escape, Siljdedic said. Thirteen people remained in hospital with injuries, such as burns or fractures, he said. The fire was put out after several hours. About 25,000 people from Asia and North Africa entered Bosnia-Herzegovina from Serbia and Montenegro last year, and about 6,000 had arrived in the impoverished Balkan country so far this year, according to the country’s security agencies. Only around 3,500 had been accommodated in transit centres, leaving thousands sleeping rough.
