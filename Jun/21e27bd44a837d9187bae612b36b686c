Thousands of BT customers who watch its sports channels will be hit with price rises of up to £48 a year, starting at the end of next month. The telecoms giant has confirmed that customers with the Classic, Essential, Entertainment, Entertainment Plus and Sport Starter deals will pay an extra £1 a month, while there is an increase of £24 a year for those with the Entertainment Starter deal. Those on its Max plan will pay a further £4 a month. All changes come into play on 28 July. Broadband customers who watch the service via the BT Sport app alone will pay £1 a month more, taking the cost to £11 a month, or £132 a year. BT began emailing customers with the details this week. It says: “Some customers will see no changes at all, and we believe we continue to provide unrivalled value for money when it comes to TV and sport content our customers love.” If you are affected by the price hikes, you have the right to remove the BT TV and Sport part of your package penalty-free within 30 days of receiving the notice of the price change. However, you can’t cancel the phone and broadband part of your package if you are still within the minimum term of your contract. Dani Warner, TV expert at uSwitch.com, says price rise announcements are often good moments for customers to assess whether they are really getting value for money for their service. “BT Sport, driven by its football offering, is a premium product, but many will feel they were already paying a substantial amount to enjoy it,” she says. After four price hikes in three years, BT announced earlier this year that it will not be increasing prices for broadband customers in 2019. From March 2020, broadband, landline and mobile plans will increase in line with the consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation from January each year.
