Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our daughter, 17, wants to learn to drive. Do we buy a cheap car (that will cost loads to insure) that she can use to learn and practice? Or is cheaper to hand her over to a local instructor and pay for more lessons? What would other parents advise? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions tomoney@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
