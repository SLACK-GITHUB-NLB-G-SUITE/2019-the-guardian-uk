Freddie Ljungberg is set to become Arsenal’s new assistant first-team coach, with Steve Bould taking charge of the under-23 team, the Premier League club have announced. Former midfielder Ljungberg steps up from his role with the under-23s to work with head coach Unai Emery. “I’m really excited by this opportunity to continue helping develop and work with some of the great young players we have coming through in the first-team environment and to work alongside Unai and his coaching team to help Arsenal win trophies,” said Ljungberg. Arsenal said the changes, which come into effect from 1 July, are designed to help “create a ‘transition team’ which will collectively manage a player’s development through some of the hardest and most challenging periods of their professional lives”. Ljungberg was part of Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ side under Arsène Wenger and had also been in charge of the club’s under-16s squad since starting his coaching career. “I’m looking forward to working in this new structure and to pass on my experience and knowledge about what is needed to succeed at this level,” Ljungberg added. Bould, meanwhile, is to take up a role in the academy, which he ran for 11 years before becoming Wenger’s assistant manager in 2012. The former Arsenal defender will also help oversea the under-23s and under-18 ‘phase programme’ with the current Arsenal academy manager, Per Mertesacker. “I have always had a deep commitment to developing young players and am delighted to be back working in an area which is so important to the future of our club,” Bould said. “We have great young players and my job will be to help them maximise their potential.”
