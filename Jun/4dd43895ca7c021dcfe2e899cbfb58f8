Whether it’s along a city canal teeming with Industrial Revolution history or a bucolic river, waterways lend themselves naturally to a good walk. As well as the simple joy of being by the water, there’s always plenty to see, a natural route to follow and often a cracking pub or cafe at the end of it. We want to hear about your favourite, including what to look out for along the way and any decent pitstops. Try to include starting points and any other useful information, including websites. We’re only looking for walks in the UK this week. Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We are sorry, but for legal reasons, you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share, but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 11 June 2019, 10am BST If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read the terms of service and the terms and conditions.
