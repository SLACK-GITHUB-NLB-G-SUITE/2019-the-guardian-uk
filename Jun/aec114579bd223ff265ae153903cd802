Jos Buttler is “responding well to treatment” on a heavily bruised right hip and while he remains a doubt for England’s World Cup match against West Indies on Friday, the 28-year-old is expected to be fit for selection. Buttler sustained the injury while batting in England’s victory against Bangladesh on Saturday, visibly hobbling after launching one of four sixes during a lively cameo of 64. The wicketkeeper-batsman was in discomfort for the remainder of his innings and did not re-emerge after the break. Jonny Bairstow deputised with the gloves and would happily do so again should Buttler not be passed fit for the fourth group game, while James Vince or Moeen Ali would vie for his place in the XI. The England and Wales Cricket Board offered a cautiously optimistic update on Buttler’s fitness but fell short of confirming his availability for England’s fourth group game, in Southampton. “Jos sustained heavy bruising on his right hip. He is responding well to treatment and will be reassessed later this week,” a statement from the ECB read. “We anticipate he will train with the rest of the squad at the Hampshire Bowl on Wednesday.” Eoin Morgan, the England one-day captain, suggested after the result in Cardiff that there would be no temptation to gamble with Buttler’s fitness. “We’ll use every day as much as we can to get try to get him back on the park, but if he is a risk going into the next game it might not be worth it,” he said. Should Buttler miss the match it would be a major loss to England. He has scored 185 runs in 136 balls in his three World Cup knocks, including a century against Pakistan. Vince would be the closest call for a like-for-like replacement given his role as the squad’s spare batsman but England could also choose to retain their bowling attack en bloc and recall the all-rounder Moeen Ali.
