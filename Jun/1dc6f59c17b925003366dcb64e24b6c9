Using our thumbs at speed to send messages, make calls and browse online, more often than not we make mistakes. We have all been there: from sending a compromised message to the wrong person to incorrectly typing out an account number. Whether you have accidentally called the wrong number and met the love of your life, or have invited an enemy to dinner because of a typo, we would like to hear from you. Have you suffered or benefited as a result of a single wrong number? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below. One of our reporters may contact you to discuss further and we may feature some of your responses in our reporting. If youâ€™re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
