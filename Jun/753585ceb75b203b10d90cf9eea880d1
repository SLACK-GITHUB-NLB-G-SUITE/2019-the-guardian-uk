Tim Jonze’s otherwise informative article on Morrissey’s far-right attitude ( G2, 30 May) asserts that 1992’s Madstock contained “a significant fascist/skinhead element”. I can assure Tim that the majority of the 60,000 fans over that weekend shared Madness’s love of musical, social and ethnic diversity. Incidentally, Morrissey pulled out of the Sunday show after a bad reception the previous night, leaving us with the multiracial Ian Dury and the Blockheads followed by Madness.

It’s a lucid and attractively written illustrated survey, much enjoyed by everyone I have given it to.Catherine PetersOxford • While being convicted in absentia is understandable, being jailed in absentia is a difficult concept (Briton jailed in absentia for 1996 murder of film-maker in Ireland, 1 June).
