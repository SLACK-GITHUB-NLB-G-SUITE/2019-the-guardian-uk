After several years of estimated bills from First Utility, I was asked to submit a meter reading. To my delight, I was advised I was £2,500 in credit and promised a cheque within 10 days. It didn’t come and only when I chased was I told the refund was “under investigation”. I complained, and within five minutes received an email stating the complaint was closed. Then I was told again I would receive a cheque within 10 days. Again it didn’t come. This time it said the finance department would contact me within five working days. A day later, I discovered that the credit had been reduced to £1,500. I’ve still not received any of it and, as a single mother, I could really do with the money. DB, Fairburn, West Yorkshire You might still be waiting if you had not contacted the media. First Utility explained that before it could send the cheque, another monthly bill was generated automatically using estimated readings. This affected the balance, hence the delay. It’s now been recalculated using your meter readings, as it should have been weeks ago and the full £2,524.42 has been refunded along with £50 to acknowledge the incompetence. “We’d like to apologise for the confusion surrounding her account,” it says. “The issue stems from the fact that we did not receive any meter reads so had to use estimates.” It’s important you read your meter regularly and update your supplier, otherwise you either end up extending them a large loan or being faced with a bill for underpayment.
