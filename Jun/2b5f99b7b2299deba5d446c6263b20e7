Fascinating to read about the history of Glastonbury (How a farmer’s ‘silly’ idea became the Glastonbury festival, 5 June). In 1970 we were returning from a holiday in Mullion, Cornwall, with our two small children when we drove past Worthy Farm and, at a whim, my late husband decided to stop there to see what was going on. We had read in the local Bath Chronicle of the plans, so I think Norman knew what to expect, sort of! He said he would hitch a lift back, and I drove home with the boys. I honestly can’t remember how long he stayed at this first Glastonbury festival, but I do recall how impressed he was to have been given a lift back to Bath by Luke Rittner, who went on to become secretary general of the Arts Council. Great memories, often recalled over the subsequent years.Anne KeatCorsham, Wiltshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
