Austria’s supreme court has upheld a decision granting a US request to extradite the Ukrainian tycoon Dmytro Firtash, paving the way for him to face trial in the United States over bribery allegations. Firtash, who denies any wrongdoing, is a former business partner of Donald Trump’s ex-campaign chairman and convicted felon Paul Manafort. He is also a former supporter of Ukraine’s ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich. Firtash made a fortune selling Russian gas to the Kyiv government. A US grand jury indicted Firtash in 2013, along with a member of India’s parliament and four others, on suspicion of bribing Indian government officials to gain access to minerals used to make titanium-based products. On Tuesday, the Austrian supreme court upheld a previous ruling by a lower court that he can be extradited despite his lawyers arguing he is the victim of political “persecution” by the US, which he has never visited. Firtash made no comment as he left the court after the ruling. He is free on bail and, unlike after a previous extradition case, he was not arrested immediately after the verdict was handed down. The Austrian justice minister, Clemens Jabloner, a civil servant who is part of a caretaker government in place until an election which is widely expected in September, must now decide whether to extradite Firtash. His ministry was not immediately available for comment.
