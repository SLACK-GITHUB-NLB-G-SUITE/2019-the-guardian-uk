In the six weeks since the release of Avengers: Endgame, Agustin Alanis has proven his superfan credentials, racking up a grand total of 110 viewings – an average of two a day. His claim means he will have beaten the current Guinness World Record holder for most times seeing the same movie in the cinema, a title previously held by Tony Mitchell, who saw Infinity War, the precursor to Endgame, 103 times. Just in case anyone might doubt Alanis’s efforts, he’s kept his receipts and tweeted a picture of himself with a member of staff on each visit. Round/View 110They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.#avengersendgame #TigreVengador @RobertDowneyJr @ChrisEvans @Russo_Brothers @Avengers @jimmyfallon pic.twitter.com/wYzak4gnGR Is there a particular film that you’ve been to see multiple times at the cinema? Do you consider yourself a superfan and if so, how do you stack up against the competition? Or perhaps you won your superfan title unwittingly – was there a film that you ended up seeing more times than intended or a cult classic that you’ve been to see at cinemas again and again over the years? We’d love to hear about why one film is so special to you. To get in touch, fill out the form below – we’ll feature a few of our favourite contributions.
