Dale Steyn has been ruled out of South Africa’s World Cup campaign, in a sizeable blow to the Proteas. The 35-year-old had been battling to overcome a shoulder injury in time for Wednesday’s hugely significant match against India in Southampton after South Africa lost their opening two matches. But the veteran seamer has been forced to admit defeat in that fitness quest, leaving head coach Ottis Gibson’s side struggling on the injury front. South Africa have called up left-arm pace bowler Beuran Hendricks as a replacement for Steyn, with Lungi Ngidi also nursing a hamstring problem. Paceman Anrich Nortje was ruled out with a thumb issue before the tournament even started. South Africa have endured a wretched start to the World Cup, losing to hosts England by 104 runs then slipping to a 21-run loss to Bangladesh on Sunday. The Proteas now face a must-win clash with India, but their depth will be severely tested. India are yet to play in the World Cup. Gibson had insisted on Monday that Steyn was overcoming the injury but less than 24 hours later the talismanic figure was ruled out of the competition. “Dale is getting closer every day,” Gibson had said. “He reckons he’s about 85%, and we have to decide whether 85% is good enough to play against India. “We lost Lungi, he’s going to be at least a week. We lost two bowlers before the tournament started and now Lungi too. So we’re under pressure, but now there’s an opportunity for the bench to step up.”
