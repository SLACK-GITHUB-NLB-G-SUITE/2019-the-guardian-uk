US billionaire Stephen Schwarzman is donating £150m to the University of Oxford, the biggest single direct donation received by the institute “since the Renaissance.” The money will reportedly go towards creating a single hub dedicated to the humanities, bringing together disciplines which Schwarzman described as ‘critical’ to education, yet often overlooked in favour of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths). Alongside the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities, an Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence will be built to ensure that such powerful technologies are used ‘to the benefit of society’ not its detriment. Do you think the money could have been spent in other ways, such as scholarship and bursary schemes? Could such a large sum be better used outside of academia, for example by charitable organisations or environmentalist projects? Do you know of local groups or little known organisations close to your heart that deserve a similar donation? How would it be valuable for them?
