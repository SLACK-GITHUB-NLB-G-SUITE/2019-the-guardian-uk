Q I am really hoping you could give me some advice. I am currently based in London throughout the week and spend most weekends in Nottingham where I recently bought a property as a first-time buyer. I am now interested in buying somewhere in London together with a friend. I know that I’m not a first-time buyer but my friend is. Are we able to use his first-time buyer rights to secure a 10% deposit mortgage, and what stamp duty would we be expected to pay?MF A The only “rights” first-time buyers have that I know of is not to have to pay stamp duty land tax (SDLT) on the first £300,000 of a property costing up to £500,000, to be able to earn a government bonus with a help-to-buy Isa (individual savings account) and, from April 2021 be eligible for the new government equity loan scheme (which until then is open to all buyers). You don’t have to be a first-time buyer to get a mortgage of 90% LTV (loan to value) where you would need to put down a cash deposit of 10% of the purchase price of a property. Lenders that offer 90% mortgages for first purchases also tend to offer those terms to people who have had a mortgage before. But now for the bad news. If one of the joint buyers of a property has owned – or still owns as in your case – a property anywhere in the world before, no first-time buyer SDLT relief is available even if the other buyer has first-time buyer status. Worse news for you is that because buying somewhere in London means that you’ll have two properties, you and your friend will have to pay the higher rate of SDLT which is three percentage points more than the standard rate. So from a financial point of view, your friend would be better off buying alone or with someone who is also a first-time buyer.
