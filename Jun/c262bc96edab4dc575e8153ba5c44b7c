Two penalties, one early in each half, gave Norway a 2-1 victory over South Korea in the Women’s World Cup at Stade Auguste-Delaune in Reims to secure a place in the last 16 and eliminate their opponents. Norway went ahead in the fifth minute through the new Barcelona signing Caroline Graham Hansen after Cho So-Hyun had pulled down Maria Thorisdottir in the area. However, they were rarely at their best during the rest of the match and had to rely on another spot kick in the 51st minute to keep South Korea at bay. The midfielder Graham Hansen was brought down by Kang Chae-rim and the resulting penalty was converted by Isabell Herlovsen. Graham Hansen was susbstituted shortly afterwards with a sore ankle. South Korea, who had spells of domination throughout the match, gave themselves hope when Min-ji Yeo poked home from short range on 78 minutes for her side’s first goal of the tournament. Yeo had a chance to draw level in the final stages but headed wide as Norway held on for the win. With France beating Nigeria, Norway finish second in Group A, below France, with South Korea pointless in fourth place below Nigeria. Norway will face the runners-up of Group C, Brazil or Australia, in the round-of-16 on Saturday.
