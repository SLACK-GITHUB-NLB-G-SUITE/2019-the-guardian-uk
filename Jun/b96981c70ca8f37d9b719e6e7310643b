We were thrilled to see that Welsh is now “cool” (G2, 13 June). After 40 years of going to the Brecon Beacons national park every holiday and any spare time we have, we decided it was time to learn the language.

With a great former cricketer as prime minister of Pakistan, this surely should be pursued. It was a tragedy when Nehru and Jinnah, who had led the campaign for independence together with Gandhi, forced partition, with the loss of a million lives at the time and continuing conflict, actual or potential, ever since.

Could Sky show the way by offering its services free for this age group?Peter CurbishleyGreat Durnford, Salisbury • Doreen Weppler-Grogan (Letters, 17 June) refers to the island of Cuba as “tiny”, but Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, half as big as the UK and almost as large as England.Richard RiosMiami, Florida, USA
