Lightly scrub 350g of new potatoes then boil them in salted water for 15 minutes or until tender to the point of a knife. Pod enough broad beans to give you 200g of beans. Cook them in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain and pop them from their white papery skins. This is easiest done by pressing them between your thumb and forefinger. Wash 150g of sugar snap peas then cut them into thin shreds and add them to the beans. Slice 3 spring onions and toss with the beans. Make the butter sauce. Melt 125g of butter and set aside. Put 3 egg yolks in a small heatproof basin and place over simmering water. Add a pinch of sea salt then beat gently but firmly with a large whisk, introducing the butter a very little at a time, never ceasing to beat. Gradually add 1 tbsp of lemon juice. Taste for seasoning – you may want to add a little pepper or more salt – then stir in the finely grated zest of a lemon. Melt 30g of butter in a shallow pan and pour in 2 tbsp of oil. Add the potatoes to the pan and let them cook at a moderate pace until lightly crisp then add the shredded sugar snaps, spring onion and the broad beans. When all is hot and sizzling, divide between warm plates and spoon over some of the butter sauce. Serves 2. The number of broad beans in a pod can vary enormously. I usually allow at least twice the weight of beans to the amount I need for the recipe. The butter sauce will separate if overheated – I have often brought it back by adding a splash of boiling water and whisking hard. A crème fraîche-based sauce is a possibility here, too. Stir in some chopped dill or tarragon and perhaps a dash of tarragon vinegar, then spoon it over the sizzling potatoes and beans.
