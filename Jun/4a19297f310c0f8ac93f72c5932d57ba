French golfer Clément Berardo has made an embarrassing exit from a Challenge Tour event, after being disqualified for running out of balls. Competing in the first round of the Andalucía-Costa del Sol Match Play 9 event in Spain, Berardo lost the final ball in his bag on the 16th hole of the Valle Romano golf course, and was therefore disqualified for failing to finish his round. It marked an abrupt end to a nightmare round for the 32-year-old from Auxerre, who began with a quadruple-bogey nine on the first hole and then bogeyed the sixth and eighth holes to reach the turn in 41 shots – six over par. Berardo, who is currently ranked 1,909th in the world, continued to struggle on the back nine at the event in Estepona, near Málaga. He double-bogeyed the 10th and dropped further shots on the 14th and 15th, which left him 10 over par when he ran out of balls on the par-five 16th. Tiger Woods famously came close to suffering a similar fate in the 2000 US Open at Pebble Beach. Woods had taken some balls to his hotel room in order to practice his putting after the second round was suspended due to bad weather, but forgot to replace them.

He was left with just one ball, which he used to complete his round on the way to a record 15-shot victory. His caddie, Steve Williams, did not tell Woods until several months later. England’s Marcus Mohr carded a four-under-par 67 for a share of the clubhouse lead after the first round at Valle Romano, alongside Australia’s Jordan Zunic, France’s Ugo Coussaud and Sweden’s Simon Forsström.
