Chop 75g of coriander leaves and stems and put them in a blender. Pour in 25ml of vegetable or groundnut oil. Peel 50g of ginger, reduce to a purée on a fine-toothed grater, then add to the blender with a peeled clove of garlic, 2 small, hot green chillies, 60ml of lime juice, 3 tbsp of water and a pinch of sugar. Process to a thick paste. Introduce 100g of defrosted frozen peas and continue blending until you have a green, knubbly chutney. Warm a griddle pan. Rinse 400g of prepared squid and cut into rings and tentacles. Dry the squid on kitchen paper, toss in a little olive oil and put on the griddle. Let the squid cook for a minute or two, until it is gold in patches, then remove from the heat. Cook the tentacles and add them to the rest of the squid. Transfer the green chutney to the squid and toss briefly until the squid is well coated. Serve with wedges of lime for squeezing. Serves 2. Ask your fishmonger to clean and prepare the squid, separating the body sack and tentacles. You can slice the body sack into rings at home. Check it over before cooking. It probably goes without saying that the squid needs to be cooked quickly at a very high heat, otherwise it will toughen. Be prepared for a lot of smoke. Don’t be tempted to add the ginger in a lump. It needs to be grated before you add it to the chutney if it’s going to mix thoroughly with the other ingredients. The chutney is also great with scallops or prawns. If you feel there is too much chutney, it will keep in the fridge for a day or two. It is good mopped up with warm bread or used in a sandwich, too, spread thickly in place of mayonnaise.
