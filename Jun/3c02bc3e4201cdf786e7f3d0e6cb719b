We regularly use a similar facility in Morrisons, Guiseley, Leeds.Gill BrookOtley, West Yorkshire • I have met Seven Up’s Neil Hughes on a number of occasions through the parish council network in Cumbria (‘I see my life as a failure’, 3 June).

If for no other reason, it takes huge courage to bare your soul to the nation every seven years.Mark PhillipsAmbleside, Cumbria • I look forward to the improvement in the police officer’s performance (Improvement plan for trampolining officer, 1 June) and hope he manages to add a couple of twists to his somersaults and point his toes more.Ian ThompsonRiding Mill, Northumberland • Should Ike Smith’s welding shop be put out of business (Rumblings of disquiet under the arches, 1 June), then I fear for Alf Tupper’s athletic career – perhaps the second longest in history after Wilson of the Wizard – and his diet of fish and chips.John BaileySt Albans, Hertfordshire • “I have a theory that people often have similar careers to others born on, or close to, the same day.” Please don’t say that, Patricia Pipe (Letters, 3 June): I share my birthday with Nigel Farage.Jane Marsh(Retired charity administrator), London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
