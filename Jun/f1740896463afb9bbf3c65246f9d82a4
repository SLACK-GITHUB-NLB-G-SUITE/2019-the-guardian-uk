Tens of thousands of protesters have forced Hong Kong’s politicians to abandon a debate on the controversial China extraditions bill. Protesters surrounded the legislative council building and swamped the city centre on Wednesday. Masks and cling film have been handed out by organisers to protect protesters from pepper spray as they faced off with riot police who held up signs warning they were prepared to use force on the crowds to maintain stability.
