La La Land star Emma Stone has denied that a shoulder injury that may disrupt the new 101 Dalmatians prequel Cruella was the result of a fall at a Spice Girls concert. The Sun reported that Stone broke her shoulder after falling to the ground as she was sitting on a friend’s shoulders at the concert on 13 June at Wembley; she had been photographed with group member Emma Bunton before the show. The report also stated it took Stone a few days to realise the extent of the injury. However, a report in People magazine from a “source close to” the actor, claimed she hurt her shoulder after “slipping on a floor” at home. The Sun’s report claimed that the film, due to start shooting in London this summer, was “in crisis” because Stone’s injury would affect her ability to play the role. However, People’s source also denies this, saying: “Production on her next film had not yet begun and this is not causing major issues in any way. They continue to be in pre-production and she’ll begin once healed.” The Guardian has contacted Stone’s representative for comment. Cruella is directed by Craig Gillespie and is due for release on 23 December 2020.
