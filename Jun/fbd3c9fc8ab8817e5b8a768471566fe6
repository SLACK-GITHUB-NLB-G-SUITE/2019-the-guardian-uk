Tom, 29When I discovered I was going to be a dad, I was 16. My girlfriend and I had split up and I had been kicked out of school. I was living with my mother, brother and sister on a council estate, and we had no money. I took jobs in a warehouse, a butcher’s, did scaffolding and bricklaying, working from six in the morning till six at night, doing anything I could to buy whatever this baby was going to need. As soon as he was born, I laid him on my bare chest and fell in love. His mum didn’t stay in the picture long, so he came to live with me at my mum’s. I’d wake up at night to feed him. I’d go and see my friends with him strapped to my chest, just enjoying having him with me. I take him with me when I DJ around the world and we have a great time. He’s such a good boy and he wants to pass his exams and go to university. I’m so proud of him. Deaconn, 12My dad was – and still is – a very fun dad. When I was younger, we’d have Nerf gun wars every night. I love going on holiday with him. I’d describe him as perfect, although he can be a bit cheesy. When I was growing up, he made me wear clothes that matched his, which was fine at the time, but I wear my own things now. He’s pretty soft-going, but strict when he needs to be. He’s a very bad cook – we eat out a lot, which is why I’ve grown to love all different types of food. I wouldn’t mind a home-cooked meal once or twice, though. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
