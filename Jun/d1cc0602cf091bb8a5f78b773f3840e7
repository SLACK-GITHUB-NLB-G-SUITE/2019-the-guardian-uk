An animated Spice Girls movie is in the works at Paramount. The film will feature the voices of all five members of the original band and a plot in which the quintet become superheroes. It will be produced by 90s music mogul Simon Fuller, and written by Karen McCullah and Kiwi Smith, whose credits include The House Bunny and Legally Blonde. A director is not yet attached. The film will feature original hits from the group as well as bespoke songs and is said to be a passion project for the women who formulated the concept. Paramount Animation president Mireille Soria told the Hollywood Reporter that the band “hand an idea that we’ve been developing. They are very involved.” Due for release in 2020, the movie is one of a number of new cartoons on the slate from the studio, including a new SpongeBob Squarepants film and Jersey Crabs, a Grease-like musical about warring crustaceans. The Spice Girls founded in 1994 and found global success with songs including Wannabe, Who Do U Think You Are? and 2 Become 1. They have sold 85m records worldwide and are the bestselling female group of all time. A reunion tour featuring Melanie Chisholm, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Brown and Emma Bunton – but not Victoria Beckham – kicked off last month. The Spice Girls’ first film, live action comedy Spice World, took $151m (£119m) at the global box office and $100m in DVD sales despite unfavourable reviews.
