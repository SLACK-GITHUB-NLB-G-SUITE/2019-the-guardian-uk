Thirty-three new measles cases were recorded in the US last week, most of them in New York, federal health officials said on Monday. The new cases brought the number of confirmed cases this year to 1,077, the worst US outbreak of the virus since 1992. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease rose 3% in the week ended 20 June from the prior week. The 2019 outbreak has spread to 28 states. In 1992, 2,126 cases were recorded. All but three of the 33 new cases occurred in New York, with 20 in Rockland county and 10 in New York City, a CDC spokesman said. According to city and state health officials, the state has recorded hundreds of cases of the virus since September. Health experts say the virus has spread among school-age children whose parents declined to give them the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease. A vocal fringe of US parents, some in New Yorkâ€™s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, cite concerns that the vaccine may cause autism, despite scientific studies that have debunked such claims. Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travelers coming from countries where measles is common. CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019. The outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the US from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel and the Philippines, federal officials said.
