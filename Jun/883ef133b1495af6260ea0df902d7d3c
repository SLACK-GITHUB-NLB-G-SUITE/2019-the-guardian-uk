Over the last few years, we have come together around #March4Women to demand action to end violence and sexual harassment in the workplace. This week, world leaders have a crucial chance to answer this call, and turn the wave of global outrage following #MeToo into systemic change for women in the workplace. We call on the UK government not to waste this opportunity to champion a strong global law that protects all women. Governments, employers and workers are meeting in Geneva for the International Labour Conference to negotiate a new global convention to end violence and harassment in the world of work. We urge them to remember the 235 million women around the world who work without any legal protection because one in three countries have no laws against sexual harassment at work. It is the poorest women who are the most vulnerable – domestic workers, factory workers, those women living hand-to-mouth who cannot afford to risk their jobs by standing up for themselves and for each other. An international law is urgently needed. The UK government must be bold, and use its influence to ensure the convention is not watered down or negotiations derailed. Just as it did in the fight to end modern slavery, it needs to be at the forefront of those calling for the most robust legislation possible. We must end this conference with a strong and inclusive convention that provides protection for every woman, everywhere, from the Hollywood studios to the factory floors of Cambodia and serviced households of Latin America. Because abuse isn’t in anyone’s job description.David Arnold ComposerClaire Barnett Interim executive director, UN Women UKMelissa Benn Writer and campaignerChristina Blacklaws President, The Law SocietyDawn Butler Shadow women and equalities secretaryMelanie C MusicianBridget Christie ComedianSimon Neil, James Johnston and Ben Johnston Biffy Clyro musiciansAnne-Marie Duff ActorPaloma Faith MusicianSarah Gavron Director, SuffragetteShaista Gohir Interim executive director, Muslim Women’s Network UKHarriet Harman Mother of the HouseCaroline Haworth CEO, Womankind WorldwideHelen Hayes MPKonnie Huq PresenterBianca Jagger Founder and CEO, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationSioned Jones CEO, The CircleJude Kelly Founder, Women of the WorldSadiq Khan Mayor of LondonLaurie Lee CEO, Care International UKAnnie Lennox Founder of The CircleCaroline Lucas MPImelda May MusicianGordon McKay President, UnisonGirish Menon CEO, ActionAid UKMaria Miller MP, chair of the women and equalities committeeNicky Morgan MPShola Mos-Shogbamimu Campaigner, Women’s March LondonAlison Owen Producer, SuffragetteHelen Pankhurst Gender equality adviser, Care InternationalZelda Perkins Campaigner, former PA to Harvey WeinsteinJess Phillips MPGay-Yee Westerhoff, Eos Counsell, Tania Davis, Elspeth Hanson and Haylie Ecker, Bond Quartet musiciansMichael Sheen ActorSam Smethers CEO, Fawcett SocietyLisa Smosarski Editor, Stylist MagazineAnthea Sully CEO, White Ribbon UKJo Swinson Deputy leader, Liberal DemocratsSandi Toksvig Co-founder, Women’s Equality PartySue Vincent ActorRuby Wax Writer and comedian • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
