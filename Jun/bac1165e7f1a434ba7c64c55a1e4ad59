Donald Trump has provoked widespread laughter on social media with a typo suggesting he had recently met a VIP marine mammal among a roll call of world leaders. Listing ‚Äúthe Queen of England (U.K.)‚Äù and the leaders of France, Poland and Ireland, Trump wrote on Thursday that he had also spoken to ‚Äúthe Prince of Whales‚Äù. Social media users reacted with delight to the gaffe, posting pictures imagining how such a meeting might have looked.

Dumold Trump meeting the Prince of Whales pic.twitter.com/f1i2VCIPFC And users with a long history of Twitter could not help but recall how appropriate the gaffe was, given that Twitter‚Äôs own original emblem of service failure used to be known as the ‚Äúfail whale‚Äù. Prince of Fail Whales pic.twitter.com/dlNTeUhISy During Trump‚Äôs state visit to the UK, he met the Prince of Wales on several occasions, including a dinner at Winfield House, the US ambassador‚Äôs residence in London, where Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, were the guests of honour. The president was tweeting on Thursday in the context of a recent interview where he appeared to suggest he would not contact law enforcement if he were offered information from a foreign power that might help him in the 2020 US election. As yet, unlike with Russia, there have been no suggestions that marine mammals played any significant role in his 2016 victory. Trump has subsequently deleted and posted a corrected version of the original tweet. Trump‚Äôs tweets have previously gifted the world the word covfeve.
