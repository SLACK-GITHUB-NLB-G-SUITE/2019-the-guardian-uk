Dawn breaks at Glastonbury festival’s stone circle in June 2017, as captured by the Guardian photographer David Levene. The early-morning mist mingles with smoke, and Levene’s wide-angle shot captures the crowd – some in semi-silhouette – who had climbed the hill in the early hours to watch the sunrise and take in the views over the site after a night of partying. After a fallow year in 2018, the festival is back next week, with Stormzy, Christine and the Queens and Kylie Minogue all taking to the stage. Levene will be there again with his camera.
