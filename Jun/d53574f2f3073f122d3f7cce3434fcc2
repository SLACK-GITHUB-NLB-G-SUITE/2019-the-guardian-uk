I was slightly puzzled by Amelia Gentleman’s piece on “former Middlesex bowler Richard Stewart” (Another Windrush victim dies without payment or apology, 22 June), as I did not recognise the name despite being a strong follower of Middlesex CCC. But I then remembered that the “Wes” Stewart I recalled from the late 1960s was only a nickname and that his real name was Richard. He was no batsman, but in two and a half seasons with Middlesex he took 127 wickets at the useful average of 24.25, and it was a surprise when he was released at the end of the 1968 season. Having heard nothing about him for over 50 years, it was shocking to hear that he had become a victim of the Windrush scandal and was now dead. A sad and disappointing story.Jack MorganHampton, Middlesex • Only 70 years (The hostile environment was 70 years in the making, TV and radio, G2, 25 June)? More like 114.
