The England netball coach Tracey Neville will step down after the Netball World Cup in July after four years with the squad. Under her leadership the side won the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medal success at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. She is not set to join another team but has said she will take time away from the game to have a family. Tracey said: “Being the head coach is something I have relished and I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to do. Over the last few months I have sat down with England Netball to look at how I could fulfil my role whilst taking into consideration my personal circumstances. My ambition to have a family is something I want to commit to after the Netball World Cup. “The Roses’ future is paramount in my thoughts and plans and I will passionately and wholeheartedly continue to support them and England Netball. I will hopefully get an opportunity to lead again in the future. To the staff/players, past and present you have challenged me in every way possible and I am eternally grateful for your commitment and support within the program and on our journey together.” Jo Adams, the England Netball CEO, added: “I would like to thank Tracey on behalf of the whole netball family for the phenomenal work she has put in to creating a culture where athletes thrive and ultimately deliver magical and historical moments. “We totally support Tracey’s decision with regards to her personal circumstances and we will continue to do so but for now our focus is entirely on giving her and the Roses squad every possible support as they strive to win a home World Cup. “We hope Tracey will be able to sign off with some more wonderful memories in July and having made today’s announcement, hope she is given the space to continue her work with the squad which is her sole focus for now” The Netball World Cup will take place from 12-21 July with England facing Ugnda in their first match.
