Middlesbrough are close to announcing Jonathan Woodgate as their manager. The former Boro and England defender is poised to succeed Tony Pulis, under whom he worked as first-team coach last season. It is understood the chairman, Steve Gibson, is ready to appoint the 39-year-old and the club are putting together his coaching staff. Woodgate made 112 appearances for his home-town club in two spells and ended his playing career there in 2016. He returned as a coach under the interim manager Steve Agnew in March 2017 and worked with the under-18s before being elevated to the senior setup again by Pulis. Woodgate’s former Leeds and Tottenham teammate Robbie Keane confirmed to reporters in Ireland on Wednesday that he had spoken to Boro about the assistant manager’s role, although it is understood he is one of a series of candidates who have been sounded out. Keane is an assistant to the Republic of Ireland manager, Mick McCarthy, and would combine the roles.
