Hull City are on the hunt for a new manager after Nigel Adkins decided to turn down their offer of a new contract. Adkins said in a statement that his and the club’s futures were “not aligned” after a month of talks over extending his deal, which ends on 30 June. “It has been an honour and a privilege to be the head coach of Hull City since I joined the club in December 2017,” Adkins said in a statement. “I would like to thank Assam and Ehab Allam for the opportunity to manage Hull City and also for the offer of a contract extension. “However, it is with a heavy heart and after much careful consideration that I have decided our futures are not aligned and that I will be leaving the club when my current contract finishes.” Adkins’s decision is unlikely to endear the Allam family to the club’s already-disenchanted supporters. Battles over proposed name changes and membership schemes have blighted recent years, with Adkins earning plaudits for guiding the side to 13th in the Championship against that backdrop. Assistant manager Andy Crosby will also leave. “The club would like to place on record its thanks for all of the hard work and dedication Nigel and Andy have shown since joining in December 2017, steering the side to Championship safety in the first few months and then a 13th-place finish last season. We wish them both well for the future,” Hull said. Prior to joining Hull, 54-year-old Adkins had managed Bangor, Scunthorpe, Southampton, Reading and Sheffield United.
