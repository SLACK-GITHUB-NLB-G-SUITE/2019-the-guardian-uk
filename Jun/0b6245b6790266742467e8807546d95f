Australian palaeontologist and conservationist Tim Flannery’s 30-year-long study of Europe’s natural history began in Oxfordshire with an encounter with newts, unknown in Australia: “Newts are such primitive creatures that watching them was like looking into time itself.” In this journey from prehistory to the present day, Flannery offers a bold and rich panorama of Europe’s ecological history. He vividly describes how the European landmass was created and shaped, and how its flora and fauna evolved. Europe is “where the investigation of the deep past began”, and this book is also about the science that has brought ancient history alive. Flannery begins when the European “zoogeographic region” first emerged 100m years ago, with “groves of palms and ferns overtopped by ginkgos”. Salamanders and newts date from this time, as do midwife toads, “living fossils” that are reminders of Europe’s dawn. The climate crisis and globalisation raise new challenges: almost every European tree is threatened by an Asiatic disease or parasite. Industrial farming has also reduced the bird population by 421 million in just three decades. But Flannery’s superb study shows that Europe is a land of “exceptional dynamism” and resilience – amazingly, there are now more wolves here than in the US. New species are constantly arriving and adapting, helping to “make Europe anew”. • Europe: The First 100 Million Years is published by Penguin (£10.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
