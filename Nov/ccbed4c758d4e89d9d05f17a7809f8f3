More than 6,000 homes across the UK still have black and white television licences, according to the latest figures published by TV Licensing. Half a century after the advent of colour on the BBC, there are still 1,311 black and white permit holders in London, while Birmingham has 323 and Manchester has 245. We want to hear from people who still watch television without colour. Was your decision fuelled by nostalgia? Is your household ‘old-fashioned’ in other senses? Do you do it because it’s cheaper than paying for a colour licence? Does it make it difficult to watch modern programmes? If you’re one of the 6,000 black and white TV licence holders in the UK, we’d love to speak to you. Please get in touch via the encrypted form. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
