In South Africa pressure is not having a job. It is one of your friends being murdered. Rugby shouldn't be something that creates pressure. The World Cup is like a rollercoaster ... You get down the first slope and you are not sure if you are going to throw up or hang on. We need to bring chaos into their organisation. They won it, I don't think we lost it. Our game is about intimidation. Some people might not want to hear that, but that's a fact. I don't know where it comes from. It's inside. It's in there. Today, we had to go there to fetch it, and it came. Japan did not exceed my expectations. They met them. I was behind the last man and I started laughing because the forwards were driving so well I couldn't yell. If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled. If you play it later, then that’s when we are finished for Christmas, you’d have Santa Claus giving out the World Cup. The things that happen in this tournament don't happen in other sports. You've got the Canadian blokes cleaning up (after Typhoon Hagibis). I want to set a good example and show what being a man is. Being a man isn't losing your rag and your emotions. It's about being calm. I think the better team lost today. They came out with a hiss and a roar, gave us a punch to the nose from the get-go. We'll be kicking stones for four years. And it's hard to kick stones for four years. I never dreamed of a day like this at all. When I was a kid all I was thinking about was getting my next meal.
