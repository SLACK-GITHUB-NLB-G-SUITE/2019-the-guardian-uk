Ray (Taylor Kitsch) and his accomplice Michael (Stephan James of If Beale Street Could Talk) hope to buy and sell 30 kilos of cocaine – but arriving at the pickup point they discover 300 kilos, uncut. Panicked, they gun down the seven cops that arrive on the scene. “This was either dumb luck or a setup!” says detective Andre Davis (Black Panther’s Chadwick Boseman, oozing quiet charisma and leonine intelligence). Sienna Miller plays a narcotics expert who talks like a Bronx dame; a set piece takes place at a salsa club in the meat-packing district. There’s a pulpy, comic-book noir to this highly enjoyable thriller, whose rules and parameters are clear. “Close the island. Catch them by 5am,” instructs Davis’s superior, limiting the action to Manhattan after midnight.
