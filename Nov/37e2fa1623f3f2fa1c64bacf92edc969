At least five members of a family in northern Mexico, including two infants, have been killed in a gun attack, a government source and local media said, in the latest episode of grisly violence to hit the country. Mexican media reported that the victims belonged to the LeBaron family, associated with a breakaway Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico decades ago, and that the dead as well as additional missing family members may all be US citizens. The governments of Chihuahua and Sonora states, both of which border the US, issued a joint statement late on Monday saying an investigation into the incident had been launched and that some people were presumed dead and others missing. The statement, which noted that additional federal and local security forces were being sent into the area near the border between the two Mexican states, did not provide further details. Local television showed images of a burnt-out vehicle that may have belonged to the family, and Julian LeBaron, a local activist and family member, was quoted as describing the incident as a “massacre”, adding that some family members had been burned alive. The press office of the US embassy in Mexico did not immediately respond to requests for further information. The US ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, travelled to Sonora earlier on Monday, he said on Twitter.
