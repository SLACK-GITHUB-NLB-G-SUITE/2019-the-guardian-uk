I have been driving an electric car for almost five years and nearly 60,000 miles. I understand the due process essential to the spending of public money but your article (Questions raised over UK’s state-backed fund for electric car charging, 9 November) made me despair. Electric vehicle sales are growing rapidly and the provision of chargers needs to keep up; nothing should slow their provision. EV drivers’ eyes light up when they know there are Instavolt chargers on their route: no multitude of radio-frequency identification cards, no apps, no pre-registration, no funds held for years by the charging companies. Just wave your credit card at the machine, charge and get on your way. Due process or not, the right decision seems to have been made. Hopefully more charging companies will follow Instavolt’s model and make charging simple.David BricknellPlymouth • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
