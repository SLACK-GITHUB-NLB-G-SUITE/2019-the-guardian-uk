In the Blair/Brown government’s last days, the crown estate commissioners opted to privatise their four residential estates in London, one of which was in the constituency of Frank Dobson (Obituary, 13 November). He was a most active and supportive MP in our campaign to prevent it. Some time later, in a televised House of Commons debate on housing, he was sitting with Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell when a Tory minister absentmindedly called them “New Labour” and then had the grace to start to apologise. Frank growled “We’re Heritage Labour”.Mary Pimm and Nik WoodLondon • In the beautiful view of a snowy day in Canada on the letters spread, in the mist could be seen the ghostly image of Frank Dobson from the obituary on the following page.
