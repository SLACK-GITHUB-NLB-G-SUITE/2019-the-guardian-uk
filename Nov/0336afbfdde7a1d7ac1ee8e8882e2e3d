Police have found a body believed to be that of missing British tourist Aslan King in bushland on the Victorian south coast. The body was found in a creek at 10.15am on Tuesday, just 1km from the campground at Princetown on the Great Ocean Road where the 25-year-old Bristol man was staying. King was last seen at the campground at 2am Saturday, when he apparently ran into bushland after hitting his head. Police conducted a four-day search for the man, with helicopters, mounted police, State Emergency Services volunteers and employees from Parks Victoria. In a statement, Victoria Police said the manâ€™s body had not been formally identified but they believed it to be King. A report will be prepared for the coroner.
