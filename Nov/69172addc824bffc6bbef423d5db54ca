Thousands of residents in Southern California have fled their homes because of a wind-driven wildfire burning in mountains near Santa Barbara. As many as 6,300 people have been evacuated and about 2,400 structures were threatened early Tuesday, Santa Barbara county fire spokesman Mike Eliason told KEYT television. The fire erupted Monday afternoon in Los Padres national forest, but evacuations were ordered in the town of Goleta, north of Santa Barbara. The fire has grown to about 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares). Weather forecasts have predicted winds with gusts of 60 to 70 mph at times into Tuesday morning but rain is expected later in the day.
