However a yellow severe weather warning for icy patches forming on roads, pavements and cycle paths has been issued overnight for the eastern part of Northern Ireland. The lowest temperature of the autumn thus far, -7C, was recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. Southern and western England bore the brunt of the persistent rain on Saturday with sunshine in the north and east. Met Office meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said there were potentially difficult driving conditions in areas affected by the showers. The first snowfall of the season was also recorded on Saturday in Wales and in Shropshire. Yeomans added: “It was quite a dusting in a few places.” Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the areas worst affected by the heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday. Train operator Northern has advised passengers not to travel on some routes, including between Sheffield and Doncaster, Sheffield and Goole, and Doncaster and Scunthorpe.
