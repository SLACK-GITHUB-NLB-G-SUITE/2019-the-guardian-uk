England’s Tyrrell Hatton triumphed at the Turkish Airlines Open following a record-equalling six-man play-off which finished under floodlights. Hatton defeated Austria’s Matthias Schwab with a par on the fourth extra hole to win his fourth title in memorable circumstances in Antalya. Hatton, Schwab, Kurt Kitayama, Victor Perez, Benjamin Hebert and Erik Van Rooyen had all finished tied on 20 under par to set up the third six-man play-off in European Tour history. The players were sent out in two groups of three on the par-five 18th and Van Rooyen was the first man eliminated after a wayward drive led to a bogey six. Hatton looked in danger of an early exit as well after a clumsy third shot from the back of the green, only to then chip in from 40 feet for an unlikely birdie which was matched by Kitayama. Overnight leader Schwab, who had missed a birdie putt on the 72nd hole to win the tournament in regulation, was the only player in the second group to make birdie to leave three players heading back to the 18th tee. All three missed good birdie chances on the second extra hole and the floodlights which can illuminate the back nine at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal were turned on before the trio headed back to the 18th. Hatton looked set to seal victory after a superb pitch to two feet set up a certain birdie, but Schwab holed from 20 feet for a birdie before Kitayama missed from closer range and was eliminated. On the fourth extra hole Hatton turned away in disbelief after his birdie putt from eight feet to win the title drifted past the edge of the hole. But moments later he was celebrating victory after Schwab missed from close range for par after being on the back edge of the green in two. The High Wycombe-born golfer thus sealed the fourth European Tour victory of his career, after success at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in 2016 and 2017 and the Italian Open, also in 2017.
