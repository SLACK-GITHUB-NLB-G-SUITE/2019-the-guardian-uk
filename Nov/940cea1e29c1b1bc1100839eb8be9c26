Pete Doherty has received a three-month suspended sentence for affray and been fined a total of €10,000 (£8,500) after being arrested in Paris twice in one week. Doherty was detained on 7 November after buying cocaine in the Pigalle district. He was arrested again on 10 November after fighting with a teenage boy in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. His lawyer, Arash Derambarsh, said that Doherty was celebrating his release from jail and had consumed alcohol, valium and sleeping pills. His suspended sentence relates to the latter offence, for “violence while intoxicated”. Derambarsh told Reuters: “It is a lenient decision. Mr Doherty will be able to keep singing. It is what we had asked.” The Libertines are due to commence a European tour in Luxembourg on Sunday. Representatives for Doherty said that his legal situation should not affect the tour schedule.
