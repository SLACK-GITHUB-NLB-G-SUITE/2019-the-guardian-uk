Larry Elliott expresses support for Brexit on the basis that the EU is pro-business, anti working people, and the embodiment of neoliberal ideas (Inside the Guardian, 9 November). However, he does not confront the fact that his decision to vote leave has provided support for an even more extreme form of neoliberalism promoted by the leave campaign of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the ERG. Out of the frying pan into the fire might be the appropriate observation.Charlie MasonHermon, Pembrokeshire • If the EU is as Larry Elliott says – pro big business, anti working people, undemocratic, neoliberal – then why are rightwing neoliberals in the UK, across politics, economics and the media, passionate leavers? Surely they should be very happy in the EU?Richard MiddletonCrossmichael, Dumfries and Galloway • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
