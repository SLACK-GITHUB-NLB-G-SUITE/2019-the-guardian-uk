Living in the Stirling parliamentary constituency, I appreciated your profile of it (Report, 18 November), but I felt it skirted around a critical issue that is replicated in many other parts of Scotland. In Stirling, where the contest is between the Tories and the Scottish National party, unionist remainers like me are faced with a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea. As you rightly said, Stephen Kerr, the Tory candidate for Stirling, has revealed himself to be a solid Brexiter. He voted for Theresa May’s deal on all three occasions and for Boris Johnson’s deal, and supported Johnson during the Tory leadership contest. The SNP is anti-Brexit, but sees the election as a stepping stone to Scottish independence. So what is a Stirling unionist remainer to do? Indeed, what are such voters elsewhere in Scotland to do? With a heavy heart, I think the answer is to vote SNP. The priority has to be to stop Brexit and therefore do everything possible locally to prevent a Tory majority across the UK. Should Brexit be stopped, the debate around Scottish independence will reshape dramatically, and it can right now be regarded as an issue for the future.Christine HoweKillearn, Stirling • Graham Judge (Letters, 14 November) says the decision of ITV and BBC to not include Jo Swinson in the head-to-head debates is undemocratic. Given that the Lib Dems only have 60% of the 35 SNP MPs, the genuine third largest party in the UK, does he not view his own wishes as undemocratic by excluding Nicola Sturgeon, or does Westminster democracy end at Hadrian’s Wall?John HolroydThornhill, Dumfries • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
