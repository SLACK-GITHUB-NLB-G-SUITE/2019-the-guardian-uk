Manchester United are weighing up a move in January for Jadon Sancho, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær alerted by the forward’s recent troubles at Borussia Dortmund. The manager has identified Sancho as a summer target but he and Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, have a policy of trying to sign players of interest in the preceding winter window should there be a chance of doing so. The 19-year-old was last month dropped and fined by Dortmund for being late back to training after England duty. Last Saturday he was taken off after 36 minutes of the 4-0 defeat by Bayern Munich, then criticised by his manager, Lucien Favre, who confirmed Sancho had not been injured. Sancho started England’s 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday. If United firm up their interest in January they may face competition from clubs including Liverpool and Real Madrid.
