If Val Harrison and other readers write to their MP and ministers about food banks as she suggests (Letters, 22 November), I hope they have more success than we’ve had here in Kent. We’ve lobbied our local MP several times, and contacted the responsible secretary of state. All we get back is a total lack of responsibility or even any acknowledgment that there’s a terrible shame in the levels of hunger in this country. We’ve seen the local food banks and churches struggling to feed children and families in the long summer holidays. Now Swale Foodbank reports a surge in demand, with 729 emergency parcels given out between 1 April and 30 September this year, helping to feed 1,487 people, of whom 469 were children. All politicians who ignore hunger, poverty and destitution disgrace this country. It’s time for change.Kay MurphyBapchild, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
