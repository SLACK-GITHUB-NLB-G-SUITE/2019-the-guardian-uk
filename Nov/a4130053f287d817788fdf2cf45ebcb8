Air from Siberia heading towards a huge chunk of the US could set record low temperatures from Texas to New England between Monday and Wednesday. National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Donofrio said on Saturday the National Digital Forecast Database indicated that some 200 records might fall. For example, the expected high on Tuesday of 23F (-5C) at Chicago’s O’Hare airport would be a full 5F (3C) lower than the record-low set in 1995. The cold front was expected to move through the upper midwest and the northern plains on Sunday, then continue south and east on Monday and Tuesday, sending temperatures below freezing all the way south to the Gulf coast. The front will bring January-like temperatures to some locations that are expected to be as much as 30F (17C) colder than normal for the time of year. Donofrio said the leading edge of the system would bring some snow this weekend and on Monday, which is the Veterans Day holiday. Although the snow is expected to taper off on Monday, temperatures are forecast to keep falling.
