As a millennial, a university student and a human, I thank you, Guardian, for your 2019 environmental pledge (It’s time to act, 17 October). Yours is a news outlet that many of my generation are sharing all over social media. You speak the truths we speak and believe in. We young people sometimes feel unheard and brushed away or simply ignored when we speak our minds. So thank you for pledging to use language that recognises the severity of the crisis we’re in; it is something that is rarely done. With the current fires surging through our precious lands, it is a time of stress, loss and sadness, and one that we are not accustomed to. We are angry. Listen to our generation more, hear our voices and follow our movements. We are the future, after all; one day everyone will have to listen, so why not start now.Courtney LucasTarragindi, Queensland, Australia
