Willian has said he wants to stay at Chelsea and is waiting for the club to offer him a contract before his deal runs out at the end of the season. The winger can leave Chelsea on a free transfer next summer and his future remains uncertain, even though Frank Lampard has made it clear he wants to keep the 31-year-old. Willian, who is entitled to start talking to other clubs in January, is eager to begin negotiations over an extension and he said it was down to the club to present him with fresh terms. “I feel happy here,” the Brazilian said. “I feel happy to play for this club but the situation is not in my hands. It’s in their hands. I’m waiting for them. They know what I want, what I want to do, so I wait for them.” Willian, who has scored three goals this season, said he would not put pressure on Chelsea by speaking to other clubs. “I don’t want to talk to them because I have a contract until the end of the season. I am a Chelsea player but I just want to say the club know what I want to do.” Willian, a £32m signing from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013, said Chelsea were fortunate to draw 2-2 with Valencia in the Champions League on Wednesday. They defended badly at Mestalla but they will qualify for the last 16 if they win their final game in Group H, at home against Lille on 10 December, regardless of what happens when Valencia visit Ajax. “The end of the game was crazy and it’s difficult to play at Valencia with the atmosphere,” Willian said. “At least we got a point and now we have a decider at home. I think we got a little bit lucky but it was like this so now we go to the game against Lille.” Marcos Alonso also faces an uncertain future at Chelsea. The 28-year-old left-back did not travel to Valencia and could be up for sale next summer. Chelsea are looking at signing a left-back and have targeted Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell, 22, who has also been linked with Manchester City.
