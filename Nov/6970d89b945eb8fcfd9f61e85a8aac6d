The fame and expensive lifestyles of celebrities can feel relentlessly distant from our own lives. They seemingly live in entirely separate worlds. But sometimes they enter our orbits, reach out and make a big impression. We want to hear about your experiences of celebrity acts of kindness. Has Keanu Reeves ever genuinely thanked you? Did Timothee Chalamet speak to you on a plane for hours? Has Lady Gaga ever invited you on stage? We would like to hear about your encounters with famous individuals in detail. Has a certain celebrity ever done something nice for you? What exactly was it that they did? Was the act unexpected? Do you have a picture of the moment that you would like to share with us? Did it change your overall perspective on celebrities as people? If youâ€™re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
