Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My partner is desperate for Apple AirPods Pro wireless earbuds for Christmas, but they cost £250. I’m convinced he’ll lose them in a week. There are £50 wireless ones on the market. Are they really that much different to the Apple ones? Please recommend me a good, low priced rival. Do you have a problem readers could solve?
