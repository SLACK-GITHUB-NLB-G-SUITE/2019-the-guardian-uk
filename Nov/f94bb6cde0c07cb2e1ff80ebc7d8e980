You are right that “a fairer distribution of domestic, caring and paid employment” is the route to greater gender equality (Editorial, 9 November). But Nordic experience also shows that this is best achieved through a portion of adequately paid parental leave (months not weeks) earmarked for fathers on a “use it or lose it” basis. Unlike the current “shared parental leave scheme”, taken up by a tiny percentage of eligible fathers, entitlement should be the father’s and not contingent on the mother’s eligibility. There is some evidence that such a policy can have a longer-term impact on fathers’ involvement in childcare.Ruth ListerEmeritus professor of social policy, Loughborough University • My granddaughter’s class was photographed by Steve McQueen (Letters, 13 November).

London is sometimes envied or resented, but these pictures celebrate the fact that we can all live together, understand each other and create a better world.Alicia BakerLondon • Stuart Jeffries (And another thing, G2, 6 November) moans about the Jam single News of the World being used as the intro music for Mock the Week and “lining the pockets of Paul Weller’s mohair slacks”. But presumably the songwriter (and singer) of the single – bass player Bruce Foxton – takes the lion’s share of the royalties.Colin SpenceScunthorpe, North Lincolnshire • Re animals having the vote (G2, 13 November), once the turkeys organise themselves it will make my life a lot easier.
