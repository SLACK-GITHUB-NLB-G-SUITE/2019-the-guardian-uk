Lewis Hamilton is to begin discussing his future in Formula One and a new contract with Mercedes. His deal runs until the end of 2020 and the driver anticipates a stressful and confrontational renegotiation. Hamilton has won five titles with Mercedes, clinching his sixth championship at the US Grand Prix in Austin. He has repeatedly stressed his loyalty to the team but is not looking forward to renewing discussions, having done a deal in 2018. “I only just did this contract and already I have to start talking about the next one,” he said before Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix. “Which is frustrating because it is another stressful moment where you have to get into the room, get into the ring, and have a friendly yet intense conversation about terms and all of this kind of thing.” He emphasised the task would be characterised by both sides pushing their positions. “I think it is just confrontation isn’t it?” he said. “You are both trying to see what more you can get out of it. How you can do things better, things that you have to change.” Hamilton still enjoys racing and while rumours circulate about a move to Ferrari, it seems unlikely with Mercedes displaying such strong form. The 34-year-old appeared more concerned with the length of a new deal. “It is daunting when you think of it coming up,” he said, “because you are also committing to a period of time in your life and it is sometimes hard to imagine that far ahead. But it is nice to be wanted.” There was only limited running on a rain-affected first practice at Interlagos. Red Bull’s Alexander Albon was fastest despite crashing late in the session. Valtteri Bottas was second and Sebastian Vettel third. In the dry in FP2, Ferrari were on top with Vettel two-hundredths in front of his teammate Charles Leclerc. Max Verstappen was third in front of Bottas and Hamilton.
