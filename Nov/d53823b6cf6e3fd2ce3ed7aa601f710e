My husband and I have been together for nine years, and have two kids. He’s a good man: he cares about us, cooks for us and takes the kids to school. But I don’t feel sexually satisfied. I was his first girlfriend, although I had a few sexual partners before him. He is clumsy in bed, and often foreplay involves a lot of awkward elbows digging into me or fingers poking me uncomfortably. His lack of confidence is really unappealing. I also feel like a nag because I have to remind him to do anything around the house. I am struggling to feel I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Is there anything we can do to make our marriage better? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
