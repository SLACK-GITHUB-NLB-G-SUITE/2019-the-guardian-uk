I must have watched Dylan Moran’s DVD of Monster, recorded at Vicar Street in Dublin, about a hundred times. It’s storytelling, almost character standup but the gag rate is higher than most one-liner comedians. Oh, if you haven’t seen it just watch it, it’s bliss. Cake Factory from Big Train. It’s a very simple and tight idea and lovely writing but the thing that makes it are the performances from Simon Pegg and Rebecca Front. I have very boring dreams. I once dreamed I was making toast for ages. I woke up and was both bored and annoyed that I still had to make the toast. My friend Mike Bartlett – who I went to school with and who has since written some of the best dramas on TV and in the theatre – makes me laugh probably more than anyone else. I don’t understand how a hairstyle is funny. Does that mean something you regret? Or are embarrassed by? I don’t care how I look very much so all my haircuts are both wonderful and hilarious. Colin Hoult’s alter ego Andy Parker had the quip: “Never apologise, never explain. [Beat] Sorry, I got that from a book.” Jonny and the Baptists play Barnsley, Saturday 9; Newcastle upon Tyne, Tuesday 12 November; touring to 18 December
