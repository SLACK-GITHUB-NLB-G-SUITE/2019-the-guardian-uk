England will be without Steph Houghton, Alex Greenwood, Jodie Taylor and Ellen White for Tuesday’s friendly against the Czech Republic in Ceske Budejovice. Phil Neville’s side lost 2-1 to Germany on Saturday in front of 77,768 spectators at Wembley and they have achieved only one victory from their past seven matches. White, who scored against Germany, will be rested in order to manage her training load following a return from a knee injury. Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Lyon), Rachel Daly (Houston Dash), Mary Earps (Manchester United), Beth England (Chelsea), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Abbie McManus (Manchester United), Beth Mead (Arsenal), Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Nikita Parris (Lyon), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City), Jill Scott (Manchester City), Lucy Staniforth (Birmingham City), Demi Stokes (Manchester City), Carly Telford (Chelsea), Keira Walsh (Manchester City), Leah Williamson (Arsenal). It is a similar story for fellow Manchester City teammate Houghton but ankle and back injuries respectively have ruled out the Lyon defender Greenwood and the Reign striker Taylor.
