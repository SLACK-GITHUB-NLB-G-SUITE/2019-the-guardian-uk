In 1853 Marian Evans declared that she would rather kill herself than return to live in her native Warwickshire. For the past two years the 33-year-old Nuneaton native had been forging an independent life for herself in London. Working as assistant editor at the prestigious Westminster Review while lodging in the Strand, Evans now considered herself a paid-up member of the liberal metropolitan intellectual elite. No longer required to rub shoulders with small-time farmers and ribbon manufacturers, these days Miss Evans was more likely to be found discussing philosophy with Emerson, gossiping about Dickens and attending concerts with her almost-fiance, the sociologist Herbert Spencer. Now, though, Evans was being summoned “home” by her brother Isaac, the de facto head of the family. The young patriarch, who had inherited the family business from their late father, insisted that Marian make herself permanently available to their sister, Chrissie, newly widowed and struggling with too many children and not enough money. The prospect filled Evans with dread. “To live with [Chrissie] in that hideous neighbourhood amongst ignorant bigots is impossible to me,” she spluttered. Nuneaton and Coventry, where Eliot lived until she was 30, are both firmly lodged at the heart of Brexit Britain As it turned out Evans didn’t kill herself, nor did she return to the Midlands. Instead, adopting the pseudonym George Eliot, she poured her memories of “that hideous neighbourhood” into a series of glorious and highly profitable novels. Coventry, where she had nursed her ailing father for nearly a decade, became immortalised as “Middlemarch”, the setting for her greatest novel. Bulkington, an otherwise undistinguished village close to her childhood home, became Raveloe, the village where Silas Marner weaves his linen and shuns his neighbours. St Ogg’s in The Mill on the Floss was partly modelled on Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, while Hayslope in Adam Bede is Ellastone, the Staffordshire village where Eliot’s father had lived as a young man. As for the “ignorant bigots”, Eliot, whose bicentenary falls on 22 November, turned them into some of the richest characters ever to appear in English literature. There’s Rosamond Vincy, the vain ribbon manufacturer’s daughter, mortified by her mother’s provincial accent and determined to leave the mediocrity that is Middlemarch by ensnaring handsome newcomer Dr Lydgate; Maggie Tulliver longing to escape parochial St Ogg’s for a life of intellectual and creative fulfilment; Dorothea Brooke, dreaming of an expanded existence, far greater than the tightly circumscribed sphere open to her as a country-dwelling gentlewoman of independent means. Eliot’s understanding of what it means to be a young woman stuck in the unpromising provinces has proved inspirational for generations of clever girls of modest means. Rebecca Mead, author of My Life in Middlemarch, remembers how, as a grammar-school girl in 1980s Weymouth, Eliot’s heroines provided her with the hope of another kind of life. “Weymouth was three expensive hours from London by train, there was no university and only one crappy bookshop. When anyone new arrived from outside, it was just like Lydgate turning up. I was thrilled.” Reading Middlemarch (subtitle: “A Study of Provincial Life”) in the sixth form gave Mead moments of intense identification. “I knew what it felt like to be Dorothea, to long for a life of higher culture and intellectual passion.” Mead says she recognised Rosamond’s cravings too. “She dares to think that she could do much better than the clumsy local young men who pay court to her. When glamorous Dr Lydgate arrives, Rosamond sees at once that he offers her the best chance of marrying someone more cosmopolitan.” Eliot’s validation of Mead’s inchoate longings for a life beyond Dorset must have worked a kind of affirmatory magic. The 17-year-old’s close reading of Middlemarch got her a scholarship to Oxford to read English, from where she went to New York and, in time, a job on the New Yorker. Recently Mead returned with her family to live in London and is in the early stages of writing a book about being confronted with Brexit Britain. This insistence on taking a second look at the place you have come from chimes with Eliot’s own practice. “George Eliot may at first glance seem to validate her characters’ and readers’ desire to move away from the provinces,” says Ruth Livesey, a professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, “but the point is that she always insists on returning us to those original communities, so that we can think about them in new ways.” Just as with Dorothea, Maggie, or Gwendolen Harleth in Eliot’s last novel, Daniel Deronda, we are asked to reconsider the value of an ordinary life, lived not at the centre of the known world, but at its very edge. At its most basic, this switch of perspective involves jumping from one character’s viewpoint to another. “The most famous example is when Eliot abruptly stops the plot of Middlemarch to ask ‘But why always Dorothea?’ before launching into an exploration of what the world looks like from the perspective of Casaubon, the ageing pedant with the ugly white moles,” explains Livesey. Casaubon may be creepy, but Eliot insists that he has as much right to his point of view as the lovely young heroine. Scaled up, Eliot’s project of radically decentring the world requires us to consider what it might feel like to belong to a different gender, class or tribe from the one to which we instinctively feel we belong. It remains a mystery why her bi-centenary will have fewer candles and cakes than her near contemporaries, the Brontës It is this kind of emotional and intellectual flexibility that we need more than ever. Nuneaton and Coventry, the two urban centres where Eliot lived until she was 30 and where she set nearly all her novels, are both firmly lodged at the heart of Brexit Britain. In 2016, 66% of Nuneaton voters chose to leave the EU; in Coventry the number was 55.6%. The industries that used to flourish in the area and provided employment for so many of Eliot’s minor characters – food processing, cloth making, even mining – are long gone. Unemployment in both towns is higher than the national average and the shabby high streets are home to more pound and pawn shops than artisanal cheese stalls. Nonetheless, Nuneaton remains a place of deep value to the London-based political classes. Despite its economic and aesthetic meagreness, its citizens have high aspirations. Traditionally Labour, in 2010 the town was taken for the Conservatives by Marcus Jones, a local man. In the 2015 general election David Cameron was reported as saying that he knew his party had won the whole country when the Nuneaton result came in at 1.53am. Now regarded as a bellwether seat, it is spoken about in the same way as today’s “Workington Man” by political strategists. It is a glib, useful psychological trick for when you are talking about people on whom you depend but whom you cannot control. It is one way of masking your terror and your resentment. This recent habit of reducing people to types – Worcester Woman, Mondeo Man, White Van Man, Essex Girl – would have appalled Eliot. Her chief message is that we must learn to identify and honour the particular differences between us while acknowledging our shared humanity. “Art is the nearest thing to life,” she wrote in an essay for the Westminster Review in 1856. “It is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.” Another of her celebrated statements on the subject comes in Adam Bede (1859), where she justifies her interest in the ordinary lives portrayed in Dutch Golden Age domestic paintings – a woman getting her lunch, a working man enjoying a pint of beer in the pot house, “those homes with their tin pans, their brown pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions”. And when, in The Mill on the Floss, Eliot thinks she hears her readers objecting to the fact that her novel’s setting is so dreary and her characters so provincial, she admonishes sternly: “I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is necessary that we should feel it.” For until we have understood what life is like for the Tullivers and the Dodsons, we are in no position to judge them for holding preferences and opinions that are so different from our own. Again and again Eliot demonstrates that her practice of returning to rural Warwickshire – “midmost England, unmitigated England” as Henry James has it – is not simply an exercise in slack provincial pastoralism, written to soothe a nostalgic urban readership. You only have to look at Silas Marner (1861), generally considered to be the novel in which she temporarily took leave of stern social realism in favour of folk tale whimsy, to realise that she is always concerned with finding the largest and most pressing themes in the smallest and most obscure lives. The book, about a poor Calvinist weaver falsely accused of stealing church funds, deals with the harsh realities of immigration, religious fundamentalism, disability, a changing labour market, queer family making, environmental violence and rapacious inner-city development. The Mill on the Floss, meanwhile, continues to resonate powerfully with Nuneaton A-level students. “When Tom tells Maggie that she has brought dishonour on the Tulliver family name by being seen unchaperoned with a young man, and that she is now an outcast, it’s a dilemma that speaks very powerfully to pupils of Asian heritage, particularly the girls,” says Vivienne Wood, who taught for years at Nuneaton’s King Edward VI Sixth Form College. “They understand immediately just what is at stake.” With Eliot’s bicentenary next week, it remains a mystery to those who love her best just why she will have fewer parties, presents, candles and cakes than her near contemporaries, the Brontë sisters. It can’t be the off-centre setting. The Brontës’ novels are stuffed full of dialect, and Heathcliff hardly speaks the King’s English. Livesey suggests that it may be because “while Eliot is provincial, the Brontës are regional”. Regional, in this case, takes on a sense of romantic isolation, of gothic strangeness, of swooping depth and height. Eliot’s Midlands, although only 100 miles away from Haworth, are in every sense “flat”. The landscape is level and so, by and large, are the emotions. Eliot’s characters grow and change through tiny increments and as a result of constantly rubbing up against one another over time. This is a supremely relational art, grounded in the ordinary and the everyday, and all the more powerful for it • Kathryn Hughes’s series George Eliot: A Life in Five Characters is broadcast on Radio 4 each day at 9.45am from Monday.
