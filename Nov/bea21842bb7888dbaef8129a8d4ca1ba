Wilfried Zaha scored in back-to-back games for Crystal Palace for the first time since February and his manager, Roy Hodgson, is bracing himself for the opening of another transfer window. Zaha handed in a transfer request in the summer but Palace rejected offers from Arsenal and Everton to keep the 27-year-old at Selhurst Park. The club chairman, Steve Parish, has said he would allow Zaha to leave in January for the right club at the right price and the winger has been in impressive form. After scoring a belated first goal of the season in last week’s defeat by Liverpool, Zaha scored the opener just before half-time. Hodgson said: “He’s a good player isn’t he? He’s capable of causing problems to any defence anywhere in the world, when he’s in good form like he is, when he’s as concentrated as he was today.” Zaha tore Burnley apart here last season and he finished off a driving run at the end of the first half, while substitute Jeffrey Schlupp took advantage of poor defending to secure the points 12 minutes from time. Burnley had won their previous two matches 3-0 but were sloppy at both ends, with Chris Wood missing a golden chance after a mistake by Cheikhou Kouyaté and Ben Mee’s error playing in Schlupp. Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, said: “I’m certainly not despondent about the performance. We just didn’t find the key moments we have been finding but no lack of organisation or effort or commitment, it was just that they found the moments and we didn’t.” PA Media
