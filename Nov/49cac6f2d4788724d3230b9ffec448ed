Time was, I’d have bet my house against Count Arthur Strong finding a mainstream audience. He seemed so niche – which is what they say about John Kearns, double Edinburgh comedy award-winner and cult purveyor of mock-heroic suburban standup. But Kearns’ plangent storytelling, made more tragicomic by being performed in fake teeth and tonsure wig, just gets richer, and might easily amuse a wider audience. Not that he is doing badly: he’s on a two-week run at Soho theatre with Double Take and Fade Away, a mesmerising day-in-the-drab-life of a man with dreams, frustrations and too much time on his hands. It finds Kearns suited, booted and waiting on a phone that never rings. So instead he stares at the ceiling (cue memories of a visit to the Sistine Chapel), walks through the woods and reels at the philosophical implications of a Nigella Lawson recipe. There’s a wider variation of tone here than in previous shows, in that Kearns’ fury repeatedly boils over – with the German tourists who don’t get his Michelangelo joke, and (very funnily) at having to compete for comedy audiences with Dad’s Army. (On Private Godfrey: “He’s a Victorian!”) But the show’s resting heart-rate is gentle, as Kearns finds the poetry in the overlooked everyday, and shares ambitions – for a made-to-measure suit, say – that are both modest and, to Kearns, mindblowing. It is delivered in a style that’s all his own: that of the misunderstood south London savant toting outskirts existentialism. Now scintillated by his own insight, now letting another lyrical rumination peter into silence. Who would bet against the standups of 2119 having to compete against John Kearns’s evergreen sitcom? Not me. • At Soho theatre, London, until 7 December.
