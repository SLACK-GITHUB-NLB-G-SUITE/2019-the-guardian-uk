Numerous gunshots have been fired at the Chicago home of Jeff Tweedy, frontman of the Grammy-winning indie rock band Wilco. His wife, Susan Miller Tweedy, detailed the incident in a Facebook post. She reported hearing: “Seven to 10 shots fired at what sounded like right at our house … A bullet went through the storm door to our balcony and lodged in the wooden door.” She added that Jeff found seven bullet casings outside their home. There were no reported injuries from the incident, which took place early on Tuesday morning and was reported to Chicago police by numerous people in the Irving Park neighbourhood. Tweedy’s son Spencer told local radio that he did not believe his family were deliberately targeted. Gun crime is a serious problem in Chicago. On one weekend in early August, seven people were shot dead and 46 wounded, leading mayor Lori Lightfoot to say: “As a city, we have to stand up and do a hell of a lot more than we’ve done in a very long time.” A month later, seven people were killed and 34 wounded over the Labor Day weekend; in October, three were killed and 21 wounded in another single weekend. Earlier this month, Chicago police reported that murders were down 11% and shootings 10% during the first 10 months of 2019, compared with the same period in 2018.
