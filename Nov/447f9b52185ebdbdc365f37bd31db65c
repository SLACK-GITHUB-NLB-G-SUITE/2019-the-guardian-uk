So all the fine talk about “inspiring the next generation” and “creating sporting legacies” turns to ashes as the England rugby team are pictured pushing their baggage through a deserted airport terminal. This team, one of the youngest ever to play in a World Cup, beat Argentina, Australia and New Zealand – the latter two in successive weeks. As the retired head of a sports college, I know we won’t inspire the next generation if we perpetuate the idea that the only people of any value are the ones who lift the trophy and, in England’s case, ignore the humble and talented squad who prepared so wholeheartedly in order to represent their country in a fiercely intense competition. Their arrival time should have been publicised so that we could have given them a heroes’ welcome.Chris DunneLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
