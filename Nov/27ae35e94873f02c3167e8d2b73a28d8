Paul McCartney has heavily hinted he will be performing at the Glastonbury festival in 2020. He posted an image on his Twitter featuring Philip Glass, Emma Stone and Chuck Berry: Glass-Stone-Berry, or Glastonbury. pic.twitter.com/ATdjMoiehi McCartney has been one of the more strongly rumoured names to headline the landmark edition of the festival. In April, Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis said he hoped McCartney would play again, “hopefully for the 50th”. In September, McCartney said in a Radio 2 interview: “People are saying that it will be good if I did it, so I’m starting to think about whether I can or whether it would be a good thing … It’s starting to become some remote kind of possibility.” He would be the second artist to be confirmed for the festival, following the announcement of Diana Ross as the Sunday teatime “legend” performance on the Pyramid stage. McCartney has headlined once before, in 2004, when he played a mammoth 33-song set spanning the Beatles, Wings and his solo material, including two encores. It featured a segment paying tribute to his Beatles bandmates, with Here Today – his 1982 song that poignantly addressed John Lennon in the wake of his death – segueing into George Harrison’s All Things Must Pass, and Yellow Submarine, originally sung by Ringo Starr. There was also an outing for In Spite of All the Danger, a song he recorded in 1958 with Harrison and Lennon in pre-Beatles band the Quarrymen. The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis said of that performance: “Paul McCartney looked surprisingly nervous. His between-song patter wobbled a tightrope between charming and excruciating. There was much talk of ley-lines and ‘vibes’. He displayed a worrying tendency to adopt a cod-Jamaican accent. It scarcely mattered: his back catalogue is unimpeachable, his voice fantastic.”
