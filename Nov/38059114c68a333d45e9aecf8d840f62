Daniel James has said he stands up as soon as possible when kicked to show opposition players no fear of intimidation. The 22-year-old again impressed in Manchester United’s 3-1 win over Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday. One run drew a free-kick when Lewis Dunk fouled him – the Brighton defender was booked – and from the dead ball United forced their second, a Davy Pröpper own goal. James also caused Dan Burn to be shown a yellow card for a harsh challenge, yet the Welshman likes to demonstrate a steeliness when brought down. “I’ve been used to it,” he said. “Last season in the Championship [with Swansea] I had a lot of hits. If a defender hits you and you stay down he might think he’s got the better of you, so to get up and keep going is important. “I’ve always had it [this mentality]. It’s important to keep getting back up. It’s part of the game. If I can get forward and win free-kicks high up then it’s good.” The victory lifted United to seventh with 16 points after 12 games, and, alongside Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, James is helping to form a promising attack. “We’re really enjoying our football at the minute,” he said. “Maybe it’s taken a few weeks to mould but we’ve all got that connection together and it’s important.” Rashford’s goal was a ninth in 17 games in all competitions for United with three league assists, while Martial has five in 10 appearances with three league assists, and James has three in 16 with two assists. Following Martial’s return from injury United’s form has improved, wining five out of their seven matches with one defeat. “Since he’s come back in we’ve got that focal point,” James said. “He’s a great link-up player. He can come short or go in behind. It’s been important for me and for Marcus since he’s come back into the team to get that interlink. Since he’s come back he’s got goals and he’s got assists and he’s been great.”
