What’s for breakfast? There’s nothing better than cornflakes with hot milk. It’s my Sunday treat. They taste so much better when the cornflakes have gone all squidgy. The hot milk relaxes me, so I normally have a little snooze after. What were Sundays like growing up? They were lovely. We’d get up. My dad would clean the car. No one would rush around. And we’d always have a family roast around 3pm. Secret to the perfect roast potato? Plump them up a bit, lots of rock salt, hot, hot fat, lots of love and in they go. That’s how you do them GC-style, honey. Sunday treat? It’s got to be a hot pudding with custard. Treacle sponge, bit of jam roly-poly. I think it’s acceptable to eat custard on Sundays. Love or dread Monday mornings? What do sharks do on Monday mornings? They get up and start biting. That’s me. Best way to change a duvet cover? I have to be honest, I have people who do that for me. I think you have to button it inwards, not outwards? I can’t remember. I have a team of cleaners, in case one is off sick or goes on holiday. I probably haven’t made my own bed for the past 10 years, honey. Sunday TV? I always put on the same film. I watch Planet of the Apes back to back. The new trilogy. I’m obsessed. I must have watched them more than 100 times. That’s all I ever watch on a Sunday. If they made a sequel, I’d love to play an ape. Should every day be like Sunday? In a dream world, too right. But we can’t live in a dream world. We’ve all got bills to pay, you know what I mean? Gemma and TransferWise have collaborated to raise awareness of hidden foreign currency fees at wi.se/gemma-collins
