Burnley are on a slide again after losing three league games in a succession, and a major concern for Sean Dyche will be the nine goals conceded in the process. West Ham are usually accommodating visitors in these circumstances, their recent away form has been poor and Burnley won this fixture last season comfortably, though Manuel Pellegrini is under a certain amount of pressure at the moment and can ill afford to be overtaken in the table by today’s opponents.
