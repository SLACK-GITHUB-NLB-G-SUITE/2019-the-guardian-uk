The Harp (50 of the cosiest places to stay around the UK this winter, 9 November) is indeed a worthy winner of the country pub of the year but to suggest that the place to visit is Hay on Wye when much closer are the two brilliant little towns of Presteigne and Kington is madness. The glorious walk to the latter along Hergest Ridge will improve your wellbeing so much more than plodding around bookshops. Also, remember there’s no such thing as bad weather – just the wrong clothes. Janis BellOld Radnor, Powys • What a pity that the Arts Council didn’t think of relocating the Eduardo Paolozzi sculpture from outside Euston station (Historic sculpture stranded in middle of building site, 11 November) to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.Ann NewellThame, Oxfordshire • I’m sure the British Library, a few yards down the road, would happily act as foster parents for the Paolozzi statue. A suitable position could be found in the piazza until a permanent location is decided.Angela BartonBishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire • I note your report (11 November) that a shop in York is stopping the playing of “cheesy Xmas songs” for “the sake of staff morale”. Perhaps it would be possible for all shops to avoid cheesy Christmas songs – for the sake of all of us.Peter DuckersShrewsbury, Shropshire • Since a litre is already a volumetric measure, I think Marina Hyde (Journal, 9 November) has her metrics in a twist when she says that, in the Brexit hoohah, “millions of cubic litres of demons have been released in the past three years”.
