An intriguing Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury, full of sub-plots, could fall to Borice (3.00), from the Gordon Elliott stable that does so well in handicap chases but has yet to win this one. The Irishman singled out this horse as a Grand National type as soon as he came over from France a year ago and, while it took time for this big animal to show his ability on the track, he surely did so in the Galway Plate. He seemed outpaced at times that day but finished strongly, suggesting this tougher test will suit. There should be plenty more to come and double-figure odds make him attractive, for all that Elliott could be in stronger form. Yala Enki is interesting on his first start with Paul Nicholls but the Welsh National is thought to be the aim. Cabaret Queen has evidently improved but her new mark looks stiff. Regal Encore and Brave Eagle are two at bigger prices who could get involved. 1.50 Newbury A brave and classy winner at Ascot in January, Downtown Getaway is a horse with a future who should be ahead of the handicapper. His April flop is easily forgiven but his jumping will need to be slicker this season. 2.05 Newcastle It is hard to see past Nicky Henderson’s Buveur D’Air as he tries to be the first since Comedy Of Errors to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle three years in a row. Silver Streak is a useful rival but would be getting 13lb in a handicap. 2.25 Newbury Another Henderson runner on what may be a big day for the yard, French Crusader won easily at this track when last seen a year ago. That was his handicap debut and there should be plenty more to come, though this is a step up in class. 3.20 Newcastle With the Henry Oliver yard finding some form, Kilfilum Cross makes plenty of appeal. Second in the Kim Muir on his second start for Oliver, the grey ran well over too short a trip on his reappearance at Halloween. 3.40 Newbury A late mistake kept No Comment in third on his reappearance but it was an encouraging run from a horse who has dropped to a good mark. This step down in trip is an interesting experiment.
