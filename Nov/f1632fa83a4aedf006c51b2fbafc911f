The alleged rape investigation involving Julian Assange, who is in prison in Britain, has been discontinued. The deputy chief prosecutor, Eva-Marie Persson, told a news conference: “I want to inform about my decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation.” Tuesday’s decision follows a ruling in June by a Swedish court that Assange, who denies the accusation, should not be detained. Two months earlier, the WikiLeaks founder was evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been holed up since 2012. He was immediately arrested and is serving a 50-week sentence in Belmarsh prison in London for breaching bail conditions. He is also fighting extradition to the US, which accuses him of publishing secret documents.
