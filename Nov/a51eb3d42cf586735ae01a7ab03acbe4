Prince Andrew has agreed to speak publicly about his friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein for the first time, in a “no holds barred” interview with the BBC’s Newsnight programme to be broadcast on Saturday night. The prince has been the subject of fierce speculation over his relationship with the financier, who was found dead in his New York jail cell three months ago. Epstein’s accuser Virginia Giuffre claims Prince Andrew was “an abuser, a participant” in her exploitation as a teenager and says she was forced to have sex with him. Andrew has always denied the allegations but has struggled to stop the flow of damaging claims, including newly released footage showing him at Epstein’s home in 2011 after the financier was released from jail. Newsnight sources said the interview was a result of six months of negotiations with the royal household, with an agreement that there would not be any advance vetting of the questions. The interview was conducted on Thursday at Buckingham Palace and the BBC has decided to broadcast a special edition of the show at 9pm on Saturday. It was conducted by the lead Newsnight presenter, Emily Maitlis, who promised it will be “no holds barred”. The palace has until now relied on issuing strongly worded press statements, while some newspapers have reported “sources close to Prince Andrew” saying that a photo of him with Giuffre is fake because his fingers are “much chubbier” in real life. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew in 2001 when she was 17 after being flown to London on a private jet. She has previously said that while he denies the claims, “he knows the truth and I know the truth”.
