We very much welcome Bristol city council’s commitment to improving the city’s lethal air quality by banning all privately owned diesel vehicles from the inner city by 2021 (Bristol becomes first UK city to ban diesel cars to fight pollution, 6 November). Now local governments across the UK must follow suit and go one step further in a bid to tackle the impending climate emergency for current and future generations. The climate crisis is the greatest environmental and health risk of the 21st century, and transport accounts for 26% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the main sources being petrol and diesel cars. Quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will require more than a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, however. The upcoming general election provides political parties with an opportunity to develop ambitious plans to reduce car journeys, especially in cities, and curb polluting vehicles before 2040. Ahead of the election, we are asking the next government to commit to bold action on road transport emissions and to prioritise cleaner forms of travel, such as walking and cycling. This includes: sustained long-term investment in walking and cycling; a 20-minute neighbourhood planning principle for all cities and towns; helping more children walk, scoot and cycle for their school journey; and a UK-wide ban on pavement parking. Failure to do so will have dramatic implications on the health of our planet and future generations.James CleetonEngland director south at Sustrans, Bristol • Bristol wants to ban diesel cars from its centre. Such a shame that all the trains that go there use diesel engines since the government stopped electrification.John LoaderWest Witton, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
