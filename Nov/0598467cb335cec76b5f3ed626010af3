The Moorland Association’s Amanda Anderson (Letters, 26 November) has nowhere to hide among the heather, like the grouse her association protects for the purpose of shooting. Her plea for moor burning is spin: her association is a protective body for the shooting class, and the moors must be protected as their playground. But the moors need trees, shrubs and more ecological variety, not huge fires, autumn closures and the desert-like emptiness that comes with preserving a monoculture for the rich to satisfy their bloodlust. I live among this and my feeling as I walk or run on the moors is of fear, not wild freedom. The moor burning is horrific every year, the shooting establishment and landowners seem ever more powerful, and the pseudo-green spin is deeply sinister.Catherine FrancisBurley in Wharfedale, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
