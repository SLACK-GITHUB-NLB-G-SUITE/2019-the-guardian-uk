Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s description of Brooke’s The Soldier as “snivelling ethnocentricity” (Brexit poetry offers pleasure and catharsis, Journal, 7 November) showed a marked lack of empathy for the catharsis of others. During and after both world wars, many soldiers and their wives/widows, children/orphans have found solace in Brooke’s stirring words. One could debate the merits of patriotism, but this poem is not “snivelling ethnocentricity”.Mark ThompsonRomford, Essex • Joel Golby says TI’s behaviour in having his daughter’s hymen checked annually “borders on abuse” (G2, 8 November). Under Working Together to Safeguard Children and Young People, every school and college in the land would refer that behaviour for what it is: abuse. Many abusers attempt to justify their actions – we should not pander to them.Liz LeekBarnsley College • “I hope the horseradish plants I gave you thrive,” Jeremy Corbyn wrote in his response to Tom Watson’s resignation letter (Report, 7 November). Horseradish is sharp, deep-rooted and impossible to get rid of. What a gift, what a metaphor!Elaine YeoEnfield, London • How about adding a bleakness rating to your reviews? Peter Bradshaw gave Sorry We Missed You five stars (Review, 2 November) but it deserved five shovels for the depths of despair it evoked. After I, Daniel Blake, I should have known the latest Loach would be gruelling but it left me without any hope at all. What a world we live in.Wendy DearCottenham, Cambridgeshire • Before politicians talk of gold standards in education (Ofqual orders more lenient marking in GCSE French and German, 6 November) they would do well to remember what the sterling gold standard did to the economy.Roy BoffySutton Coldfield, West Midlands • Further to the fracking moratorium correspondence (Letters, 4 November), I have just re-read an earlier article (Britain to use £1bn green fund to support Argentina fracking, 23 October). Says it all.Ruth StylesFrankton, Warwickshire
