For many attempting to share Thanksgiving posts on Facebook on Thursday morning, it seemed the social network was not in the holiday mood. Thousands of users complained about issues with Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram, citing problems with sharing posts and sending messages, according to Down Detector, a website that tracks such outages. With error messages from Hanoi to Portland, the services seem to be affected across the world. Twitter seemed to be functioning without glitches, allowing aggrieved users of Facebook and Instagram to share error messages and, sometimes, enjoy the silence.

As recently as October, both networks and another Facebook product, WhatsApp, were reportedly down for several hours. The apps run off a similar infrastructure, and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been working to integrate them further, as he announced earlier this year. On Thursday, WhatsApp seemed unaffected. Neither Facebook or Instagram immediately responded to reports of malfunction.
