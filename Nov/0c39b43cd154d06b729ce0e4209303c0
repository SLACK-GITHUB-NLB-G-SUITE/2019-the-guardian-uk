Cate Campbell became Australian swimming’s biggest money earner in a single year after a clean sweep of her events at the World Cup series finale in Doha. The former world champion on Saturday claimed the 100m freestyle final in 52.61 seconds, to finish ahead of her younger sister Bronte and Sweden’s Michelle Coleman on the closing night of the three-day meet. The win came two days after the 27-year-old Campbell took out the 50m freestyle final in 24.11 seconds, holding out Coleman and Bronte Campbell. The victories ensured Campbell was the overall winner of the World Cup women’s standings worth $219,000 - her 333 points eclipsing Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu (312) and Coleman (174). Campbell also secured top spot in the standings for the final two cup rounds - called a cluster - in Kazan and Doha to receive an additional $73,000 in prize money. She also won the cup cluster in October, snapping up another $73,000, and was second in cluster one, adding another $51,000. Cash prizes in individual World Cup events are also on offer with $2,200, $1,450 and $725 handed out to the top three place-getters respectively. Campbell was not done yet as she anchored Australia to gold in the mixed 4 x 100m medley relay to close out the meet and share the winner’s prize of $4,350. She has also scooped $23,500 over just two legs of the 25m, short-course International Swimming League this year. Meanwhile, Emily Seebohm clinched her fourth 200m backstroke victory in seven World Cup races in 2:08.54 to pip fellow Australian Kaylee McKeown by 0.02. Brad Woodward took silver behind American Michael Andrew in the 100m backstroke while Alex Graham was second to Danas Rapsys of Lithuania in the 200m freestyle.
