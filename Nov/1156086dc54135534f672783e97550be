Five Napoli fans were arrested after skirmishes outside Anfield before Liverpool’s 1-1 Champions League draw against the Serie A side. Claims that Napoli fans were carrying golf clubs as weapons were, however, dismissed by police. “Merseyside police is aware of social media posts saying Napoli fans are armed with golf clubs in the city centre,” said a statement earlier in the evening. “Officers have responded and confiscated a number of flags attached to flag poles. No golf clubs have been found,” stated Merseyside police after the game. “Officers policing the LFC v Napoli CL game arrested five Napoli fans,” added the statement. “Three men were arrested for violent disorder and another was for affray following disorder on Walton Breck Road before the game. A fifth man was arrested for breach of the peace at the turnstiles on Anfield Road.”
