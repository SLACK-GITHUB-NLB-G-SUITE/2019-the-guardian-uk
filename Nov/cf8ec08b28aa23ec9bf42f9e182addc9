A lovely pick-me-up for a winter’s evening: the tannins in the tea syrup and the coffee note from the bitters provide a wonderfully comforting backdrop for the citrus-infused gin and bitters. Serves 1 For the infused gin375ml gin – we use Plymouth190g citrus fruit, cut up into small pieces (lemon, lime, orange or grapefruit, or a mixture) For the tea syrup250ml water1 English breakfast tea bag450g caster sugar For the drink60ml infused gin – see above20ml tea syrup – see above1-2 drops coffee bitters1 orange twist and 1 maraschino cherry, to garnish Put the gin and citrus fruit in a clean jar, seal and leave to infuse for 24 hours. Strain into a sterilised jar, seal and refrigerate – the gin will now keep for up to two months. For the syrup, simply boil the water, drop in the tea bag and leave to brew for a few minutes, then stir in the sugar to dissolve. Once cool, the syrup will keep in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to a month. To build the drink, pour the gin, syrup and bitters into a mixing glass, add ice, stir and strain into a cognac or old fashioned glass. Add a few ice cubes, garnish with a twist of orange and a cherry, and serve. • Francesco Pittala, Rockwell Trafalgar Square, London SW1
