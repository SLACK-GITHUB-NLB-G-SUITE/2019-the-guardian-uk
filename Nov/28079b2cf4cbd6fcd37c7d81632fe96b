More than 70 MPs have so far announced they will stand down at the 12 December general election, already well above the 31 who did not seek re-election in 2017. There is concern at the number of female MPs, including Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd, who have cited the extent of the abuse they are subjected to as a reason for their departure. One in six of the women who were elected for the Conservative party in 2017 have stood down. There have also been warnings that many moderate Tories are standing down. As well as Morgan and Rudd that group includes David Lidington, Ken Clarke, Alistair Burt, Claire Perry and the prime ministerâ€™s brother Jo Johnson. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond has also stood down after 22 years. More MPs have stood down before other elections, with 90 not standing again in 2015 and 149 in 2010.
