The song in which Eminem “sides with Chris Brown” over his assault of Brown’s then girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 has leaked. “Of course I side with Chris Brown, I’d beat a bitch down too,” he raps in the track, titled Things Get Worse, which was reportedly recorded during the sessions for his 2009 album Marshall Mathers. Elsewhere on the track, Eminem references beating a sex worker “mercilessly” and leaving her “for dead”, putting Natasha Bedingfield in a washing machine and murdering actor Dakota Fanning, who would have been approximately 16 at the time of recording. After a seven-second snippet of the song was leaked last week, the Guardian contacted representatives for Eminem. They did not respond to requests for comment. Brown attacked Rihanna when the then couple were on their way to the 2009 Grammys. Brown was found guilty of felony assault and sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling and six months of community service. Eminem and Rihanna have collaborated on a number of occasions. They recorded Love the Way You Lie for his 2010 album Recovery, and Love the Way You Lie (Part II) for her 2010 album Loud. The pair of songs found both artists reflecting on their respective experiences of abusive relationships. At the time, Rihanna told MTV News that she was shocked Eminem wanted to work with her. “’Cause, you know, he always raps and talks shit about pop artists and pop female artists.” The pair collaborated on another single, The Monster, in 2013. In 2018, Eminem rapped about leaving “hickeys” on Rihanna’s neck on Killshot, a diss track aimed at rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
