Club Brugge scored a 92nd-minute equaliser but then had two men – including the goalscorer Krépin Diatta – sent off for their celebrations in an extraordinary conclusion to their Champions League Group A match against Galatasaray. Diatta had cut in from the wing to smash home from distance, but then wheeled away, removing his shirt. This attracted a second yellow card from the Slovakian referee Ivan Kruzliak, who had booked him earlier. He was immediately joined in departing the defender Clinton Mata, whose contribution to the celebrations was a flying scissor-kick on a corner flag, which snapped it clean in two. He too received a second yellow card. Adem Buyuk had opened the scoring for Galatasaray in the 11th minute with a neat flick and volley after Omer Bayram’s cross. It was the Turkish side’s first goal in their five group games. Their only other point in the group came from a goalless draw in the reverse fixture in mid-September. The result confirmed Real Madrid’s qualification for the knockout stages, as Club Brugge needed victory to keep their slim hopes alive. Real hosted Paris Saint-Germain later on Tuesday.
