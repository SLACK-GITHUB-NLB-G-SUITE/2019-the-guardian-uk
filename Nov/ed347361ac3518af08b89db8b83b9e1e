It is disappointing to read that when the so-called National Portrait Gallery closes (Report, 6 November), not one of the works to be sent on exhibition in other areas of the UK will come to Wales. Luckily we have a whole raft of splendid galleries and museums here already. Fiona CollinsCarrog, Denbighshire • What on earth is the RMT union thinking of by calling a rail strike during a general election (Report, 6 November). Do they want to give a boost to the union-bashing Tories? Roy AppleyardHerne Bay, Kent • Re Cherry Weston’s letter (7 November), as the constituency of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has been a Labour stronghold since 1983, whether the woman in Merthyr casts her vote according to the elemental composition of Boris Johnson’s testicles is highly unlikely to make a vas deferens.Adrian BrodkinLondon • At least people recognise violins (Letters, 7 November). When I asked at the lost property office at Lancaster bus station about my instrument they couldn’t find it. Weeks later they got in touch, to say that a snooker cue case they’d found actually had my flute inside.Matthew NewmanLeeds • Just a thought for all those violinists and viola players who are prone to leaving their instruments on trains: learn the tuba instead. You’ll never leave a tuba on a train. From experience I can tell you that it’s difficult to forget, no matter how long a time you’ve spent in the pub.Colin GrahamLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
