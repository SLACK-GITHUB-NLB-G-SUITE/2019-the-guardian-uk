Joey Barton, the manager of Fleetwood Town football club, will go on trial next year accused of assaulting the former Barnsley manager Daniel Stendel during an incident following a match. Barton, 37, is alleged to have pushed Stendel at Barnsleyâ€™s Oakwell stadium on 13 April, leaving him with a damaged tooth. The former England international pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he appeared at Sheffield crown court on Wednesday. A provisional trial date was fixed for 1 June 2020. Barton, of Widnes, Cheshire, stood in the dock, flanked by a security officer, for the 15-minute appearance. He spoke to confirm his name and date of birth, that he was a UK national, and that he understood various matters outlined by the judge. He entered a not guilty plea to the single charge. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and Burnley midfielder was charged following an incident in the tunnel after the League One match, which ended in a 4-2 victory for the home team. Barton was granted unconditional bail by Judge Jeremy Richardson.
