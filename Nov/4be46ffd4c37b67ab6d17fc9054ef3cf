Sarah Hall is one of our most influential short story writers. Echoes of her dark magic realism, eco-apocalyptic landscapes, coolly sexual heroines and coiled, restrained, blackly ironic narrative voices are everywhere in the work of emerging writers such as Nicole Flattery and Julia Armfield. Her 2017 collection Madame Zero was electrifying: a taut, defiant body of stories that evoked in glorious prose the animal in us all, and took us, in tale after tale, to the edge of what makes us human. So this new collection is much anticipated, and when it opens, as Madame Zero did, with the story of a transforming woman, we brace ourselves for another terrifying ride. At first, it seems to deliver. Here are the careful, sensual descriptions, like those that changed a young wife into a vixen in the award-winning “Mrs Fox”. A lawyer becomes a harpy: there is “a crack behind her, huge and dull and viscose as the wings extend, unfurl and are filled, begin her flight”. Here is the crisp use of the present tense; the single-word, rhythmic sentences; and the violence. “Accident. A broken neck. And no post-mortem to reveal the delicately evacuated heart.” This time, though, the story is told from the point of view of the transforming person, and she is allowed feelings, pity for her lover, plans and even a little exposition. Soon, she is functioning within a recognisable moral scheme: transformed by her own womanly pain and motivated by other women’s pain. Mrs Fox, on the other hand, became a fox because, thrillingly, she just did, and alarmingly, mightn’t we all? The imagery becomes gloriously florid, the observation acute, the dialogue hilarious, the action fluid The following story is, by Hall’s standards, downright soothing. A man in a Turkish resort follows a young woman and recognises in her the child that he once knew. The landscape is full of light and beautifully realised, but tension is lacking because the protagonist is, startlingly for a Hall story, almost entirely benign. Another story set in Turkey, a fable set round a sacred well, takes us back into her familiar darkness – “the water is so cold it can shatter bones; it can sting the brain and seize the heart within a minute” – but here again the tale is contained, rescued, this time by storytelling women who seem to be making an intervention on the right side of history. Moral reasoning has even touched Hall’s famously savage portrayals of sex. The elderly protagonist of “Orton” is gifted with memories of alfresco intercourse to set beside the disinhibited love-making of Evie in Madame Zero. This woman is also fitted out with one of Hall’s usually fiendish futuristic machines – this time, a pacemaker that you can arrange to have turned off when you are ready to die. The combination of sex and machine, though, leads to a more reassuring conclusion. Whereas Evie’s gorging on sex turns out to have a disturbing basis – a brain tumour – here the protagonist is reconciling herself to death and answering that familiar question: what was the finest moment of your life? Two apparently autobiographical stories at the end of the collection seem to account for this softening. In “Sudden Traveller” a woman with a baby watches her father and brother dig her mother’s grave and considers what stories are for: “the currency of past lives. Families, lovers, enemies, friends. We are all of us sudden travellers in the world, blind, passing each other, reaching out, missing, sometimes taking hold.” The story provides an elegant, moving series of reflections but it is static in both time and space, as is the next piece, “Live that You May Live”, where a young mother tells her sleepless daughter tales about magical birds and similarly hopes that stories will anchor her in time. “She is another story, not this story … She is not mine … They will wind her forward every night … They are coming on white, definite wings.” But Hall is at her best when she lets her stories displace us in time; when they reveal gaps, not connections, between people. “The Grotesques”, for instance, makes magnificent play of a mother who fails to let her daughter tell her own story: “Mummy could change a story or revise history with astonishing audacity.” As a result, the adult Dilly finds herself hapless, tottering around a rainy Cambridge on her birthday, wondering if she will be allowed to eat a scone at tea, and how to explain to her family about Charlie-bo, a sleeping homeless man who has had fruit arranged over him by students. As soon as she is dealing only with dreadful people – cruel undergraduates, a scapegoating, utterly English family who wear each other’s dressing gowns and have no proper boundaries, a terrible clergyman – Hall lets go of the grandeur and stasis that weigh down parts of this collection. The imagery becomes gloriously florid, the observation acute, the dialogue hilarious, the action fluid, and the ending shocking yet wholly inevitable. The story is also, it is true, appalling: a vertiginous vista to the very depths of humanity. It is not comfortable on this edge, and it is easy to understand why Hall has retreated from it a little. Harsh as it may be, though, I can’t help but hope that this exceptional writer will go back to that verge soon. • Kate Clanchy’s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me is published by Picador.
