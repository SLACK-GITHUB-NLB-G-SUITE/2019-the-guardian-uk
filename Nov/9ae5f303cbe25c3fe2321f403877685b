Charlton owner Roland Duchâtelet has agreed to sell his stake in the Championship club to East Street Investments. The 73-year-old Belgian’s unpopular spell in charge of the Addicks will come to an end if the deal is approved by the Football League. East Street Investments chairman Matt Southall said in a statement: “We are privileged to take ownership of such an historic club and it is incredibly exciting to be part of the process of building a fresh future for the fans, loyal club staff and players of Charlton Athletic. “While we may be the club owners, truly we are only the custodians. The true spirit of this football club rests with the fans, it is nothing without them. Their support throughout some difficult times both recently and in the past has been inspirational and we intend to build on that loyalty. “Our priority will be immediate contact with fan groups in order that their views play a major role in the club going forward. We believe the football side of the club is in excellent hands with Lee Bowyer and what he and the players have achieved following promotion has been outstanding. We will do everything possible to support Lee’s vision and ambitions. “We would like to thank Roland Duchâtelet, his team and the directors for helping to facilitate a quick and smooth sale. They leave the club with solid foundations on which we can invest and build.”
