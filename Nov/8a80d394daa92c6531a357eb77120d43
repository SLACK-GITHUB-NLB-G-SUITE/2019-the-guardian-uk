I am a recently divorced 55-year-old woman in physically good shape. After a virtually sexless marriage, I recently started seeing someone who has turned out to be an amazing lover. So far so good, except sex has taken over my life. He lives at the other end of the country, which means we can spend only every other week together, but when we do, we’ll have sex as many as seven or eight times a day. He is in his 50s, too, and I really don’t know how he does it – there’s no Viagra involved. But I have no complaints. Should I just go with it or try to get my mania for sex under some sort of control? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
