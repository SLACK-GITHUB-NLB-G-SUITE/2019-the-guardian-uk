That Question Time debate. I switched off halfway through. Put some music on. Channel hopped. Went on Twitter. Wrote some emails. In other words, I am fairly average and this election makes me flit between anger, frustration and boredom. I don’t care if I never see Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn make another speech. Sorry. But Nicola Sturgeon is impressive, isn’t she? She answers questions, even if people don’t like the answers. She seems as if she might get stuff done; the sort of woman who can negotiate. Can I vote for her? I support Scottish independence, but several of the people who told me how much they admired her after the debate don’t share this view. They just found her a grownup. Visibly competent. It’s almost as if she gets it. Indeed, in the 2015 general election leadership debates, she opened with: “I know it’s not just people in Scotland who feel let down by Westminster politics.” How right she was – and that was before the Brexit referendum. However acrimonious the Scottish independence referendum had been in 2014 – and I don’t pretend it wasn’t – after that 2015 leaders’ debate, one of the most searched-for terms on Google was whether people in non-Scottish consituencies could vote for the SNP. Astonishing really. I felt much the same on Friday night. Sturgeon wants another independence referendum. Corbyn says she can’t have it – but she knows she could get him to change his mind. And she will outlast him, let’s be honest. She speaks more passionately against the Tories than he does. Sturgeon also has what so many politicians lack. Hinterland. Johnson’s is – well, Latin and more children than he can count. Corbyn’s is jam today and tomorrow. Sturgeon reads, laughs, connects and does not suffer fools gladly. Maybe it’s time to move to Scotland while the rest of this country gets its house in order.
