Uber has lost its licence to operate in London over passenger safety concerns. Transport for London (TfL) claimed Uber’s systems let unauthorised drivers to access the accounts of other drivers allowing them to pick up passengers, which happened on 14,000 trips. The company has 21 days to appeal the decision during which it can still operate. TfL said on Monday it had identified a “pattern of failures” by Uber, including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk.
