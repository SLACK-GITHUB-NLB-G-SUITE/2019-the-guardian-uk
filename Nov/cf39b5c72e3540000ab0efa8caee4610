Conor O’Shea, who resigned as the Italy coach this month, will join the Rugby Football Union as the director of performance rugby next year. “I am privileged and honoured and it is an incredible opportunity to join at a really exciting time for English rugby,” the 49-year-old, who was previously the director of rugby at Harlequins, said. “There is an exciting vision at the RFU. It is not just about winning tomorrow, but also about sustaining success and winning long into the future. We can really look forward to rejuvenating and re-energising performance to help, support and push England rugby on.” Nigel Melville is to step down as the RFU’s director of professional rugby in December. Melville, who joined the governing body in July 2016, has opted to pursue new opportunities. “I am proud of all that the organisation has achieved over the last three years during some challenging times,” he said. “I believe England Rugby is in a great place and that leaving after the World Cup is the right time as the RFU start a new era and prepare for the next World Cup cycle.” During Melville’s tenure, Eddie Jones’s England reached the World Cup final in Japan where they were beaten by South Africa. The 58-year-old also acted as the RFU’s interim chief executive in the first half of 2019, ahead of Bill Sweeney’s arrival in May. Sweeney said: “On behalf of everyone at the RFU, I would like to thank Nigel for his valuable contribution. His professionalism and knowledge of rugby and sport is outstanding and he will be missed. In particular, I am grateful for the support he has given to me since I joined. He leaves with our very best wishes for the future.”
