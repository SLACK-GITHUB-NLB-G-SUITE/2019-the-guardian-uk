The Queen will host Donald Trump at Buckingham Palace when the US president travels to the UK early next month just before the general election, the White House has said. Trump and his wife, Melania, will be among the world leaders and their partners attending an event at the palace as part of a Nato summit. The couple will be in the UK from 2 to 4 December.The election is on 12 December. Trump has faced large-scale demonstrations on his two previous visits to London as president. Next month will be the second time he has met the Queen. He has regularly expressed concern that many Nato members are not providing sufficient financial support for the military alliance. A White House statement said: “Seventy years after its founding, Nato remains the most successful alliance in history, guaranteeing the security, prosperity and freedom of its members. President Trump looks forward to meeting with the other Nato heads of state and government to review the alliance’s unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than $100bn in new defence spending since 2016. “The president will also emphasise the need for the Nato alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow, including those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism.”
