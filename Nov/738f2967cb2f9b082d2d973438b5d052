Bow Barracks was an army mess built in my home town of Kolkata during the first world war. This is a pretty simple, classic gimlet, but it’s made with ginger syrup to give it some spice – if you don’t want to make your own syrup, use the syrup from a jar of stem ginger instead. Serves 1 For the ginger syrup100g caster sugar100ml water4 tbsp peeled and grated fresh ginger For the drink2 tbsp gin - we use Bombay Sapphire1 tsp freshly squeezed lime juice2 tbsp ginger syrup (see above)1 thin slice fresh lime, to garnish First make the syrup. Put the sugar, water and ginger in a pan, bring to a slow boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. While it’s still warm, strain through a fine sieve into a clean, sterilised jar, filling it right to the top, then seal. It will now keep for three months in a cool place. To make the drink, pour everything bar the lime slice in a shaker, add ice and shake hard for 10 seconds. Strain into chilled tumblers filled with ice, garnish and serve. • Harneet Baweja, Gunpowder London.
