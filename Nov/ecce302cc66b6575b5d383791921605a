An endurance athlete from Dorset has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world after completing a 26.2 mile race in Athens. Nick Butter set off on his mission to run the famous distance in all 196 United Nations-recognised countries on 6 January 2018, finishing with the Athens classic marathon on Sunday. He has raised more than £65,000 for Prostate Cancer UK. The 22-month challenge was inspired by Kevin Webber, who Butter describes as having had “a huge impact on me and how I live my life”. Webber, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014, joined the ultra runner as he completed his 196th marathon. “The feeling of crossing that finish line was like many other finish lines, in the sense that I’m tired and I want a drink and want to be go bed,” Butter said in Athens. “The elation of finishing that run with Kevin and everyone else behind me was just so amazing. I wasn’t really sure what I was going to feel like when I finished. “I feel a bit numb, I’m not really sure what’s going to happen next and I am so, so ready to chat with Kev and have a proper conversation about everything that’s happened in the last few years because we haven’t had time to catch up.”
