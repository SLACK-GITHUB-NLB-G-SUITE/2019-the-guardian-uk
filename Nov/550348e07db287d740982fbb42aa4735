Two men and a woman were shot dead on Monday outside a Walmart store in Oklahoma, the local chief of police said. One man and the woman were shot inside a car and the second man was in the parking lot outside the store in Duncan, police chief Danny Ford said, adding that police were looking for witnesses. Police said in a Facebook post that a handgun was found at the scene. Earlier, a dispatcher told the Associated Press “everyone is at the scene”. Duncan public schools were placed on lockdown. No staff members were involved in the shooting and the store was not evacuated, Walmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said in an email. “This was an isolated incident in the parking lot and was not an active shooter situation,” Jenkins said. Duncan is about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City.
