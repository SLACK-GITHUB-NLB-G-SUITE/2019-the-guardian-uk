A woman has been charged with attempted homicide in a Pittsburgh stabbing that critically injured former NFL player Terrelle Pryor, who is facing a separate charge, police said. Pryor was taken to the hospital just after 4.30am on Saturday following a dispute with “mutual combatants” in an apartment on the city’s North Side, police said. Shalaya Briston, 24, was charged with attempted homicide and aggravated assault, while Pryor, 30, faces a charge of simple assault. Gregory Diulus of Vantage Management Group, who represent Pryor, said family members had been told Pryor is expected to make a full recovery. Diulus said he expects to see Pryor on Sunday. After Pryor’s successful college career at Ohio State ended in 2011, he spent time with nine NFL teams including the Buffalo Bills, New York Jets, Washington and Cleveland Browns. He most recently signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars but was waived in September after a hamstring injury. Pryor was a national star in high school, and was considered one of the top young players in the country when he signed with the Buckeyes in 2008. He played as a quarterback in college, and in the early stages of his NFL career, before switching to wide receiver.
