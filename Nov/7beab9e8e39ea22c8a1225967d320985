You will need 2 thick pieces of cod or haddock fillet, each weighing about 250g. Peel 3 plump cloves of garlic, crush them flat with the side of a heavy knife, then put them into a mortar or small food processor. Dry 25g of anchovy fillets with kitchen paper to remove the excess salt and oil, then crush the garlic and anchovy to a coarse paste with a pestle or a brief pulse of the processor. Blend in 4 tbsp of olive oil then add, without further crushing, 2 tsp of small “Lilliput” capers and the leaves from 6 sprigs of thyme. Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 6. Place the fish a little apart in a shallow baking dish, and spread with the caper and garlic paste, rolling the fish over once or twice to coat each side. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until the surface of the fish is turning a pale gold. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the fish as it comes from the oven. Serve with green beans and perhaps some steamed, floury-fleshed potatoes. Enough for 2. By crushing each clove of garlic flat before putting it into the mortar you make it easier to work them into a paste with the other ingredients. If you use anchovy fillets in oil, check the label for sourcing information. Adjust the cooking time according to the thickness of the fish. The timing here is for thick pieces of fish. You will need to reduce the time for a cut from the tail. The punchy anchovy and thyme paste is good for both white fish and shellfish, such as hake or scallops, and for oily fish, such as tuna. It is very fine with prawns, too, especially those cooked with their shells on, tossed with the paste as they come from the grill. I should mention that I have used it to season a bunch of steamed purple sprouting, too.
