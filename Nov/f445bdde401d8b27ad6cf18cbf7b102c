Moise Kean’s difficult start to his career at Everton continues after it emerged the striker was dropped from the squad for a breach of club rules. It is understood that the £27m summer signing from Juventus was omitted from the matchday 18 for the win at Southampton on Saturday after being late for a team meeting. It was the second time Marco Silva, the manager, had an issue with Kean’s timekeeping and as a result the forward, who travelled with the squad to the south coast, was punished. Asked at Southampton why Kean had been omitted Silva, who received an apology from the player, would only say it was “a decision, just decision”. Kean has started just four matches this season, two in the Premier League and two in the Carabao Cup, although in his last appearance he was substituted at half-time against Watford. The striker has yet to score in the 11 games in which he has featured and has managed just nine shots, only one of which was on target, and one assist in 288 minutes of top-flight action.
