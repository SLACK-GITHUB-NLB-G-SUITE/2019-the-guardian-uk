Unstoppable in qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen has a pole position he now will dearly want to convert into a victory after a win was snatched from his grasp in the same race last year. The Red Bull driver was rightly pleased with a performance of control and pace to take the top spot but acknowledged the task is to complete the job. Despite his form at Interlagos, victory is never a given. Although this is the first time he has qualified in the top three at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, Verstappen has great form at this track, including a standout performance in the wet in 2016. Last year he had also driven a superb race and was comfortably leading when he was struck and spun by Esteban Ocon who was attempting to unlap himself, costing the Dutchman the win. The two exchanged words and a spot of pushing and shoving afterwards. Verstappen was furious but has the opportunity to put it behind him with victory on Sunday. He put himself in the best place to do so with a commanding performance. The car, he said, had been “on fire”, a welcome change from the majority of races where it has struggled against the power of Mercedes and Ferrari. “The car was flying and really enjoyable to drive. I’m really happy with this pole,” he said. “I’ll try to finish it off.” The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, acknowledged his performance. “He just got the car really hooked up and the whole package has been working really well,” he said. “It was brilliant from him.” Verstappen’s rivals certainly had no answer as Ferrari’s’ Sebastian Vettel was held to second and Lewis Hamilton third, both over a 10th back. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was in fourth but will receive a 10-place grid penalty for taking a new engine. Valtteri Bottas was fifth for Mercedes, in front of Red Bull’s Alexander Albon. Verstappen’s pole lap had pushed the Red Bull to the limit across the testing, short, bumpy challenge of Interlagos. He set the quickest time of 1min 07.623sec on his first run in Q3, despite going wide at Pinheirinho. He was just eight-hundredths in front of Vettel but there was more to come from Verstappen who put it together perfectly on his final run. Controlling it on the limit through the first left-hand corner of Descida do Lago he was inch-perfect as he nailed the exit of Junção. His last lap of 1.07.508 was immaculate, the Red Bull proving almost untouchable through the corners of the middle sector. This is his second pole of the year but his first at the Brazilian Grand Prix and further redemption after he took the top spot in Mexico but was penalised places for failing to slow behind yellow flags. This time he made no such error, as was required with a tightly fought competition for third in the championship at stake. With two races remaining Leclerc holds third on 249 points, 14 in front of Verstappen, with Vettel a further five points back in fifth. For Red Bull it is an fine result even given that they expected their car to perform well in Brazil. They found a superb set-up for the circuit and their Honda engine was impressive despite the high altitude of Interlagos. A win is not guaranteed, however; the long runs of the Mercedes in practice suggested that once more they may have the better car as regards race pace. Verstappen will need to take every advantage he can in starting at the front to dictate the race and ensure this time he stays well clear of anything that may end in another case of fractious frustration. Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly was in seventh, Romain Grosjean in eight for Haas, with his teammate Kevin Magnussen in tenth. Kimi Raikkonen was ninth for Alfa Romeo. Lando Norris was in 11th for McLaren, with Daniel Ricciardo in 12th for Renault and his teammate Nico HÃ¼lkenberg in 14th. Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi was 13th, with Sergio PÃ©rez in 15th for Racing Point. McLaren’s Carlos Sainz was unable to set a time after an engine problem in Q1 and was placed 20th. Daniil Kvyat was in 16th for Toro Rosso, in front of the Racing Point of Lance Stroll. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 18th and 19th for Williams.
