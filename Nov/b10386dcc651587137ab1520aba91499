Everton head to St Mary’s for the first of two games with teams below them and a win essential if they are to tackle a difficult December in anything like good heart. Marco Silva, who has been less than strident in making his team’s case against controversial VAR decisions in the last two games – two penalties denied against Spurs, a shocker awarded to Brighton – and arguably costing his team five points in what is becoming an increasingly difficult season, will have to reshape the midfield again, with André Gomes joining Jean-Philippe Gbamin on the long-term injury list. Ralph Hasenhüttl has his own problems, winless in the league at home and desperate to rebuild confidence after their 9-0 shellacking by Leicester, though he has Moussa Djenepo available to start for the first time in weeks.
