Whether you’re a fashion, music, design or art hunter, please tell us about great places to go in the UK and Europe to shop for vintage and retro goodies. We’d love to hear about wonderful shops and stalls where it’s all about quality and rarities. Include any shopowners or stall holders you’ve met along the way who are full of good advice. Give details exact locations and how to get there if it’s not obvious. We’d rather hear about specific outlets or stalls on this occasion than entire markets. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
