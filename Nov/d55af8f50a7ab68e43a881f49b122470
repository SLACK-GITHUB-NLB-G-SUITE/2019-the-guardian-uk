Travel books not only broaden the mind and provide inspiration for your own dream journey, they can transport you to another world. From Xenophon through Marco Polo to Robert Macfarlane via Dervla Murphy and Paul Theroux, travel literature has been exciting imaginations for centuries. Tell us about your favourite travel book, perhaps the one that has most chimed with your own experiences. You might have visited a place on the back of something you’ve read and found it to be completely different, perhaps even more bizarre or everything you’d dreamed of. Share details of the book that opened your eyes to somewhere new or inspired you to take a trip. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com. Competition closes Tuesday 3 December 2019, 10am GMT If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
