We’re interested in finding out more about why people enter into marriages of convenience to hide their sexuality. So-called lavender marriages are when male and female partners of different sexual orientations marry to hide their sexuality. The colour lavender was associated with homosexuality at the end of the 19th century and Hollywood adopted the term to describe such marriages, to help gay and bisexual actors maintain the pretence they were heterosexual. Despite the progress of the LGBT equality movement since then, people enter marriages of convenience for cultural and religious reasons amongst others. The BBC have reported on a growing number of LGBT people from South Asian communities committing to marriages of convenience with gay partners of the opposite sex to hide their sexuality from their families. We want to understand more about the different reasons why people enter into these relationships. We would like to hear about your experiences of being in a marriage of convenience in detail. What is your sexuality? Why did you commit to this marriage? Did you know your partner well before the wedding? Why have you found it difficult to express your sexuality to friends and family? Do you have children with your partner or are you planning on having kids together? What are the pros and cons of living in this type of relationship?
