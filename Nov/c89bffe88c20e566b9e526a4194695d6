Occasionally in this job, you meet someone extraordinary. And they’re not always the fastest or the strongest, their voices not always the most booming. Last Friday, 17-year-old Faizah Hashmi walked to the front of the lecture theatre at Huddersfield University for the Women in Sport North Awards, smiled, and told the room how nervous she was. She paused, took a deep breath, and spoke: “Many of you may have heard of the proverb or saying ‘the calm after the storm’. It signifies the period in one’s life or situation during which things improve after a difficult, chaotic or stressful time. “I believe in the Qur’an, every line, every sentence can be dissected into deeper meaning. ‘Verily with hardship comes ease’ … This is my story of how cricket saved my life.” For five or six minutes, the room listened in stillness as she nakedly, lyrically, described her descent into anorexia. The angry despair, the endless fight, the guilt and the secret pleasure, the lies and the secrecy, and then her path away from its clutches. Hashmi grew up in Birmingham in the arms of a loving family and discovered cricket when coaches came into her primary school in years five and six, and she joined Kingsheath Cricket Club. She had numerous diagnoses, including Asperger’s, but her anxiety about food was triggered when she was weighed in Year Six (as part of the NHS national child measurement programme) and a letter was sent home saying that she was overweight. She started to diet, first of all with the blessing of her family, and as the pounds fell away, so the praise grew. She began to skip meals and then started to research eating disorders and realised what an important part exercise had to play in weight loss – which quickly turned into over-exercising, taking the longest possible route between any two points, doing extra time in the gym, standing when she could sit, pulling, as Hashmi says, “every trick in the book”. Cricket, something that been such a positive part of her life, soon became a numbers game – a race against water, time and calories. Exercise stretched into an obsession and as her health dipped and her anorexia got worse she had three spells in hospital – the first for six months, the second for nine and the third, in the Priory, where she went for her own safety as she was actively suicidal, for another six. Times were dark. And yet, breath by breath, something started to shift. The doctors in her second hospital told her that exercise wasn’t forbidden and, after coming out of the Priory, she was allowed to play cricket again. She wasn’t quite ready for the competitiveness of Kingsheath, so her coach, Asma Ajaz-Ali, recommended Moseley CC, part of the south-Asian cricket league. It was the most important step on her road to recovery, a safe space with people from a similar cultural background. “It was the nicest thing, they weren’t competitive, they enjoyed what they were doing and when people made mistakes they laughed and that struck me as so fun. I developed for the first time a real love of the game.” She concentrated on getting stronger but also, most importantly, understanding that it was OK to stop. The gentle practice sessions gradually grew into a team playing regular cricket, and this summer she was appointed captain. She also started volunteering as a coach on the ECB’s All Stars programme and blossomed working with young children. Mental health issues are even more of a taboo subject among the south Asian community than in the wider populace. Monty Panesar is one of very few British Asian sportspeople to have spoken out about his struggles – in fact the ECB is training 2,000 south-Asian women as volunteer coaches and mental health is part of that training. The Time to Change report of 2010 concluded that mental health was rarely discussed in south Asian communities because of the need to “preserve reputation and status at all costs”. Hashmi, like many others, suffered feelings of shame and found it difficult to speak to family members outside her immediate circle about how she was feeling. “As a Muslim, we are taught to look at the positives in life, but when I was very ill I was very depressed and very negative and it was hard for everyone to deal with.” Hashmi’s mum, Maira, grew up in the UK but her father, Nadeem, was brought up in Pakistan and he found the depression particularly difficult, telling her to snap out of it and lifting her out of bed when she felt she couldn’t get up. But two, three years on, and countless episodes of family therapy later, her dad’s attitude has completely changed, and the family are closer than ever. Hashmi is transformed, and happy to be alive. She has restarted school and is currently revising for her GCSE mocks, training with Moseley twice a week and looking forward to winter nets with Kingsheath. She’s even pondering over whether she should get her bowling speed measured, as she is pretty sure she’s got quicker. Life, as ever, can be a complete bastard. The family had bad news recently when Maira was diagnosed with breast cancer, but that has only increased Hashmi’s determination to get better. “I want to keep well for her, she’s so strong, she’s my rock and I don’t know what I’d do without her.” And with that she’s off back to her books, a reminder of sport’s transformative powers at all levels, so much bigger and more valuable than all the baubles and bulging wallets of success.
