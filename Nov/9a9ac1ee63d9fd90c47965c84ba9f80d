Turkey qualified for the Euro 2020 finals with a goalless draw in their Group H game against Iceland in Istanbul â€“ with the result also ensuring France a place in the championship. Iceland needed to beat Turkey to stay in the running for direct entry into the tournament. Hordur Magnusson came close for Iceland near the end but his effort from a corner was blocked on the line Merih Demiral. Burak Yilmaz headed over in the first-half but otherwise Turkey were mostly restricted to long-range efforts. They joined Belgium, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain and Ukraine as the teams who have already qualified for the tournament that will be staged across 12 European countries from 12 June to 12 July 2020.
