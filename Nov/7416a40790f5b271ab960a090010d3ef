Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley could scarcely have wished to make a better first impression on their first day for England, compiling promising centuries such that their captain, Joe Root, spent a good chunk of it waiting in the pavilion. England’s plan in Test cricket under their new head coach, Chris Silverwood, sees Root back at No 4 and it is hoped that a top three reinforced by the obdurate Sibley can stop – or at least significantly reduce – his early arrivals at the crease. And so the batting day of this initial warm-up against a New Zealand XI in Whangarei made a satisfying early run-out ahead of next week’s first Test, even if the opposition and the occasion were considerably more low key. After a rain-delayed 2.30pm start, Root did not emerge until the final session, when Sibley had retired on 100 from 161 balls, before making a sprightly 42 not out. With Crawley walking off upon reaching 103 from 137, and Rory Burns the only genuine wicket to fall for 23, England finished 283 for three. While Crawley was deputising for the injured Joe Denly ahead of his expected return for Friday’s three-day first-class match against New Zealand A – leaving Jonny Bairstow on the bench in this 13-a-side match – his partner in a stand of 154 is inked in for debut in Mount Maunganui. Both spoke after play, with Crawley describing it as “great fun” (while recognising his place behind Denly in the queue) and Sibley outlining his intention to take a “fearless” approach into international cricket. That word might suggest a departure from the approach that got him this far – 1,324 runs in Division One last summer while soaking up 1,009 more balls than the next most adhesive batsman – but should not be misconstrued. It instead refers to a change in crucial change in mindset by a player who, back in 2013 aged 18, became the youngest batsman to score a double century in the County Championship but stalled thereafter. It needed a move from Surrey to Warwickshire two years ago to become the run-hungry opener he is today. “I didn’t live up to the early hype,” said Sibley. “At times I played the bowler too much. I played against guys with big reputations and didn’t back myself. Moving away from my family and growing up made a big difference. I don’t really fear too many people now, I just try to back myself and know that if I get through a tough time it always gets easier at some stage.” Asked if he would take this approach into facing the likes of Trent Boult and Tim Southee next week, Sibley replied: “I think you’ve got to respect these guys and look what they’re trying to do and analyse how they’re going to try to get you out. But at the same time don’t fear them.” Such respect was afforded to less decorated opposition at Cobham Oval. Sibley, who bats front on and is a physical presence at the crease, saw off 22 successive dot balls against the seamers early on, waited for his 60th ball before driving his first four and reached 50 from 109 with a tucked single. The right-hander’s one six, struck straight off the left-arm spin of Theo van Woerkom, was still a percentage shot with the field up. And while he picked up the pace to reach three-figures later on, this was a controlled, chanceless and hugely encouraging display. Crawley, who at 6ft 5in is fractionally taller than Sibley and wirier with it, was similarly patient at first. The Kent right-hander took 16 balls to get off the mark and though he offered one chance to short leg on 11 – and brought up his half-century with a streaky four past slip – there was a touch of class too. When the 21-year-old lofted the spinner over his head for a 13th boundary and a first century in the whites of England he did so with Root watching on from the other end. Not a bad way to introduce yourself to your new captain.
