If Boris Johnson does indeed duck an interview with Andrew Neil (Labour concerned Johnson will duck Andrew Neil TV interview, 28 November) then, in the interests of fairness, he should be “empty-chaired”. Mr Neil should let us know the questions he would have grilled Mr Johnson on: perhaps Russia, Ms Arcuri, his “oven-ready Brexit deal” which is no such thing, Islamophobia, or the prorogation of parliament, to mention just a few. Above all Mr Neil and the BBC must resist the temptation to negotiate any sort of deal restricting what can be asked just to get the PM on the show, in order to create what would actually be a totally false semblance of balance.Adrian CoskerHitchin, Hertfordshire • If Boris Johnson is bottling out of cross-examination by Andrew Neil, maybe to give an impression of impartiality, rather than an empty chair, the BBC should arrange for Neil to interview Johnson’s Spitting Image puppet (Spitting Image: Political chaos is back, and so are the puppets, 28 September).Ruth LewisMiddlesbrough, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
