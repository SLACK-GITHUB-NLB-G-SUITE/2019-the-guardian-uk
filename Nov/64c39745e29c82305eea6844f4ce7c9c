Last week Boris Johnson said he had seen “no evidence … of any Russian interference in UK democratic processes” (Report, 21 November). But three days later, Jeffrey A Stacey, a former US state department official, wrote in the New York Times that the Conservative party entered this election campaign “flush with Russian donations”. The government has declined to publish an official report on Russian interference. It should come clean.Prof James ManorInstitute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London • Boris Johnson is keen on his Brexit deal, but I worry that if we follow his instructions, we will all end up somewhat bilious – an “oven-ready” deal that you can just “ping … in the microwave” is more than a mixed metaphor, it’s a recipe for disaster.Russell BealeBletchley, Shropshire • More questions than answers in your summing up of Dr Aaron Spitz’s work: we’re told athletes’ erections were “up to 13.5% firmer” after a vegetarian burrito (Shortcuts, G2, 26 November). It seems very precise. And how is this quality measured?Ed CollardWest Bridgford, Nottinghamshire • There have been many references recently to the end of the decade, including in your “quiz of the decade” (Weekend, 23 November). But the decade will not end until 31 December 2020. I seem to remember a similar misunderstanding in 1999.Cherry WestonWolverhampton • Re moths (Letters, 26 November), a man walks into a butchers. Man: “Can you help me? I think I’m a moth.” Butcher: “You’d be better off at the psychiatrist next door.” Man: “Yes, I know, but your light was on.”Michael CunninghamWolverhampton • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
