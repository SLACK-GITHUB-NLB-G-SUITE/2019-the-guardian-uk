I was discussing with friends Saturday’s “How I spend it” on the train into London (Money, 23 November). Patrick Lawson’s story of learning how to manage his money after many years of hardship and struggle was a real piece of positive news. His new achievement as London’s happiest bus driver had come from his commitment to service and engaging with passengers. At Liverpool Street we jumped on the 26 bus to go to the South Bank and, to our amazement, there was Patrick himself beaming and welcoming his customers. He was delighted to see his story in the Guardian (he didn’t know it was there) and shared his pleasure with the whole bus, who were clearly enjoying his informative, good-humoured and friendly style. We decided that in future we would all try to be a bit more like Patrick.Jonathan SeathColchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
