The empty doorway series has told the life stories of homeless people who have lost their lives in UK cities. The people featured in this series, from Aimee Teese, the 30-year-old mother of one who died alone in her tent in Liverpool city centre to Gyula Remes, the 43-year-old cook who died on parliament’s doorstep, have all been let down by somebody at some point in their lives. Austerity is strongly linked to the year-on-year rise of homelessness in the UK and when you look into the lives of homeless people, especially entrenched rough sleepers, you’d be forgiven for thinking that nothing short of a miracle would allow them to reach for a better life. And yet, some do manage to get their lives back together. It’s those people who we would like to speak to. If you have been homeless, but are now in your own home, we’d like to know how you got there. Was it because of the help you received from a stranger, a friend, relative or charity? Or did you get off the street through sheer strength of your own will? Perhaps you have changed your circumstances in another way? If you’d like to share your experiences for the series then please get in touch. If you were homeless but now in your own home we would like to hear from you.
