Jewellery worth more than £1m has been stolen in a “brazen” heist from a mansion in north London. An unknown number of suspects broke into the property in Hampstead Lane in Haringey at about 5pm last Thursday , while a woman in her 30s and her children were inside, police said. The burglars escaped from a window on the first floor with various items including “distinctive and rare” jewellery, designer clothing and a large amount of cash. The average value of property on Hampstead Lane is estimated to be £6,207,674, according to the real estate website Zoopla. Police appealed to the public to get in touch if they witnessed anything in relation to the burglary. DI Paul Ridley, who is leading the investigation, said: “Burglary is an extremely intrusive crime and the effect is often compounded further when the occupants are at home. “This is an aggravating feature of this case as the victim was present with her young children when the burglars forced entry, scaling the wall of the mansion and brazenly ransacking the premises. “I am today releasing images of some of the items that were stolen and are of huge sentimental value to the victim. “Many of of these are very distinctive and rare, including the necklace, ring and earrings. I would ask anyone who has been offered this jewellery, including private collectors or jewellers, or seen these items for sale anywhere, to report it to us immediately.”
