More than 6,000 homes across the UK still have black and white television licences, half a century after the advent of colour on the BBC. According to the latest figures published by TV Licensing, London leads the way with 1,311 black and white permits, followed by Birmingham with 323 and Manchester with 245. Published on the 50th anniversary of colour television on BBC One, the figures show there were 6,586 black and white licences at the end of September this year – a fall of 575 from September 2018 and down from 212,000 at the turn of the millennium. Paul Cooper, a TV Licensing spokesman, said: “When BBC One launched its colour TV service in November 1969, there were only three channels available. Fast-forward to 2019, and more than half (53%) of TV households have in some way an internet connection to their TV and access to hundreds of channels. “Whilst only accounting for a very small proportion, it’s interesting to know that some households still like to watch their favourite shows on a black and white telly.” Black and white televisions remain popular with collectors, with vintage and portable TV sets regularly traded online. The black and white annual licence costs £52 – one-third of the £154.50 for colour.
