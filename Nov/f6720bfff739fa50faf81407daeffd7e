Pete Doherty has reportedly been arrested in Paris for the second time in 48 hours. The Libertines and Babyshambles frontman was initially arrested in the Pigalle district in the early hours of Friday for allegedly attempting to buy cocaine. He spent two days in police custody and was provisionally fined the equivalent of £4,300, a sentence yet to be approved by a judge, the Mail reports. Doherty, 40, reportedly went out on Sunday wearing his pyjamas to celebrate his release. He was allegedly seen fighting in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district with a 19-year-old male, who is believed to have filed a police complaint. Doherty faces new charges for violence by a person in a state of drunkenness. Arash Derambarsh, a lawyer for Doherty, told the Mail: “[Pete wanted to] go and celebrate his liberation in a bar near him. He drank and people made him drink.” The Libertines are due to start a European tour in Luxembourg on 17 November. Representatives for Doherty told the Guardian that his arrests should not affect the tour schedule.
