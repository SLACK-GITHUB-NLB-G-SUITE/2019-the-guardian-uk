Two 15-year-olds and a woman who sent a final text message to her family have been named as some of the people found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex. Police have released the names of all 39 people who were discovered in the refrigerated lorry in Grays last month. Among the names were two 15-year-old boys, Dinh Dinh Binh from Hai Phong and Nguyen Huy Hung from Ha Tinh, as well as 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a final text message home saying she could not breathe. Police said 10 teenagers, including the two 15-year-old boys, were among the victims. There were eight women among the 39 who died, with the oldest victim aged 44. Tim Smith, assistant chief constable and senior officer in overall charge of the inquiry, said: “This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores. “Our priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims’ friends and families. It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual’s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one’s identity.” In Ireland, police from the state Criminal Assets Bureau raided the homes and business premises of two Irish men suspected of involvement in the deaths. Gardai seized several vehicles and other property. The suspects have reportedly been under investigation over alleged smuggling across the Irish border since last year – an investigation that preceded the discovery of the migrants’ bodies in Essex on 23 October.
