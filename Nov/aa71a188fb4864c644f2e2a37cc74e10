The Guardian will be reporting from Stevenage ahead of the General Election, as part of a series of pieces from across the country focused on finding out what matters to the people who live there. I’ll be covering the election from Stevenage for two main reasons. First, I grew up there. It’s my home town. Second, it is a classical bellwether constituency. For almost half a century Stevenage has always voted for whichever party became the government. As Stevenage goes so goes the country, so I’m going home - to Stevenage. If you live in Stevenage, can you tell us what will decide your vote? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. We’d also like to know how you are following this election, whether through traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups? We want to hear from people who live in Stevenage about the issues that matter to them in the upcoming election.
