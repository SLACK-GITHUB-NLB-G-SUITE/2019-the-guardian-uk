It’s nearly the most wonderful time of the year, but with gifts, wrapping, trees, more food, more lights, and journeys to see loved ones – it’s often the most conducive to carbon emissions for many. As awareness of the world’s climate emergency increases, more retailers are adapting their festive offerings to make them more sustainable. Waitrose is ditching plastic toys in their crackers, and last year upmarket department store Selfridges proudly flogged Iceland’s palm-oil-free mince pies. For those of you who celebrate Christmas in a traditional way, we want to hear if you’re taking measures in order to have a more eco-friendly Christmas in 2019. Are you giving plastic-free gifts – or any at all? Have you, or your community, ditched the Christmas lights this year? What are you doing instead? We would like to hear from people who are adapting their usual Christmas traditions this year for the benefit of the environment. To contribute, please fill in the encrypted form below.
