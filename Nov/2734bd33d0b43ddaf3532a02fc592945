Jeremy Corbyn’s resistance to issuing an apology amid allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party leads most of the front pages on Wednesday. Corbyn, who was questioned about the long-running issue by the BBC’s Andrew Neil, declined to apologise and rejected claims that antisemitism had risen in the party under his leadership. The Times’ splash headline is “Corbyn refuses to apologise”, while the Telegraph’s is only slightly different: “Corbyn refuses to apologise to Jews”.
