Hibernian have appointed Jack Ross as their new head coach, the club have announced. The former Alloa, St Mirren and Sunderland boss emerged as the early front-runner to replace Paul Heckingbottom and has now agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal. The 43-year-old’s immediate priority will be to lead Hibs away from trouble at the bottom end of the Premiership. Heckingbottom was sacked earlier this month after a wretched start to the season and Ross now inherits a squad perched only two points above the relegation play-off spot. “I think we all consider Hibernian to be one of the leading clubs in Scottish football – in terms of the history and passion of the supporters. It’s up to all of us to help the squad live up to that,” Ross said. “We have some talented players, underpinned by a successful academy, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure we’re able to help every player fulfil his potential.” Hibs’ sporting director, Graeme Mathie, said: “It became very clear early on in our discussions with Jack that he would be a great fit for Hibernian. His ideas for the game and the development of the club tie in with our own. “We want to give supporters a team that they are proud of, that will entertain them and, ultimately, help bring about the kind of days that live long in the memory.”
