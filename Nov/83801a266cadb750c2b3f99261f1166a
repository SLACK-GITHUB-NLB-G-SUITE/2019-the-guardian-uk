Great to see the call to architects and planners for potty parity (The queue for the ladies’ loo is a feminist issue, Journal, 14 November). Maybe we can also ask them to situate the pan off centre in each of the ladies’ cubicles, so the user’s thigh doesn’t have to have such a close relationship with the sanitary bin. Alison Whitehouse East Barnet, London • One place where I gleefully skip past a very long line of men queueing for the loo in the knowledge that my own wait will be considerably shorter is at Watford FC. The women’s loos there are spotlessly clean, provide free sanitary products, and, most intriguingly, no mirrors! They’re top of the league in my books.Liz O’ConnellSt Albans, Hertfordshire • The most tried-and-tested cure for a hangover was inexplicably overlooked (Best cures for hangovers – by pub landlords, G2, 14 November). Generations of experienced drinkers in Scotland will testify that nothing beats a glass or two of Irn-Bru. Mike PenderCardiff • As bribery now seems to be acceptable to influence those standing for election, I would like to offer a couple of weeks of free narrow boating to any old Etonian who wants to spend more time with their or anybody else’s family after 12 December.Ian Grieve Gordon Bennett, Llangollen canal • Olivia Colman describes the Queen as “the breadwinner” (Report, 12 November). That would be the bread from the civil list, I assume.Michael CunninghamWolverhampton • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
