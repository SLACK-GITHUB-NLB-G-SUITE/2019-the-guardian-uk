Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters did not suit up for Friday’s game against the Lakers in Los Angeles after experiencing what ESPN reported as a “panic attack” on the team plane after taking a THC-infused edible. According to the report, published Saturday night, Waiters received medical treatment upon the plane’s landing in Los Angeles and did not attend the game. He was listed as out due to illness. Radio station 640 AM reported Friday night that Waiters had some sort of a reaction to gummies.

Already struggling to break into the rotation, Waiters has yet to actually suit up for a game and, according to ESPN, could lose out on a $1.2m contract bonus should he miss four more games this season. On Sunday, the Heat announced a 10-game suspension without pay for Waiters for conduct detrimental to the team stemming from the incident. “We are very disappointed in Dion’s actions this season that include the very scary situation on Thursday night, and grateful that the outcome wasn’t worse,” the team said in a statement. The suspension is Waiters’ second of the season. He was also barred from Miami’s season opener after expressing frustration on social media regarding his role on the team.
