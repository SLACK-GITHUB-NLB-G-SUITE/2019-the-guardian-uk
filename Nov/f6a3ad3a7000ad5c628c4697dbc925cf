Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’ve seen electric toothbrushes in Boots and there’s a huge price difference. There are Philips ones for £299, Oral-Bs for £140, but other Oral-Bs for £35, and a Colgate for £18. I need to know what’s the difference between all the models particularly as they all look much the same? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
