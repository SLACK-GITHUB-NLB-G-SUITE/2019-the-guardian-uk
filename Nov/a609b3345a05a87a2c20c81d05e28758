Thank you, Katherine Rundell, for a great article paying tribute to the indomitable Lyra Silvertongue (Review, 2 November). To add to the antecedents cited, I suggest Lyra owes something to Cathy Earnshaw, whose creator, Emily Brontë, was memorably characterised by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar as “Milton’s rebellious daughter”. It was Cathy for whom “heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.” Substitute Oxford for the moors and I imagine Lyra would concur.

Perhaps something to consider when deciding whether to vote Labour at the forthcoming general election.Barbara HawkinsGreat Ayton, North Yorkshire • The print version of your article (Six ways to save money – and fight the climate crisis, 2 November) did not feature the easiest, cheapest and most effective way of reducing electricity consumption. Just change any remaining tungsten, halogen or compact fluorescent bulbs for LEDs.John FreemanKingswinford, West Midlands • Your list of 10 best Jane Fonda films (G2, 1 November) missed out Cat Ballou!

For me, it runs very close to Klute as being her best.Mark JacobsRedditch, Worcestershire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
