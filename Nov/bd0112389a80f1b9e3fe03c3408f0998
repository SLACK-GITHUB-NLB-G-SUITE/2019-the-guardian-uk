We have just been sent a letter by Direct Line telling us that it is not prepared to renew our home insurance as our property no longer meets its “risk requirements”. We have had no claims on the household insurance, hold two car policies with Direct Line, have no financial problems and live at the top of a steep hill. Concerned that my ID has been compromised, I checked my credit rating but it is excellent. Direct Line refuses to tell us the reason for the decision, so we cannot be totally frank with another insurer when we try to find cover elsewhere. PH, Aberdeen Direct Line would not tell me the reason, either – all it would say is that your home no longer fits its underwriting criteria. However, a bit more delving revealed that a neighbour had had their home broken into, and their cars stolen using the keys taken from the house. I suspect this is the reason you have been dumped. Because you also insure your cars with Direct Line, the firm would have faced a double payout if you suffered the same fate. On a positive note, Direct Line says that you do not have to tell a new insurer you have been refused cover, which would have made getting affordable cover very difficult. House break-ins for car keys have become a big problem. It emerged last week that thieves are using blowtorches on front door locks to enable them to get in. There’s been a spate of this in Bradford and, more recently, Stockport. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
