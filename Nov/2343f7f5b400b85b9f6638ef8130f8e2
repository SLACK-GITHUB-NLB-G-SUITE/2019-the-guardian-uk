Somerset have been handed a 12-point deduction for next season’s County Championship after being found guilty of breaching pitch regulations. A Cricket Discipline Committee Disciplinary Panel ruled against the county over the poor state of the pitch for their match against Essex at Taunton in September. The rain-affected Division One match ended in a draw that handed Essex the championship title. Somerset’s full punishment is a 24-point deduction, of which 12 are suspended for two years. They have 14 days to appeal against the decision. Following an investigation Somerset were charged with a breach of the regulation which requires that: “Each county shall actively seek to prepare the best quality cricket pitch that it can for the match that it is staging.” Somerset accepted a pitch rating of “poor” was correct but pleaded not guilty to a second element of the charge that the Taunton surface “was not the best quality pitch that Somerset was able to prepare for the match”. A statement on the club’s website said: “Somerset await the full report from the cricket discipline commission before considering our next course of action.”
