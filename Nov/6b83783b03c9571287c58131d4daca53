A new survey has revealed that nearly half of women diagnosed with breast cancer have experienced sexual difficulties as a result of treatment. According to the study, 46% of women have experienced sexual problems including loss of libido, vaginal dryness, and pain. More than half said they were too embarrassed to get medical help, while 45% were concerned about wasting the doctor’s time. The research was carried out by Breast Cancer Now and YouGov, who questioned more than 1,000 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the last 10 years. We would love to hear from women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and are experiencing sexual issues due to treatment. We are interested in hearing in detail from women who have or have had breast cancer and are suffering from sexual problems. How has the treatment affected your sex life? What sexual problems have you been experiencing? How long have you been suffering from these problems? Did you seek help from your GP? If not, why didn’t you? How has this affected your relationship with your partner? How has this affected your mental health? Have the issues resolved themselves or gotten better over time?
