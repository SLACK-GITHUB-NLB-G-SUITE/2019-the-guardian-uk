It was a delight to encounter Julia Cave in the corridors and canteen of the BBCâ€™s Kensington House in the 1960s and 70s when she was a producer on Chronicle, full of ideas and enthusiasm for her latest project. It was pleasurable too, 50 years later, to see her at London galleries, continuing to enjoy art. The idea for The Great War, for which Julia so memorably researched contributors, may have come from Alasdair Milne, head of the department from which it emanated. But its producers were Tony Essex and Gordon Watkins.
