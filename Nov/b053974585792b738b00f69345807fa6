Whisper it, but it seems we really do have a three-way title race. Everything went to form over the weekend, with the top three beating the bottom three, and all of them look like lasting the course as we near the halfway point of the season. Arsenal’s stunning form last term, and early this, meant I’d expected them to run away with it but the other contenders look convincing. Manchester City cut loose late on to score five at Bristol City while Chelsea got the job done more quickly in hitting Birmingham for six. Neither of those results were ever in much doubt and it was only the champions who had a slightly tough time. Were Arsenal a little complacent against Liverpool, who remain at the foot of the table? It is the only reason I can think of that they only won 1-0, and they may yet pay for not being more clinical. If there are three teams challenging then the title will come down to small margins and the hit Arsenal took in goal difference terms on Sunday – there’s is now six worse than Chelsea’s and five shy of City’s – may yet become something that makes them kick themselves. When your CB goes on an adventure 👀@Mdawg1bright 👏 pic.twitter.com/jXZiG8uMTZ Liverpool are tough, dogged and relatively hard to beat for a side that has only picked up a point from seven games. In fact they have the best defensive record of the bottom seven teams but the problem for Vicky Jepson is that, on current evidence, that is going to be very cold comfort. At some point they will desperately need to start attacking in order to get enough points to survive and it’s something they will surely have to look at in terms of bringing in reinforcements. They were actually unlucky not to take the lead at Arsenal on Sunday but went into their shell after that and are yet to score a goal from open play. Jess Clarke, an experienced international who should bring dynamism and creativity out wide having come back from a long-term injury, will help their cause but they are going to need more – otherwise the rest of this season will continue to be a grim struggle. Everton remain on the fringes of the leading pack after a good 3-1 win over Spurs, and I must say I’m delighted for my old team. Willie Kirk came in this time last year and, after bringing in the players he wanted – with the shining example of Chloe Kelly – over pre-season he has really turned the squad around. They could have won by several more on Sunday and it is testament to the way they play. They show some moments of world-class quality and it has been a joy to watch. Over the last decade Everton had been going backwards, but they are on the front foot now and it is great to see such a young, energetic team. Defeating Spurs in the way they did was no small feat: the north London side have been really refreshing themselves this season, exceeding expectations on the biggest stage, and have refused to stand still. They’ve harnessed the momentum of their promotion campaign and will bounce back from this result. What. A. Hit! 🚀@JustLuc_ with an absolute beauty that sealed @EvertonWomen's victory over Spurs pic.twitter.com/jfvIaAzNpU Last week I criticised Reading for being flaky and, well, I’m glad they read this column! They came back from two goals and a player down to win at West Ham, which was a fantastic result in the circumstances, but it does underline that they are a see-saw team. It is almost as if they have to go behind before their resilience and team spirit set in, which is a shame because they have the characteristics of a top side and have not seen too much squad upheaval in the last four seasons. The worry is that they always find themselves chasing games, and that is not how you become a top team. I have the impression there will be some big changes there in the summer; a lot of players have been there a long time and I don’t think everything is going brilliantly. Maybe it needs freshening up but, for now, they will hope a comeback like the one on Sunday is a turning point. What a performance it was from Manchester United and Leah Galton, who scored twice and set up another in their 4-0 victory against Brighton. Galton, as I have mentioned before, looks outstanding at the moment and I know Phil Neville has taken a good look at her. England do not really have a left-sided attacking player, so the current setup could be begging for someone like her. United are on form, having had a hard schedule at the start of the season. They are finding it easier to show their attacking side now and Lauren James – who is still just 18 – is benefiting from that. They beat Brighton at a canter and Casey Stoney will be pleased they are showing all sides of their game now: they rarely have an off-day defensively, which is quite something for a team in its infancy, and when everything comes together as it did on Sunday they look like some force. 👊 @ManUtdWomen were on top form 👊@leah_galton21 smashed it home during their win over Brighton, as she also bagged a brace pic.twitter.com/xswSKIAX3K
