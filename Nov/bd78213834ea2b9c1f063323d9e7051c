Joelinton, Miguel Almirón and Allan Saint-Maximin cost a collective £77m but have scored only one goal between them. Nevertheless Steve Bruce will keep faith with the front three as Newcastle look to reprise last season’s win at St James’ Park. “I would love them to score a goal but the threat they’ve caused at the top end of the pitch and what they contribute towards the team is the thing I look at,” Bruce said. “At times they’ve been terrific and, when they do start scoring, we’ll be fine.” City face a testing run as they aim to keep in touch with Liverpool and cannot afford to drop points.
