Radiohead: an enigma wrapped inside a conundrum concealed within a mystery, hiding behind a bloke dancing like a deranged cockerel in heat. Who are Radiohead, and why? For decades the personalities at play within the band have remained unfathomable. But with recent years featuring a run of solo projects from Jonny Greenwood (2019’s Volume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water); Ed O’Brien (2019’s single Santa Teresa); Phil Selway (2014’s Weatherhouse); and Colin Greenwood (nothing, actually), we’re beginning to colour in those formless blanks loitering behind Thom Yorke.
