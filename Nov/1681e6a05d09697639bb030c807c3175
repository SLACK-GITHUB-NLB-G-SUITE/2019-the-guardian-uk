De La Rue warned on Tuesday there was “significant doubt” that it could continue as a going concern, knocking about £40m off its market value. It scrapped its dividend to tackle mounting debts and its shares fell 20% to 142p. The banknote printer’s warning follows a series of setbacks including two profit warnings, an investigation into suspected corruption in South Sudan and the loss of a £400m contract for Britain’s new passports. “We have concluded there is a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern,” De La Rue said in a statement, adding that it was focused on delivering a turnaround plan. It would conduct a review of its business to speed up its restructuring plan by reducing overhead costs and focusing on inventory management. Last month it appointed Clive Vacher as its chief executive. The company said its directors had considered a number of factors in reaching the conclusion about continuing as a going concern, including its trading results in the first six months and its impact on future performance as well as its access to credit. De La Rue, which produces passports for 40 countries, said its net debt had risen by more than 58% to £170.7m as its banknote printing operation struggled with depressed margins amid stiff competition and the growing popularity of digital payments. The company posted a half-yearly operating loss of £9.2m, compared with a profit of £10.1m a year earlier, chiefly due to restructuring charges. Although its adjusted operating profit plunged 87% to £2.2m for the six months ending 29 September, the company forecast it would fare better in the second half as it expects more favourable currency volumes and benefits from cost cuts. De La Rue expects annual adjusted profit between £20m and £25m.
