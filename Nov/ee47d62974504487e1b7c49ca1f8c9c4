The Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, has resigned from Boris Johnson’s cabinet over a row about whether he knew of allegations that a former aide sabotaged a rape trial. Cairns had been under huge pressure in recent days over the actions of Ross England, his former adviser, with the furore threatening to derail the Tory campaign in Wales. The minister sent a letter to Johnson saying he was confident he would be cleared by any investigation into his behaviour, but he was stepping down because it was such a “sensitive matter”. Johnson thanked Cairns for his role in abolishing toll charges on the Severn Bridge and his “unstinting record of service for the party in Wales”. Wales is full of key target leave-voting seats that Johnson needs to win to secure a majority. Last week, the Welsh Conservatives claimed Cairns was unaware of his former aide’s role in the rape trial before it became public a few days earlier. On Tuesday, BBC Wales published an email it said was sent to Cairns by his special adviser, Geraint Davies, more than a year earlier, in which Davies wrote: “I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court.” The email was sent on 2 August 2018, the BBC reported. Four months later, England was selected as the Welsh Conservative candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election. He was later suspended after being accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging the rape trial. The rape victim is among those who called for Cairns to resign. On Wednesday, Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister and Labour leader in Wales, said Cairns’ position was another example of the Conservative party’s arrogance. He said it stood beside remarks by Jacob Rees-Mogg about the Grenfell fire and comments from a Tory candidate in Gower, south Wales, suggesting people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed “putting down”. Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, said Cairns had been caught “brazenly lying”.
