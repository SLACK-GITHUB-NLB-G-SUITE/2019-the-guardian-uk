Where do you spend Sundays? At least half in our family home in East Sussex. I like the peace and quiet. Is it a slow start? I find it hard to sleep in – I want to be up early and enjoy full days now. I’m a boxing fanatic and record the US fights overnight and watch them while everyone is still asleep. Then we all pile into the kitchen for breakfast. We take it in turns to cook. Our kitchen is like a café that never seems to close. The best spot for a Sunday bite? Light on the Common in Wimbledon does a great English breakfast. If I’m in the city that’s where I’ll be. Do you visit your own restaurants? Now and again I pop in with my son for a spot check to see how service is going, or for a quick bite to eat. Usually I stay away, though. For years I was in the kitchen every weekend. Do you always go out? No thanks. I’d rather be at home. I spend my life around people and talking: to customers, to our team. So on Sunday that’s the last thing I want to do. No social media, no work, no emails. What’s your soundtrack to Sunday? Talkradio. I find listening to what people think can be educational – it’s not uncommon for a caller to change my mind. It’s a way I can engage in the conversation without having to talk. Worst Sunday habit? Popping into the garden and not returning for 12 hours. My wife, somewhat pissed off, has to find me in the dark, usually doing something stupid like chopping down a tree. The perfect night in? I’ve only just discovered box sets. For a long time I’d only watch shows live on television, to be part of something, but that’s all changing now. What’s better than a good murder mystery and a bottle of white Burgundy?
