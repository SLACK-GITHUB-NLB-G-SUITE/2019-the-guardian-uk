Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson will miss England’s final Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday because of injury and illness, respectively. It is understood Gomez clashed knees in an accidental collision with Kieran Trippier. Henderson missed the 7-0 home win over Montenegro through suspension and arrived in the England camp with a viral infection. Gomez sustained a knock in training on Friday and did not recover sufficiently enough to travel. The pair returned to Liverpool, meaning England headed to Pristina with a 23-man squad. England sealed their qualification for next summer’s tournament against Montenegro on Thursday. However, England’s 1,000th international was somewhat marred by the boos that greeted Gomez when he came on as a second-half substitute. Gomez was left with a scratch on his face following a confrontation with Raheem Sterling at St George’s Park. Sterling was then dropped from the squad to face Montenegro.
