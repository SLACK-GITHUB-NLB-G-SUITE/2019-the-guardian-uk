Jimmy Garoppolo threw two long touchdown passes and the San Francisco harassed Aaron Rodgers all night, leading the 49ers to a 37-8 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. Garoppolo connected on a 42-yard touchdown strike to Deebo Samuel in the second quarter and a 61-yarder to George Kittle in the third to get San Francisco (10-1) off to a resounding start to a grueling three-game stretch. Following the game against the Packers (8-3), the Niners will travel to Baltimore (8-2) and New Orleans (9-2) the next two weeks in a stretch that will go a long way to determining whether San Francisco will be able to hold off Seattle (9-2) in a tight NFC West race. Rodgers lost a fumble on the opening drive one of the five sacks he took and failed to convert a single third down on 13 tries before getting pulled late in the fourth quarter. He finished 20 for 33 for 104 yards. A thing of BEAUTY. @JimmyG_10 to @gkittle46 for the 61-yard TD ðŸ™Œ#GoNiners pic.twitter.com/Ldv9SocBpa After allowing 78 points the past three weeks in two games against Arizonaâ€™s Kyler Murray and one against Seattleâ€™s Russell Wilson, the Ninersâ€™ defense was back to its dominant form. San Francisco allowed 198 yards on 70 plays, didnâ€™t allow a single completion longer than 15 yards and got a key stop against Aaron Jones on a fourth-and-one run in the first half when the outcome was still in doubt. Garoppolo then put the game away with the two long touchdowns, part of a day when he went 14 for 20 for 253 yards and most importantly committed no turnovers. He was helped by the return of Kittle, who had six catches for 129 yards in his first game back after missing the past two contests with injuries to his knee and ankle.
