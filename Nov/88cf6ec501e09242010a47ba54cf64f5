This weekend, during a launch for his book Triggered: How The Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, Donald Trump Jr was, well, triggered. His thesis is that leftwingers can’t handle differences in opinion. Because of that, he argues they routinely engage in a number of silencing techniques – such as no-platforming – to discourage dissenting voices. But it was his own supporters who pushed back against him on Sunday, when they shouted at him for refusing to engage in a Q&A during an event in Los Angeles to support his book launch. Trump Jr reportedly tried to argue that he didn’t want to take questions because the left might distort his words online, which sounds a lot like not being up for open discourse. When the crowd become loud enough to drown him out, he stormed off stage. How’s that for being thin-skinned? As it turns out, Don Jr is actually incredibly easily triggered himself. Let us count the ways: Trump Jr believes the platform is engaged in conspiratorial practices against him (namely, preventing Instagram users from seeing his account when they search for him). Just like a guy who blames the “algorithm” when he doesn’t get enough matches on Tinder, Trump Jr accused Instagram of “shadow-banning” him. “I work hard on my content and try to give my followers a view into my life and would love it if you didn’t make it hard for them to see my posts and for me to gain new followers,” he said in a September post … to his Instagram. Where no one will ever see it. Unfortunately for me, I can still see all of Trump Jr’s content when I search for him. In September 2018, Vanity Fair wrote about Trump’s increasing paranoia since becoming president, including a claim that Trump Jr worried his dad was losing sleep over impeachment. But he was not going to get a publication like Vanity Fair get away with comments like that. “With 4.8m ‘followers’ how do you average less than 20 RTs for your last 20 or so posts?” he quipped. That’ll show ’em. What a joke, you think I worry my father isn’t sleeping?🤣🤣🤣 I have never and will never worry about that. Keep making crap up. Oh, VF with 4.8m “followers” how do you average less than 20 RTs for your last 20 or so posts? BUYING FOLLOWERS MUCH? SAD, PATHETIC, & IRRELEVANT! https://t.co/hAhNAl88KL In 2016, a reporter got hold of photos showing the Trump brothers posing with hunting trophies including a leopard, a crocodile hung by a noose and a severed elephant’s tail from a hunting trip in 2011. The animal rights organisation Peta responded with a limited-edition Halloween costume: of Trump Jr being mauled by a leopard. Trump responded in a tweet: “Ironically, there are few orgs in the world that have as much animal blood on their hands as PETA,” he tweeted, referring to the fact that the group euthanizes some of the dying animals that come into its shelters. Er, how about the estimated 1.7 million hunting trophies that may have been traded between nations between 2004 and 2014? Ironically, there are few orgs in world history that have as much animal blood on their hands as PETA. You hypocrites are literally an animal slaughter factory."In the last 11 years, PETA has killed 29,426 dogs, cats, rabbits, & other domestic animals." https://t.co/fqXJQ9ACFQ https://t.co/FWatgzpcAi When the Texas congressman Joaquín Castro sent out a viral tweet naming Trump Sr’s donors in San Antonio, Trump Jr was not going to be silenced. Appearing on Fox and Friends, Trump Jr compared the list to the rape and kill lists put out by the Dayton, Ohio, shooter before he killed nine people and left 27 injured. Holy shit. On Fox & Friends, Donald Trump Jr compares the list Joaquin Castro released of public info about who has donated to Trump with a mass shooter's kill list."That list sort of screams like the Dayton, Ohio, shooter's list, right? ... it's pretty scary." pic.twitter.com/gZ1PYO94EI In an interview with Breitbart News, the man who is living off his dad’s name reportedly said that being the son of a billionaire meant that no one wanted to hear his opinion. “Now, listen, in this country I’m the son of a billionaire, I can’t even have an opinion any more … I could be Albert Einstein and they would discredit me as a horrible scientist,” he said. If you have never heard of this elusive Twitter user, it’s because he’s a nobody – according to Trump Jr. Yet when Jerry131212 tweeted Don Jr to let him know that “Your dad’s knowledge of politics is abysmal at best” (the tweet is now deleted), Trump Jr really needed to show him who was boss – you know, because of how up for open discourse he is and all that. @Jerry131212 well I guess we lost your vote and that of your 0 followers. If u want to criticize don't hide behind a ghost account pussy! It is funny that a book that attempts to take aim at oversensitive lefties seems like it was written by a writer who is pretty darn bruised. Guardian writers described it as a “litany of trolling and insults worthy of his father”. Triggered much?
