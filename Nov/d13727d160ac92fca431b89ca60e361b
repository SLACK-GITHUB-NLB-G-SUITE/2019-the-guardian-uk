The letter from 16 paediatric professionals (Vaping poses serious threat to children, 27 November) is an argument based on error and supposition, starting with the claim that “nobody knows exactly what substances are in these liquids”. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency knows exactly what’s in them, and UK products are highly regulated. Surveillance by Action on Smoking and Health and Cancer Research UK points to vaping displacing smoking among young people, and that there is only negligible use among never-smokers. The letter writers might like to consider the positive effect of parents who smoked switching to vaping, avoiding smoking-related disability and premature death. That surely improves young people’s wellbeing.Louise RossNational Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
