How my mother would have loved to be called a beatnik (Learning to cook like a beatnik, G2, 28 November). Growing up in the north in the late 40s and 50s our weekly menu was an “unmovable feast”. Sunday roast provided gravy for meatless panackelty Monday or minced leftover meat for a pie. The week progressed through mince and tatties, mince on toast, shepherd’s pie, and once in a blue moon a mutton chop. Friday was putting the knife into my brother’s money box for pennies for a tin of beans until my father’s pay came. Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • To “make [Boris] Johnson the shortest-serving PM ever” may well be an inspiring idea (Editorial, 27 November), but that objective has already been missed, as he surpassed George Canning’s length of tenure last week. He might just, however, manage to get into second place, as he will not pass Lord Goderich (as it happens, Canning’s successor in office) until the weekend after the general election. That is up to the electorate to help him achieve.Stephen HartColwall, Herefordshire • Prof Alan McKinnon (Letters, 25 November) said that only 14% of adults claimed some knowledge of the role of logistics in the economy. The place is full of trains, lorries, buses, vans and boys on bikes emblazoned with “logistics”. Nobody knows what it means. I used to know but I’ve forgotten.Francis McCahillFraserburgh, Aberdeenshire • If a painter paints, a builder builds and so on, shouldn’t someone who attends something be an “attender” (Letters, 29 November)?Richard WalkerWest Malvern, Worcestershire • Has anyone else noticed that “Get Brexit Done” is an anagram of “Re-extend, bigot”?David LawrenceNorwich • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
