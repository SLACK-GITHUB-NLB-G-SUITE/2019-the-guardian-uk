The UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, has warned UK Athletics it risks having a cut in its £27m funding if it fails to address the problems that has seen its chief executive, chair and performance director depart over 10 turbulent months. Munday insisted, however, she would not make any “kneejerk” reactions to the ongoing turmoil – and promised that British athletes would not be affected at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics despite the crisis in their governing body. “We do an annual review with every sport, looking at its performance and governance and how it is managed – and clearly the outcome of those reviews influences our discussions about how we invest,” Munday said when asked about the UKA’s problems. “We have a responsibility to make sure we invest in sports that have the right standards, systems and culture. But I also know we want to enable sports to give the athletes the best chance of getting medals.” Munday also confirmed she would be meeting the UKA chair, Chris Clark, in the coming days to discuss the fallout from the departure on Monday of Zara Hyde Peters as UKA chief executive and how best to revive the sport. “They are clearly having some difficulties and we are in conversation with them about how we can support them to ensure that athletics, from a leadership and governance point of view, gets back on the right track,” Munday said. “It would be very easy in this situation to make a kneejerk reaction. Things unfolded pretty quickly over the weekend and I think it’s appropriate to take a deep breath, step back, and have a conversation about what’s the best thing to do now to get things right for the long term. “I’m sure the athletes will probably be distressed looking at what’s going on with their sport. But I also think they and their coaches will have their heads down focusing on what they need to be doing for Tokyo. We want to make sure that stuff that has gone on never has the opportunity to be a distraction.”
