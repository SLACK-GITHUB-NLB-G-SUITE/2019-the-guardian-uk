Cosy bars and cafes, frosty landscapes, festivals of light, food or music … A cold-weather break means different – and often more memorable – pleasures from those enjoyed in kinder temperatures. This week we’d love to hear about where in the UK or Europe you like to head in winter, whether it’s a great hotel, a buzzing town or city, or an activity hub for sportier types. Tell us about where you stayed and what you did, including prices and websites if applicable. We’re not talking skiing trips here – but other winter sports like skating or snowshoeing would be great. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. The winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher from UK.hotels.com.
