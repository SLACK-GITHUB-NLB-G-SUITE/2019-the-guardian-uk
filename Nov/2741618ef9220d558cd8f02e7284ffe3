Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Every website I go on has one of those infuriating GDPR messages about cookies that I have to accept or decline. I’ve got to the point where I just blindly click “accept” to be done with it. Am I making a big mistake? If I press “decline” will it make any difference? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
