Robert Armstrong, the Guardian’s former rugby union correspondent, has died at the age of 76. Armstrong, who also covered football and tennis for many years, first joined the paper in 1970 as a sub-editor and worked on the arts pages in Manchester before transferring to London six years later. A proud son of Ulster, he wrote primarily about football before succeeding the late David Frost as the paper’s rugby correspondent in 1987-88. As well as the 1991 World Cup he reported on the 1993 and 1997 British and Irish Lions tours to New Zealand and South Africa before relinquishing the role in 1999. On far-flung overseas assignments for the paper it was not unknown for Armstrong to dictate his copy to his wife, Merete Bates, a former Guardian art critic, who would then phone it in to the sports desk. In his later years at home on the Dorset coast he retained a keen interest in sport and politics, even after the recent diagnosis of a brain tumour. He died in hospital in Dorchester on Monday with his wife at his bedside.
