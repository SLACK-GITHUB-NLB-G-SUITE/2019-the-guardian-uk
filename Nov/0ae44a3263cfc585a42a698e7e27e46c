Teemu Pukki scored twice as Finland beat Liechtenstein 3-0 in Helsinki to book a place at Euro 2020 and reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time in the countryâ€™s history. Jasse Tuominen put the Finns ahead after 21 minutes before Pukki converted a penalty early in the second half and wrapped up the points with their third goal 15 minutes from time. The win secured second spot in Group J for Finland with 18 points, six behind the group winners, Italy. Finland, a nation of around 5.5 million people, was the only major Nordic country to have failed to reach a World Cup or European Championship. Breaking that duck at the 5G-aerena led to home fans pouring on to the field at the final whistle and giving each other high-fives and congratulating the players as fireworks exploded around them. Norway kept alive their slim hopes of automatic qualification for the Euros with an easy 4-0 win over the Faroe Islands in a Group F qualifier. Tore Reginiussen and Iver Fossum both scored in the opening eight minutes to give the hosts a commanding lead before Alexander Soerloth added another two goals midway through the second half to secure the win. The win puts Norway in fourth place on 14 points, six behind the leaders Spain. Sweden are second on 15 points and Romania third on 14 points thanks to their two away goals in Oslo.
