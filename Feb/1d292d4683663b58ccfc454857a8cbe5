Ozzy Osbourne has been hospitalised as his bout of flu worsens. His wife Sharon Osbourne tweeted: “As some of you may have heard, Ozzy was admitted to hospital following some complications from the flu. His doctors feel this is the best way to get him on a quicker road to recovery. Thanks to everyone for their concern and love.” Osbourne recently postponed a European tour due to the illness, and is aiming to reschedule it for September. This is his second stay in hospital in recent months, having undergone treatment for an infection in his hand in October 2018. “It just seems that since October, everything I touch has turned to shit,” he said in a statement. “First, the staph infection in my thumb and now coming down with the flu and bronchitis. I want to apologise to all of my fans who have been so loyal over the years, my band, my crew and to [support act] Judas Priest for letting you all down.” The No More Tours 2 is due to be his last tour, but Osbourne has said “I can’t say I won’t do some shows here and there.”
