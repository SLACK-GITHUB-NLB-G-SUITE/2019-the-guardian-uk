No mobile phones. No private laptops. No checking personal emails or social media. And at the end of the day, all access cards must be locked in a safe. More than €1bn (£870m) and 12 years after construction began, Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) has officially opened its new Berlin home, the world’s biggest intelligence headquarters. The building, close to the route of the former Berlin Wall, is one of Germany’s most secretive spaces, with strict security rules governing what employees there can and cannot do. Angela Merkel visited the headquarters on Friday and spoke of the BND’s history and the important role it plays. “In an often very confusing world,” the chancellor said, “now, more urgently than ever, Germany needs a strong and efficient foreign intelligence service.” The site previously housed police barracks, destroyed during the second world war. It then became the site of a sports stadium, demolished as part of Germany’s bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Approximately 3,200 of an expected 4,000 employees have already arrived and are working at the new building, with others yet to move up from the old headquarters outside Munich. The agency employs about 6,500 people in Germany and around the world. The building was made using 135,000 cubic metres of concrete and 20,000 tons of steel, and has 14,000 windows and 12,000 doors, the agency says on its website. The opening ceremony on Friday was a long time coming: the building was originally scheduled to be finished in 2011 but this was delayed by construction issues, and for other reasons. In 2015 thieves stole taps from toilets across the building, resulting in flooding and damage, in an incident nicknamed “Watergate” in the German press.
