Wasps flanker Thomas Young will make his Wales Six Nations debut against Italy on Saturday as one of 10 changes to the side that won in Paris, the Welsh Rugby Union has announced. The team will be captained by Jonathan Davies, who will lead his country for the first time, with Alun Wyn Jones named among the replacements. The changes also see a recall at fly-half for Dan Biggar with Gareth Anscombe dropping to the bench; Aled Davies partners Biggar at half-back. Among those who started the win over France, only Davies, Liam Williams, Josh Adams, Josh Navidi and Adam Beard are in the XV to play Italy in Rome. “We have made a number of changes this weekend but have picked what we think is a very exciting team that still has huge experience throughout it,” said Wales head coach, Warren Gatland. “We have had a squad of 31 training together, replicating the Rugby World Cup and it is important they get game-time.
