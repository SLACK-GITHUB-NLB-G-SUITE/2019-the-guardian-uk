The Guardian and the Observer have received 33 nominations at the National Press Awards, including multiple coverage of the Windrush and Cambridge Analytica scandals. The Guardian has been shortlisted for news website of the year, while both outlets are nominated for daily and Sunday newspaper of the year respectively. The Guardian’s coverage of the Windrush scandal – which exposed the wrongful deportation of long-term UK residents and eventually led to the resignation of the home secretary Amber Rudd – is recognised in several categories. The reporter behind the stories, Amelia Gentleman, is nominated for news reporter of the year and the Windrush story is also shortlisted in the investigation and campaign categories. Carole Cadwalladr is shortlisted for technology journalist of the year for her work for the Observer on the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which left Facebook dealing with a global political crisis. The story has also been nominated for scoop of the year and investigation of the year. Other nominees include Marina Hyde for political commentator of the year, Robert Booth and Frances Ryan for specialist journalist of the year, and Simon Hattenstone, Miranda Sawyer and Sophie Heawood, all for interviewer of the year. Hannah Jane Parkinson is nominated for health journalist of the year while Daniel Taylor is nominated for sports journalist of the year. Martin Chulov is nominated for foreign reporter of the year and Jess Cartner-Morley is on the shortlist for fashion journalist of the year. Guardian Weekend is shortlisted for magazine of the year and the Observer’s New Review is among the list of nominees for supplement of the year. The Guardian’s Bias in Britain project, which looked at the hidden impact of everyday racism, is shortlisted for the first Reporting Diversity award. This new category was introduced in response to criticism that the awards failed to represent the diversity of the British media. Despite this, there are just a handful of non-white journalists among the 156 individuals shortlisted on Tuesday. The awards, hosted by the Society of Editors, will be held on 2 April in London. The shortlist for the final category, the Georgina Henry Prize for Innovation, which is given in memory of the former deputy editor of the Guardian, will be announced at a later date. Ian Murray, the chairman of the judges and executive director of the Society of Editors, said: “Once again the British press has proven that it is simply the best in the world by the sheer breadth and depth of the entries for these awards. The awards night itself… is rightly considered the time when the press shows off its talent to the world.” The full list of nominees across the Guardian and the Observer: Business and finance journalist of the yearRob DaviesSimon Goodley Political commentator of the yearMarina Hyde Foreign reporter of the yearMartin Chulov Science journalist of the yearHannah DevlinRobin McKie Health journalist of the yearHannah Jane Parkinson Fashion journalist of the yearJess Cartner-Morley Technology journalist of the yearCarole Cadwalladr Environment journalist of the yearMatthew TaylorRobin McKie Specialist journalist of the yearFrances RyanRobert Booth Reporting diversity awardThe Guardian’s Bias in Britain series Sports journalist of the yearDaniel Taylor Interviewer of the year – broadsheetMiranda SawyerSimon HattenstoneSophie Heawood Critic of the yearGrace DentMiranda Sawyer Cartoonist of the yearChris Riddell Scoop of the yearCambridge Analytica Files Investigation of the yearWindrush scandalCambridge Analytica files News reporter of the yearAmelia Gentleman Supplement of the yearThe New Review, The Observer Magazine of the yearGuardian Weekend Front page of the yearThe Guardian, Lives of Grenfell TowerThe Observer, Revealed: 50m Facebook files taken Campaign of the yearWindrush scandal News website of the yearThe Guardian Daily newspaper of the yearThe Guardian Sunday newspaper of the yearThe Observer
