In the middle of the Venn diagram between my head, heart and stomach are these beans. I long for them, I love them and I cooked them several times over Christmas and new year after talking to my British-Iraqi friend Assallah’s mother, Amina, about them. They’re essentially cannellini beans in a spiced tomato sauce topped with a sprightly, lemony coriander oil. But they are also more than that: they are a taste of home. Amina uses a pre-bought Iraqi seven-spice mix called baharat in her recipe, which you could use instead of the spices in mine. Prep 10 minCook 30 minServes 4 Rapeseed oil, for frying2 brown onions, peeled and finely choppedSalt½ tsp ground black pepper ½ tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground allspice½ tsp ground cumin50g fresh coriander, picked, stalks finely chopped1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes2 x 400g tins cannellini beans, drained and rinsed1 lemon, zested, and juiced, to give about 3 tbsp lemon juice Heat three tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan on a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, a teaspoon of salt, the black pepper, cinnamon, allspice, cumin and coriander stalks, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until soft and dark. Keep an eye on it, because you don’t want the onions or spices to catch. When the mix is soft and sweet-smelling, add the tomatoes, beans and 200ml water, bring up to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. In a bowl, mix two tablespoons of rapeseed oil, the coriander leaves, lemon zest and juice, and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. To serve, divide the stew between four bowls and top with a generous spoonful of the coriander and lemon oil.
