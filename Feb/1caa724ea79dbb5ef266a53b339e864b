The Washington Wizards’ John Wall, one of the most talented players in the NBA, will miss at least a year after a fall at his home. The five-time All-Star ruptured his left achilles tendon during the fall. Wall was already due to miss the rest of this season after heel surgery. He will now have an operation on his achilles and is not expected to return to action until at least a year after the surgery. “Wall had developed an infection in the incision from initial [heel] surgery on 8 January, and he suffered the rupture after slipping and falling in his home,” read a statement on the Wizards’ website. “The rupture was diagnosed by [Wizards doctor] Dr Wiemi Douoguih during a procedure to clean out the infection.” The news is particularly worrying for a player who has struggled with injuries. He missed two months after knee surgery last season, and had double knee surgery in 2016. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract extension in July 2017 and is due to make $37.8m next season. The Wizards are three games outside the playoffs in the Eastern Conference but team owner Ted Leonsis says he expects the team to push for the postseason, despite Wall’s absence. “You have to go to the players, the coach, the staff and say, ‘Do we have enough to make the playoffs?’ And to a person, I was told, ‘Yes we do.’” Leonsis told Washington radio station WTOP last week.
