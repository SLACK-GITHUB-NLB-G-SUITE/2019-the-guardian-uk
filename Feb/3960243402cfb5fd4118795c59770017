Ten people have been killed and at least three injured in a fire at the training centre for the Rio de Janeiro football club Flamengo early on Friday morning. Firefighters were called to the blaze at the Ninho de Urubu training ground just after 5am, a fire official told the Associated Press. It was not known if any players were hurt in the blaze, although the club has accommodation for teenage players at the ground. The ages and identities of those killed were not released, but the three injured were 14, 15 and 16 years old, the official said. The injured were taken to local hospitals, but their condition was not immediately known. Aerial footage showed twisted corrugated iron roofs and piles of charred items. Nearby trees were also scorched. The fire followed days of heavy rain that killed at least six people in the city. An AP reporter outside the complex saw two ambulances and a fire truck enter. The facility was closed, and no officials emerged address media. Family members, friends and neighbours were gathering outside in hopes of getting information. Jefferson Rodrigues, who runs a small inn near the club, said he had reached a 15-year-old player he had befriended. “I am very happy. I just spoke to Caix Suarez and he is alive,” he said. “He lost his phone and all of his things, but the important thing is he is alive.” Joao Pedro da Cruz, a 16-year-old player in the Flamengo youth league, told G1 news portal that he decided not to stay the night at thHe went to a friend’s house instead. “The majority of stayed, my friends stayed” he said. “Today I woke up and heard this terrible news.” As news of the fire broke, several other players and teams expressed their condolences on Twitter. Vinicius Junior, the teenage Real Madrid forward who trained at the facility before joining for the Spanish club last year, tweeted: “What sad news! Praying for everyone! Strength, strength and strength. Que notícia triste! Oremos por todos! Força, força e força 😢 “We are extremely sad and shaken by the news of the fire,” tweeted Chapeco, a team in southern Brazil that lost 22 players in a plane crash in 2016. Flamengo made no official statement other than to tweet that it was in mourning, but rival teams across Brazil, including fellow Rio sides Botafogo, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama, expressed their solidarity. The tragedy came a day before the side were due to play their arch rivals Fluminense at the Maracana stadium. The derby match is now expected to be postponed. Flamengo, the alma mater of players such as Zico, Junior and Leonardo, is one of the best-supported clubs in Brazil and is famous around the world. Known by fans as the Red-and-Black, they won the Copa Libertadores, South America’s version of the Champions League, in 1981 and lifted the Intercontinental Cup a few months later. Zico, who is outside Brazil, wrote on Instagram: “What a shock getting this news here on the other side of the world. May the Red-and-Black nation have strength and faith to get through this moment.” One of Flamengo’s most high-profile fans, the country’s vice-president, General Hamilton Mourao, also expressed his condolences. “As a fan and sportsman I stand in solidarity with the families, the club and the Red-and-Black nation,” he tweeted. “May God comfort all.” Like many professional clubs in Brazil, Flamengo has a youth development programme for promising young players in their early teens. Many, particularly those who live outside Rio, stay at the facilities while training. After years of financial difficulties, Flamengo expanded its facilities last year. In addition to accommodation for young players, they include several pitches, an aquatic park, a gym, a medical centre and a mini-stadium.
