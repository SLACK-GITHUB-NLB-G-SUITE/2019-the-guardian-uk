Preparation, preparation, preparation. February is the month of maintenance. The time for digging in organic matter. Try to pick a dry day, not too cold – you are not looking to move frozen soil up to the surface. Sort your garden borders. Get ready. The days are getting longer, from an hour and a half to around two hours by the end of the month depending on how far north you are. Note that this doesn’t mean warmer. February is a harsh month, a time of frost, with a mean temperature in the UK of around 1 C. So dig and clear, enjoy the good work, get your sowing beds ready because seeds will start going in soon. There are potatoes, of course. It’s time for chitting your first earlies, the fastest growing spuds, for planting later in February. I stick mine in an egg tray on a shelf in a cool, light room and watch anxiously as the shoots grow (if they look pale or weak, your room is likely too dark or warm). First earlies I like are ‘Red Duke of York’ and ‘Arran Pilot’. For early salad styles I favour ‘Pink Fir Apple’ and ‘International Kidney’ (the Jersey Royal root). But try to find a local Potato Day and Seed Fair (potato-days.net) and pick up a few that are new to you. If you are lucky enough to have apple and/or pear trees, February is when you need to mulch and finish winter pruning. Time, too, to cut autumn raspberries down and trim currant and gooseberry bushes. Now is also good for planting fruit trees if you have room, and to cover rhubarb crowns for an early ‘forced’ crop in March. It’s not all about work, though, I enjoy a good February dig, particularly if Howard’s around. Look for signs of spring, budding primrose, crocus, snowdrops, too. Take time to breathe it in.
