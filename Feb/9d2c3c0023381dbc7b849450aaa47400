If you aren’t a vegan, the idea of a chocolate pudding that substitutes tofu for delicious cream might seem a little, well, misguided. But this is one of those strange recipes that has to be tried to be believed. A delicate but satisfyingly creamy dessert that will delight vegans and non-vegans, alike – and perfect if you’re short of time. It’s important that you use silken tofu for this recipe, rather than the more solid form that is widely available. Health-food shops are a good place to look if you’re struggling to find it.
