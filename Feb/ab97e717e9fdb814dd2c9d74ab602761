The bitter cold gripping the American midwest is expected to turn into spring-like weather by early next week, according to forecasters. Just days after arctic conditions, temperatures are expected to climb by as much as 80 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions. Experts said the rapid thaw is unprecedented, and could create its own problems – bursting pipes, flooding rivers and crumbling roads. “I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen [such a big] shift in temperatures” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.” Already, the blast of cold air known as the polar vortex has killed at least 16 people, including a man found frozen in his backyard in a Milwaukee suburb on Thursday. Dozens of others were sent to hospitals in the region. At least 144 people in Illinois visited hospitals for cold-related injuries over two days. Most of the injuries were hypothermia or frostbite, according to a public health. The good news is the weekend will be great. 😊The bad news is, well, the dark blue blob of below normal is back next week. ☹️ pic.twitter.com/B7pzGJ2JdD The weather was caused by a blast of cold air from the North Pole being pushed south into North America. That made some parts of Illinois colder than Antarctica on Wednesday, and with the windchill factor made Los Angeles feel as much as 100 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than some parts of the midwest. Many places remained painfully cold on Thursday, including in western New York, where a storm brought face-stinging winds, sub-zero temperatures and up to 20in (51cm) of snow in some places. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. However, places such as Rockford, Illinois, where the mercury dropped to a record-setting -31F (-35C) on Thursday morning, should warm to 50F (10C) by Monday. The dramatic warm-up will offer respite from the bone-chilling cold which canceled school, closed businesses and halted trains. However, the same cycle could crack water mains, homeowners pipes and reveal potholes in roads. Scores of vehicles will be left with flat tires and bent rims. Masters, from Weather Underground, said the polar vortex was “rotating up into Canada” and not expected to return in the next couple of weeks. If it does return in late February, “it won’t be as intense.”
