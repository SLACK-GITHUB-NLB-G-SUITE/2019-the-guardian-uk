Ikea is trialling the sale of used, patched-up furniture in the UK as part of its efforts to become more environmentally friendly. An earlier trial in Edinburgh will be expanded to Glasgow in June. The Swedish retailer is also launching a textile recycling scheme across the UK. Ikea said the two schemes were a step towards creating a circular business model in which materials and products were reused or recycled. Customers in Edinburgh have been able to exchange used Ikea furniture for a reward voucher for more than a year. The items are refurbished and sold in the bargain area. The idea will be tested in Glasgow and the company is considering expanding the scheme elsewhere. Hege Sæbjørnsen, sustainability manager for Ikea in the UK, said the furniture and textile schemes were a step towards creating a greener operation. The company has launched a pilot scheme in Switzerland where it leases its products, although there are no immediate plans to bring it to the UK. “We are almost in startup mode, testing business models,” Sæbjørnsen said at the launch of Ikea’s greenest store yet in Greenwich, south London. As well as being run on 100% renewable energy including solar panels on its roof, the Greenwich store has space for workshops where locals can learn how to refurbish furniture. Sæbjørnsen said there was a lot of interest in learning how to fix items and developing these skills in the community was part of creating a culture around reusing and recycling. “We are building the foundations towards [leasing and reuse] so we can scale quickly,” she said. Ikea began testing textile recycling in Cardiff nearly two years ago Customers have been able to bring in old clothes, curtains or other furnishing fabrics to be repaired or cleaned and sent on to a homelessness project or recycled. Milton Keynes and Greenwich also offer the service, which will be extended to all UK stores over the next few months.
