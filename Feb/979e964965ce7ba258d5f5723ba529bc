Tens of thousands of Venezuelan protesters streamed on to the streets of the nation’s capital on Saturday for what they described as the final push to force Nicolás Maduro from power. “I believe [the end] is coming very soon – this week,” said Barbara Angarita, 49, as she and thousands of other demonstrators poured down the Avenida Principal de las Mercedes in Caracas. “We must have a free country, free for all Venezuelans and for our descendants.” “I feel we are on the verge of achieving our objective,” added Angarita, lifting aloft a placard that read: “We all have reasons to protest in peace.” Around her demonstrators broke out in chants of: “It’s going to fall, it’s going to fall, the government is going to fall.” Maria Vallera, from Petare, a sprawling slum in the city’s east, had brought a statue of the Virgin of the Valley to the march. “I’m 75 years old and I’ve never experienced a nightmare like this of hunger, misery and scarcity,” Vallera complained. “[But] today I feel cheerful and happy because we have a mission of faith and hope – with the Virgin of the Valley – that will help us recover the Venezuela of before, the one I used to know.” Protesters also streamed on to the streets in other major cities. “Look I think these are the final days,” said Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor who took to the streets of Barquisimeto, Venezuela’s fourth-largest city. Thousands of pro-Maduro supporters, many wearing red shirts, flocked to a rival march in central Caracas. “There are numerous problems that haven’t been solved yet,” said Gredy Arrieta, 19, a port worker who had travelled more than eight hours from the city of Maracaibo. “But he [Maduro] has done good and he has fought for the country.” On the wall beside him a government opponent had graffitied the word “tyranny” in large red letters.
