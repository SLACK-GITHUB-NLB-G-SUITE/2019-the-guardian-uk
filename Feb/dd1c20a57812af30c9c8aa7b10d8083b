Manchester United have revealed that José Mourinho and his staff received a £19.6m payoff following the Portuguese’s sacking at Old Trafford. The staggering sum was disclosed in figures released on Thursday in the club’s half-yearly accounts. It was called an “exceptional item relating to compensation to the former manager and certain members of the coaching staff for loss of office”. The other coaching staff thought to be compensated are senior goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, opposition scout Ricardo Formosinho, fitness coaches Stefano Rapetti and Carlos Lalin and analyst Giovanni Cerra, although Mourinho is expected to have received the bulk of the money. Mourinho earned around £15m a year but was removed 17 league matches into his third season, United having made their poorest start since 1990, sitting 19 points off the top of the table and 11 from a Champions League berth. Under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær the club have won 10 out of 12 matches in all competitions and are now fourth in the Premier League. In two full seasons at Old Trafford, Mourinho won the Europa League and League Cup before finishing second in the Premier League last season and reaching the FA Cup final, where United lost 1-0 to Chelsea. In the period since replacing Louis van Gaal, United’s spending stands at £364.3m on eight buys. The 56-year-old’s next move will be in broadcasting; he will host a fortnightly Champions League show on the Russian TV channel RTE called On the Touchline with José Mourinho, due to start on 7 March. Further details in the report showed the club’s broadcasting revenue increased by £28.5m (38%) over the prior year quarter while their total operating expenses rose by £24.1m (18%) to £160.3m. The club’s net debt was revealed to be £317.7m, a decrease of £10.9m on the previous year.
