The bodies of two men have been found in flood waters at Townsville in north Queensland. The two men, both in their early 20s, were discovered in a stormwater drain near the Aitkenvale library on Tuesday afternoon. On Monday police said two men aged 21 and 23 were missing after they were last seen on Ross River Road in Aitkenvale near flood waters on Monday morning. It’s understood police had been looking for the two men after an alleged break and enter in the area. “They were involved in another police investigation,” the state disaster co-ordinator and Queensland police deputy commissioner, Bob Gee, said. “I cannot confirm that any of them actually entered flood waters.” Queensland police are yet to confirm whether it is the same two men. The news comes as flood waters in Townsville slowly begin to recede on the 11th day since the record monsoonal rains began to hammer the north Queensland city. Thousands of people remain unable to return to their homes, with the State Emergency Service receiving almost 1,200 calls for help in the 48 hours up to Tuesday morning. Overnight, Bluewater Creek in the city’s north, copped 340mm of rain, with almost 100 calls for help to emergency service crews. A staggering 1.8m of rain has fallen on the suburb of Upper Blue Water over the past seven days. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said a recovery centre was opened in Townsville. She also ordered her agriculture minister to consult western mayors about help for farmers. “We’ve got a long way to go. I’m asking for people to have patience,” she said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, met with flood victims on Tuesday morning, and said he felt for families who’d lost so much. “A lot of young families, they’ve worked so hard to get themselves into these homes and to see them just damaged so badly, it must just be heartbreaking,” he said. So far almost 9,000 people have applied for personal hardship grants.
