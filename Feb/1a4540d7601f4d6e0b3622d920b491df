After one of the hottest summers ever in 2018 and a mild winter across much of Europe, record temperatures are suggesting spring is once more beginning earlier than usual. Swallows and house martins have been spotted more than a month earlier than usual and temperatures are up to 20C higher than this time last year. We’re looking for your help documenting signs of the situation where you are, and would like to see your pictures and hear about what you are seeing as well as how you feel about it. With every opportunity for short sleeves comes concern about the environment and climate change. How have things changed over time where you live? How do you feel about this? Tell us what the situation is like where you are in the form below. If you are sharing pictures please tell us where and when yours was taken – and if you have older photos for comparison, or can describe how things were in previous years, we’d be very interested. This callout is aimed at readers in the northern hemisphere, but if you have seen anything notable where you are in the southern hemisphere you can still tell us about it.
