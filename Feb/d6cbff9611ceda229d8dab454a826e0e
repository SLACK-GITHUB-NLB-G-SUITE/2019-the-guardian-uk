What on earth have Arsenal become? Or what are they even trying to become? These questions cut raggedly through the cold air as Unai Emery’s strange team toiled against Belarusian opponents who have been on a winter break and not played a competitive match for nine weeks. Bate Borisov still more than nullified the best this flawed Arsenal incarnation could offer and inflicted a defeat that was more worrying in its style than its result. There is a chance to overturn this result next week and Emery clung to that at the end of a chastening night. “We play another 90 minutes next week and I’m sure it’s going to be different. Our big chance, big challenge, is next week,” he said. “I trust in our players and in our stadium with our supporters.” Bate’s cheerful coach, Aleksei Baga, has his own ideas. “I am 100% sure we will achieve the big result next week,” he said. In a competition in which Emery has a personal history of triumph and that he is desperate to win for the dual prize of a trophy and the ticket back into Champions League, Arsenal suffered a defeat with no redeeming features. Low on creativity, high on the kind of sudden defensive lapses that cried out to be exploited for an enterprising opponent, their excursion ended with an extra blow as Alexandre Lacazette was sent off for catching Aleksandar Filipovic with a retaliatory elbow. Emery described that as “bad news” and expressed “the need to control frustration”. It speaks volumes for the scale of change since Arsenal visited the Borisov Arena in last season’s Europa League that out of the 18-man squad who came during Arsène Wenger’s final campaign only four travelled this time. Most of last season’s headline players here – Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere – feel part of a different era. The really complicated bit is that last year’s crop, who won 4-2 here, were unmistakably the B team, players who were struggling to get into Arsenal’s Premier League selection. This was Emery’s selection more or less at full strength, barring injuries and illness, and they found the going extremely heavy. Shaping a new Arsenal identity is not a particularly simple task in a squad who still have a transitional feel. Alex Iwobi and Sead Kolasinac were the pick of the bunch for Arsenal but overall they lacked precision and direction in too many departments. In a place famous for its tractor factory the pitch looked as if it might have been mown by one. Emery insisted the conditions would never be considered an excuse and his team started with a flash of speed and focus, working the goalkeeper in the second minute. Iwobi and Kolasinac combined to set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose shot was smothered by Denis Scherbitski. Little did they know that was about as good as it was going to get. If it gave a first impression Bate were not in the best possible shape that was soon shattered as they began to run with energetic intent at Arsenal’s defensive weak spots. The bubbly Maksim Skavysh enjoyed the freedom to drive forwards at a variety of angles and put pressure on the visitors, and the new signing Nemanja Milic was a handful. Arsenal struggled for a foothold, not able to control the midfield area against opponents who had the old maverick Alex Hleb ambling around like an elegant yet elderly deer. The 37-year-old had postponed his retirement for this tie, a sentimental decision for sure, but his teammates enthusiasm around him made it feel worthwhile and his soft foot shuffle was still in tune after all these years. Just before the break Arsenal’s defence was punctured and for a moment it felt like this little spaceship stadium in the middle of the Belarusian forest might take off. The Bate supporters were a picture of euphoric disbelief as Stanislav Dragun lost his marker and showed the aerial strength to glance in from a free-kick. Petr Cech made a handful of important saves to keep the scoreline down. Bate Borisov 1-0 Arsenal, Galatasaray 1-2 Benfica, Krasnodar 0-0 Leverkusen, Lazio 0-1 Sevilla, Olympiacos 2-2 Dynamo Kyiv, Rapid Vienna 0-1 Inter, Rennes 3-3 Real Betis , Slavia Prague 0-0 Genk, Celtic 0-2 Valencia, Club Brugge 2-1 Red Bull Salzburg, Malmo 1-2 Chelsea, Shakhtar Donetsk 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Sporting 0-1 Villarreal, Viktoria Plzen 2-1 Dinamo Zagreb, Zurich 1-3 Napoli Lacazette, who later apologised on Twitter for his red card, had the best of Arsenal’s chances but put a header over and saw another effort ruled out by the linesman’s flag. They will have to compensate for his suspension next week but also must locate some creativity to knit their game together. Emery was evasive on the subject of whether or not Mesut Özil will be back in his plans. “We can win with every player and lose with the same players,” he said. Arsenal must buck up their ideas to salvage the tie at the Emirates before they can begin to think more seriously about how far they are capable of going in this tournament. It all feels like backs-against-the-wall time in a competition that supposedly means so much. Letting the team down like that is the worst feeling..I should have stayed calm but it’s not always easy.. Sorry 😣There are still 90 minutes to play and I believe that my teammates will make it to the next round.. #COYG #Laca
