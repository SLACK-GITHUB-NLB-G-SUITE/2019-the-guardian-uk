Workers are trying to free an Amtrak train with 183 passengers aboard that has been stranded since Sunday night after hitting a tree that fell on the tracks near Eugene, Oregon. Amtrak’s Coast Starlight train left Seattle for Los Angeles early on Sunday but hit a tree in Oakridge, Oregon, about 6.20pm. Oakridge is about 45 miles (72km) south-east of Eugene. Over 38 hours since passengers first boarded, the train is now on the move again. It is being pulled by a Union Pacific train, and will end up back where it started, in Seattle. The plight of the passengers is not over yet, Amtrak warned there may be additional delays along the route because of weather conditions. Hey @amtrak does it really take this long to rescue stranded,passengers? Its been over 24 hours!!! @NBCNews @cnnbrk @ABC @fox12oregon pic.twitter.com/mHKWY4PDuN A number of passengers on board have been posting about their plight on social media. Rebekah Dodson wrote on Facebook that the long wait had gone by “in the blink of an eye” because there was so much commotion on the train, saying she was kept busy doing news interviews as well as “helping people out of panic attacks and chasing down toddlers”. Life Update: Been stuck on a train for 29 hours and counting trying to get back to school🙃 pic.twitter.com/1bLq4yhsC4 We have accepted our new life on the train. Tribes are forming. We are all walking thin. #stuckonamtrak Amtrak made the decision to keep passengers on the train because electricity is out in Oakridge. Amtrak said there is ample food on board. Passenger Carly Bigby told KOIN-TV parents have run out of diapers and there was limited cellphone service.
