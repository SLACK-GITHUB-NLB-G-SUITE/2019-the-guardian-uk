The Duke of Edinburgh will not be prosecuted after a car crash near Sandringham last month in which another motorist was injured. The Crown Prosecution Service has decided no further action should be taken against Prince Philip. The CPS statement did not name the prince but referred to “a driver involved in a collision on the A149 at Sandringham”. Last weekend Buckingham Palace said he had voluntarily surrendered his driving licence after the incident in which his Land Rover Freelander overturned. His vehicle was involved in a collision with a Kia being driven by Ellie Townsend, 28, as he drove out of a driveway on 17 January. Announcing the decision, Chris Long, the chief crown prosecutor for CPS East of England, said: “The CPS has carefully reviewed material submitted by the police in relation to a traffic collision on the A149 on 17 January this year. “We took into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving licence. We have decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute. “All those involved in the collision have been informed and provided with a full explanation in writing.” The CPS said the decision had been made after considering all the evidence submitted by the police and in accordance with the two-stage test in the code for crown prosecutors. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “The Duke of Edinburgh respects the decision taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.” Asked whether the Duke could drive on private land in future, the spokesperson added: “If the Duke of Edinburgh did drive on private land that would be in accordance with all relevant regulations.”
