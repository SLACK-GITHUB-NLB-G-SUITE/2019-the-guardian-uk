A Labour government would give everyone the right to choose when they do and do not work from the day they are employed, its shadow women and equalities secretary will tell Labour’s women’s conference on Saturday. “Women do the vast majority of unpaid care, but this must not be a barrier to women in work,” Dawn Butler will say. “That’s why I’m announcing Labour’s plans to introduce rights to flexible working from day one of employment. “This change to the law is essential to closing the gender pay gap and dismantling the structural barriers that hold women back from promotion and progression. It may also result in more men taking on caring responsibilities themselves, finally lightening the load that women bear. “Under Labour’s plans, no woman will be shut out of the workplace because they’re a mum or they care for a parent or a disabled loved one, or both. We need an economy that works for women, not against us.” The plans include requiring firms to allow workers to choose their working hours from the first day of employment under what would be a new flexible working right. The party cited an ONS survey that found about 46% of female sandwich carers – those who look after both young children and elderly or disabled relatives – “feel unable to work at all or as much as they would like”. Labour said the move would “help to tackle the gender pay gap and gender segregation in the workplace by increasing employment and promotion opportunities for women”. It believes further benefit could be derived from “reducing commuter congestion and reducing business costs such as office overheads”.
