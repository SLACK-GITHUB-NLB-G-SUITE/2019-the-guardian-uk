Lady Gaga has won the best original song Oscar for ‘Shallow’, the keynote track from A Star is Born. The widely-predicted victory, which she shared with co-writers Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt and Anthony Rossomando, was the film’s first award of the night. In her speech, Gaga thanked her director and co-star, Bradley Cooper, for “believing in us”. She added: “There is not a single person on the planet that could sing this song but you.” Gaga continued with a shout-out to aspirational artists watching the ceremony: “If you’re at home, and your seating on your couch, all I have to say is this is about hard work... I worked hard for a long time. It’s not about winning, it’s about not giving up. If you have a dream, fight for it”. Cooper and Gaga’s duet on ‘Shallow’ earlier in the ceremony proved one of the major talking points of the 2019 show, due to the closeness of the pair – and the camera.
