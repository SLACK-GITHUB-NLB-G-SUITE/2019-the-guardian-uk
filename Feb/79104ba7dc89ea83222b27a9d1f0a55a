Hong Kong is known for its flashing lights, neon signs and high-rise skylines. But the architect and photographer Hans Leo Maes documents an alternative side – the city’s interconnecting staircases and bridges. “The extreme population density in Hong Kong means [structures] are stacked and linked by stairs, often external and very visible,” Maes says. “These accidental aesthetics inspire and excite me. The city is in a constant state of flux and I think there is value in documenting disappearing structures or temporary conditions.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.
