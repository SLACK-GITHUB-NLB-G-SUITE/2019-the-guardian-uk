The myth of Bayern-Dusel has endured in German football for more than four decades – the concept of the perennial luck that pushes even the below-elite teams representing the Rekordmeister over the hump. It’s become such a Bundesliga cliché that Bastian Schweinsteiger reflected on one late winner in the closing stages of 2009-10 under Louis van Gaal as Bayern-Dusel being “back again” with a grin on his face. One wondered on Saturday afternoon if, in 2019, the concept of the luck of a behemoth is as possible as it once was. Bayern Munich were sticking to their script – the script of modern German football – as half-time approached at Bayer Leverkusen. They already led through Leon Goretzka’s latest goal and shortly after the home side’s teenage star Kai Havertz limped off, Robert Lewandowski looked to have put them two up, deftly flicking the ball wide of Lukas Hradecky and into the corner of the net from Kingsley Coman’s pass, the culmination of a razor-sharp move. The assistant’s flag, however, was up, much to Lewandowski’s incredulity and to Bayern’s, with Niko Kovač grumbling that VAR officials confirming the call “must have had the centimetre measure out”. It recalled the moment when José Mourinho used a press conference a few days after Real Madrid’s 2011 Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona to ridicule Pep Guardiola for being “a man who criticises the referee when he makes good decisions”. To repeat that barb about Kovač would be as wilfully deliberate a misunderstanding as Mourinho was making all those years over Barcelona. His lament didn’t even go as far as suggesting that calling a player for a fractional offside might be against the spirit of the law. It was simply an observation that it had been tight. When the tight calls aren’t going Bayern’s way, the concept of Dusel of any sort seems a little antiquated, just as their aura of invincibility has become this season. It all fell to bits after the break, beginning when Leon Bailey swerved a magnificent free-kick past Sven Ulreich – playing after Manuel Neuer injured his hand – for an equaliser, which was also the Jamaican’s first goal since the second game of the season. The tide turned, and Kevin Volland put the hosts in front before Lucas Alario rounded it off in the closing minutes. Those last two goals in particular exposed the holes in Bayern’s game that had been papered over in recent games, with Leverkusen’s counter-attacks (which promise to be a key element of the newly-inaugurated Peter Bosz era) just too fast for the visitors during a second half in which they faded and looked ponderous, as they often have this term. It was the fifth time already this season that Bayern have dropped points after taking the lead and this one, after a run of seven straight league victories leading into it, was probably the most shocking. There had been the feeling of a corner being turned, but that sentiment dissipated in the course of a visceral half-hour from the hosts. It was, as Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Sebastian Fischer wrote: “An indication of insufficient tactical flexibility for the highest level.” Kovač acknowledged as much after the match. Which was “good, because he’s responsible for analysis”, continued Fischer, “but bad, because as a coach he’s also responsible for the tactics. He’s a coach, mind you, who stands for defensive stability”. Kovač’s moves over the winter break were supposed to cement that, with his confirmation of Niklas Süle as the team’s No 1 centre-half, and with Mats Hummels and Jérôme Boateng fighting it out to partner him – Hummels has won the vote so far in 2019. Here, he represented Bayern’s unevenness, which has become the shadow hanging over their season. On Saturday Hummels often looked his best self on the ball; elegant, ambitious, a cut above. Off it – sometimes after giving it away himself – he looked uncertain of his position, and even lost. Leverkusen knew exactly how to take advantage. “Going forward, our team has great qualities,” argued Kovač, “but we have to shut up shop. Everyone knows the championship is won at the back.” Some would argue that therein lies the problem, with a coach who is thinking of being cautious rather than daring. Then again, if those principles were followed more closely, it’s difficult to argue that Bayern wouldn’t be in a better position.

Certainly, if Kovač wants his team to defend from the front then Lewandowski is short-changing him. He is not the only one, with Thomas Müller and James Rodríguez substituted in the second half and looking glum about it. That Lewandowski is still in Bavaria, having openly coveted a move to Real Madrid, might be taken as an admission of shortcoming, but he looks short of the all-round game which would propel him back into those sort of conversations. Maybe a rebuild around him would make the difference. That is firmly on the Bayern agenda, though the plan to freshen the squad this winter didn’t come to fruition, with Lucas Hernández staying at Atlético for now and Benjamin Pavard still at Stuttgart until summer. One can’t hope for more than a period of adaptation from Alphonso Davies. Yet it means for now that the squad is limited, certainly in terms of variety, with Sandro Wagner moving to China last week – not that Kovač was keen on picking him anyway. Borussia Dortmund failed to land a knockout blow this weekend, and Bayern still have their hopes alive. With Leverkusen exposing them like this, though, concern is beginning to turn to what Liverpool might do to a team still incapable of producing 90 minutes of energy and focus, when the Champions League restarts. • Dortmund, then, extended their lead to seven points despite letting a lead slip – and failing to take a host of chances to restore it – in an entertaining draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Marco Reus, who opened the scoring before Luka Jović levelled, was the chief culprit. Goalkeeper Roman Bürki grudgingly called Bayern’s stumble “a small consolation”, though cameras preferred to focus on Axel Witsel struggling to supress a grin as the score from Leverkusen popped up on the big screen. • Borussia Mönchengladbach are up to second after chiselling out a 2-0 win at Schalke with late goals by Christoph Kramer and Florian Neuhaus, the second being an extraordinary piece of work, the result of 62 passes over two minutes and 45 seconds of possession.
