Students at a New Zealand university will become the first in the country to get free drug testing during “orientation week” before the university semester begins. Otago University Students Association (OUSA) is offering pill testing from Wednesday to allow students to check whether their recreational drugs contain what they think they do, and have not been mixed with potentially dangerous substances. The association has reiterated that the drug-testing is not foolproof and that the safest option is to abstain completely. Drug testing is increasingly being used at music festivals around the country, as part of a trend supported by the government but criticised as promoting drug culture by the opposition National party. Green party MP Chlöe Swarbrick said drug testing was in line with a health-based approach to illegal drug use, and was a positive step towards drug harm reduction. The Drug Foundation of New Zealand, which is taking part in the testing, also applauded the move. OUSA chief executive Debbie Downs described the decision as a “bold and pre-emptive move” designed to keep students safe. “First and foremost, OUSA in no way condones drug use of any kind, but in the day and age we live in, we are cognisant of the need for harm prevention,” Downs said. The drug testing was not on university land or endorsed by Otago university, a university spokeswoman said. “The university does not endorse either the use of illegal drugs or the drug testing initiative led by the NZ Drug Foundation, but has no plans to interfere in the detail of OUSA’s welfare and support delivery,” she said. Otago students canvassed by the university’s student magazine, Critic, largely welcomed the move. “Would probably rather take MD than paint thinners” one student told the magazine. According to the Drug Foundation young people aged 18-25 have the highest rate of drug use of any age group in the country.
