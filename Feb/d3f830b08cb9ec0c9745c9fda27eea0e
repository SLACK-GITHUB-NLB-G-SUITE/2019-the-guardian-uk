The actor Juliette Binoche has called for an end to the public excoriation of Harvey Weinstein and said that the cases should now be left to the courts. Speaking at the opening press conference for the Berlin film festival, where she is heading the jury, Binoche said that she had encountered no problems in her long relationship with the producer, who has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault. He denies all incidents of non-consensual sex. “I almost want to say peace to his mind and heart, that’s all,” said Binoche. “I’m trying to put my feet in his shoes. He’s had enough, I think. A lot of people have expressed themselves. Now justice has to do its work. “I never had problems with him, but I could see that he had problems. As a producer he was wonderful, most of the time. I think he was a great producer. That we shouldn’t forget, even though it’s been difficult for some directors and actors and especially actresses. I just want to say peace to his mind and let justice do what it needs to do.” Binoche worked with Weinstein on Chocolat and The English Patient, for which she won an Oscar. Speaking in 2017, Binoche said being assaulted at the age of 18 by another producer had equipped her to deal with Weinstein, saying she “learned early to be responsible”. “I knew very well what beast there was in him,” she continued. “The kind of guy I will never go to have fun with. I had lunch with him once one-on-one in his suite. I did not feel any danger, but I did not understand why he wanted to see me.” Weinstein is facing trial on a sexual assault charge in New York, and has been under investigation in Los Angeles and London.
