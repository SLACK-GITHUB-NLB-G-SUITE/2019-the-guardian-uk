It was a suitcase that inspired photographer Anja Niemi’s icy, enigmatic series Darlene & Me. The case belonged originally to a beauty consultant named Darlene and contained old jars of cream, powders and brochures. But the thing that piqued Niemi’s interest after she bought it was a receipt from August 1960: Darlene had sold a jar of Liquid Beauty and one Temptress’s Hairspray, both to herself. “It left me with a feeling of a woman’s failed attempt at success,” says Niemi. “I started to picture her alone, being both beauty consultant and customer, and this led me to my fictional version of Darlene and her relationship to herself.” The image here comes towards the end of the visual short story, after the two characters’ stay in an extravagant desert house and before the final image, in which one buries the other under the shadow of a Joshua tree. The macabre series is one of six collected in the Norwegian photographer’s book In Character, each inspired by a different, pre-owned object. The photographer is her own model: she spends months filling a costume shed with the clothes and belongings of each new persona, then attires herself in them and takes the photos, always alone. “Some people like to hike up mountains to feel exhilarated; I like to dress up in big wigs and flamboyant costumes,” she says. “My wardrobe is pretty neutral in real life. I have always been drawn to the act of transformation – as a kid, dressing up made me really happy. Now I get to do it for a living.” Occasionally, her characters’ stories take an unexpected turn: here, instead of an elegant blond woman, the car’s rearview mirror shows a beast-like reflection. “Sometimes strange, inexplicable things happen in images, and I am always drawn to them,” says Niemi. “The animal in the mirror is a mystery, like an unintentional shape shifter.” Anja Niemi: In Character (£24.95, Thames & Hudson) is published on 7 February
