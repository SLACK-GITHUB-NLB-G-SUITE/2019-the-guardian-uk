Russian environmental authorities have deployed a team of specialists to a remote Arctic region to sedate and remove dozens of hungry polar bears that have besieged the people living there.The move came after officials in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, with a population of about 3,000 people, appealed for help. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been such a mass invasion of polar bears,‚Äù said Zhigansha Musin, the head of the local administration. ‚ÄúThey have literally been chasing people.‚Äù üèîÔ∏è–ë–µ–ª—ã–π –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å - —Ö–æ–∑—è–∏–Ω –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–ø–µ–ª–∞–≥–∞! üåè –ú–æ–∂–µ—Ç –∑–∞–≥–ª—è–Ω—É—Ç—å –∏ –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–∏–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è!)))) #–Ω–æ–≤–∞—è–∑–µ–º–ª—è #—Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ #–±–µ–ª—ã–π–º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å #–ø–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–π–º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å #–∫—Ä–∞—Å–æ—Ç–∞ #–∂–∏–∑–Ω—å–Ω–∞–∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ–º—Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–µ #—Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä #–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ #–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–ø–µ–ª–∞–≥ #russia #newland #beauty #north #borealis #polarlights #myworld A post shared by  Irina Elis MURMANSK, RUSSIA (@muah_irinaelis) on Feb 4, 2019 at 2:42am PST Alexander Minayev, the region‚Äôs deputy head, added: ‚ÄúPeople are scared, and afraid to leave their homes.

Attempts to scare off the polar bears using car horns and dogs have all failed, the Tass news agency said. Russia classes polar bears as an endangered species and shooting them is prohibited by law. Officials warn, however, that a cull may be necessary to ensure the safety of the local population, if attempts to remove the animals fail. In 2016, five Russian scientists were besieged by polar bears for nearly two weeks at a remote weather station on Troynoy Island, east of Novaya Zemlya.
