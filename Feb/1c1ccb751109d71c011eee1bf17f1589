Recorded at the end of November, premiered on the radio a few days later and due for imminent release, The Human Stone by producer KDA is either brand new or 54 years old, depending on whether you factor in the ages of its constituent elements: the track comprises Angie Stone’s 2001 single Wish I Didn’t Miss You and the Human League’s 1981 behemoth The Sound of the Crowd. The truth lies somewhere in between. The song’s origins are in KDA’s former residency at Fabric’s DTPM night, where he’d sample tracks and create mashups on the fly. “People used to come up and say: ‘What the fuck is this Angie Stone remix?’” he remembers. That was in 2006. KDA’s excuse for the delay? “I’m working through a backlog.” This could be KDA’s second No 1 single, though he originally planned to release it anonymously. In December he sent it to Annie Mac, who made it her Hottest Record, but she also misread the email and announced it as the new KDA single, live on national radio. So that was that. The next morning, within 12 hours of the premiere, KDA had a label demanding to release the track. Then US radio started getting in touch. In any case, Angie Stone’s a fan – her response, KDA reports, was: “You guys in the UK listen to some crazy shit … I LOVE IT!” Stunning reaction to The Human Stone being made Hottest Record In The World at the weekend by @AnnieMac on @BBCR1 - What a way to start a year 🏆😎🎈You can listen again from 30.35: https://t.co/OrAcFd2l5o#HottestRecordInTheWorld #TheHumanStone #AngieStone #TheHumanLeague pic.twitter.com/KPDCLc9U33 The elderly among us will inevitably find ourselves reminiscing over the early-2000s bootleg scene, with hindsight the inevitable consequence of MP3 blogs, filesharing, and early hints that access to infinite music libraries would change genre-based, and era-based, habits. The Freelance Hellraiser’s A Stroke of Genius (The Strokes v Christina Aguilera) was one mashup that picked up momentum; Eminem’s label sent out cassettes of The Real Slim Shady mixed with Britney’s Oops! … I Did It Again. It was a time when no a cappella was safe from being chucked on top of Billie Jean. Fans would hear mashups in clubs such as Trash, or at dedicated bootleg nights, or they’d pick them up on blogs. By 2002 the scene, made up of amateurs as well as established producers such as Soulwax and Stargate, had exploded, MTV had launched its own dedicated mashup show, and Kylie opened the Brits with Can’t Get Blue Monday Out of My Head. Later that year, Sugababes took what had once been a Richard X bootleg to No 1 as Freak Like Me (although the 21st century’s first mashup No 1 was arguably Cliff Richard’s Millennium Prayer: the Lord’s Prayer sung over Auld Lang Syne). “It was a crazy time,” Richard X says today. “Labels were going: ‘We have no idea what the scene is about. Just come and ransack our catalogues.’ It was co-opted very quickly, and it quickly became ‘not cool’, but it was too big for that to matter.” Madonna’s people wanted tracks; P Diddy flew Richard to Ibiza to stay on his private yacht. There was an encounter with Janet Jackson: “We had a meeting at the Virgin Records offices, during which, in my enthusiasm, I fell over a knee-high table.” The scene moved on, and more inventive participants such as Richard, the Freelance Hellraiser’s Roy Kerr and Jacknife Lee carved out careers in conventional production work. The clubs and the blogs are no more, and most bootlegs now exist only in the memory of listeners to Xfm’s The Remix, or as 128kbps MP3s residing on hard drives liberated from long-since-binned laptops. In the case of Cornershop’s Brimful of Asha being mixed with Busted’s Year 3000, that’s probably for the best. But the reaction to The Human Stone suggests two things: firstly, that in a pop era defined by streaming and algorithms, the right radio play by the right DJ can still make a hit, or at least get the cogs moving. Secondly, there might still be a place for the euphoria induced by a great bootleg’s ability to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. It has taken KDA slightly by surprise. “The internet’s shouting at me: WHY HAVEN’T YOU PUT THIS OUT YET?” he laughs. “And it’s because I’m binge-watching Benidorm.” Could The Human Stone conjure a 2019 reboot scene? KDA has modest aims. “It’s easy to look back with rose-tinted glasses, but I remember the haircuts of people who were into bootlegs. Shameful, regretful haircuts.” He pauses. “It would be good, this time round, if people could be into bootlegs and also get laid.” Main composite: Mark Mainz/Getty; Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock; Keystone USA; WireImage; Kevin Winter; Redferns
