The high court has brought Sir Philip Green’s legal action against the Daily Telegraph to an end, with the newspaper saying it will publish allegations of bullying and sexual harassment against the retail tycoon “in the coming days”. The Topshop boss had been granted a temporary injunction blocking the Daily Telegraph from publishing allegations of misconduct made by five employees, who had all received substantial payments and signed non-disclosure agreements after settling their claims. Last week, Green said he wanted to drop the case because it was “pointless” after the Labour peer Peter Hain had used parliamentary privilege to name him in the House of Lords. In a ruling on Friday, Justice Warby granted Green permission to discontinue the proceedings. In a statement, Green and the board of his Arcadia Group said they were pleased with the high court judgment and accused the Telegraph of pursuing a “vendetta”. “The Telegraph has pursued a vendetta against Sir Philip Green and the employees and management of Arcadia Group for the past nine months, harassing many of its staff and their families at their homes, often at night and at weekends.” He called on the Telegraph and its owners, the Barclay brothers, to do the “decent thing” and respect the non-disclosure agreements the former employees had signed and not publish the story. “If not they will expose their sources to potential further legal actions and significant losses,” the statement said. In its coverage of the dropping of the legal action the Daily Telegraph said it would publish its story on Green in the coming days and estimated his legal bill to be about £3m, some of which includes covering the Telegraph’s legal costs. The Telegraph says the judge ordered Green to pay the “bulk” of these.
