There are a few ways to try to find out whether someone is single this Valentine’s Day. You could ask about their marital status, but that won’t necessarily satisfy your curiosity – just because someone checks “single” when they file their taxes doesn’t mean they are. The US census bureau has a similar problem. It frequently uses the words “single” and “umarried” interchangeably, but of course, the two don’t necessarily go together any more, given that US marriage rates have halved since the 70s. There’s another imperfect indicator you could use: you could ask whether your crush lives alone. Of course, plenty of people who live alone are in relationships and many people who don’t live alone are single. But it’s still an interesting variable for this Valentine’s Day. Almost 36 million people live in one-person households, according to 2018 data from the census bureau – that number represents one in every four people in the country. It wasn’t always this way. Back in 1960, just 13% of households had only one person living in them. It’s not just the US, though: the share of one-person households has more than doubled in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and many European countries. Demographers say it’s an important social and economic shift that is being overlooked. But back to that crush. Forget the statistical investigations – just ask them if they’re into you.
