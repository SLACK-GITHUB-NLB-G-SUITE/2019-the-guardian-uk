Dwain Chambers’ shock decision to come out of retirement at the age of 40 to race at this weekend’s British Indoor Championships has been welcomed by Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who says it is good for the sport. Chambers, who last ran in a GB vest in 2014, remains a controversial figure because he received a two-year ban for doping in 2004 – although he subsequently apologised, paid back a six-figure prize-money sum and now gives talks about the dangers of drugs. Mitchell-Blake, who ran the anchor leg when Britain’s 4x100m team won gold at the 2017 world championships, insisted he had no concerns going up against Chambers in the 60m on Saturday despite his past. “I’m comfortable racing against anyone who is in the seven lanes beside me,” he said. “Everyone has a past and everyone has a future. I’m not here to judge, I’m here to race. “I am a fan of the sport and Dwain himself. He is a world indoor [2010] and European champion [2006], and European record holder over 60m [2009] … 6.42sec is not a bad time and not many have gone faster. I have spoken to him in the past and got tips on how to get better in the 60m.” Chambers is seen by many to have a live shot at qualifying for next month’s European championships in Glasgow and needs to finish in the top two and run 6.60sec or less against a field that includes Mitchell-Blake and Richard Kilty, the 2014 world indoor champion. However Mitchell-Blake, who has moved to Florida to work with the US sprint coach Lance Baumann, trainer of the 200m runner Noah Lyles, Tyson Gay and Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith, says he is relishing the prospect of showing what he can do. “I’ve been training intensely since October so it’s an opportunity to see where I’m at. I’m excited for it.” Those also in action in Birmingham include the European gold medallist Laura Muir, who runs in the 3,000m final on Saturday, and the heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who contests the 60m hurdles and long jump.
