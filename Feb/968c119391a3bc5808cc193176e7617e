The US rapper Rich the Kid has been targeted in an armed robbery at a studio where he was recording a track with R&B star Usher. Eyewitnesses to the incident reported as many as 10 gunshots being fired during the incident outside Westlake Recording Studio in west Hollywood, Los Angeles. A police report states: When deputies arrived at the location they found three male black assault victims. The victims stated three male black suspects confronted them in the alley behind a business and demanded their money and jewellery. The victims were then physically assaulted by the suspects.  All the suspects got into a vehicle and drove away, westbound from the location. As the suspects drove away, a shooting occurred by an unknown male suspect. The shooting suspect has not been located or identified. The statement did not name Usher or Rich the Kid, real name Dimitri Roger, but TMZ reports that police officers said Usher was inside the studio and unharmed, while representatives for Roger said he was “doing OK” in the wake of the attack. One of Roger’s entourage was treated for injuries at the scene after being beaten with a firearm. Rich the Kid reached No 2 in the US charts last year with his debut album The World is Yours, which featured the hit single Plug Walk. He performed at the Brit awards in 2017 with Kendrick Lamar. In June 2018, Roger was hospitalised following another armed robbery at the home of his girlfriend, Tori Brixx, when assailants reportedly stole cash and jewellery. “Watch for the fakes & snakes the more money the more hate,” he wrote on Instagram following his discharge from hospital.
