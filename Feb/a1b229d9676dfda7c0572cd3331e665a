Rangers opened up a five-point gap to third-placed Aberdeen with a 4-2 win at Pittodrie on an eventful evening for Alfredo Morelos: the striker scored two first-half goals, missed a glorious chance to clinch his hat-trick and moments later was sent off – his third red card this season against Aberdeen. Two goals from Sam Cosgrove and a coolly converted James Tavernier penalty kept the excitement high in a seesawing contest. Morelos was red-carded in the second half for his part in a tussle with Scott McKenna, for which the Aberdeen defender also got his marching orders, before Jermain Defoe rounded off the scoring late on. “For Alfredo to improve he will have to channel his aggression,” said Steven Gerrard. “But I’m doing everything in my power to help the kid grow as a footballer and as a person.” Celtic overcame Hibernian thanks to a clinical Ryan Christie finish and a second from Oliver Burke – Christie turning provider – to maintain their six-point lead at the top. Emilio Izaguirre was carried off late on. Two goals from Andrew Nelson were only enough to give Dundee a 2-2 draw against Kilmarnock, who remain fifth on goal difference. Hamilton stayed ahead of second-bottom Dundee after a pair of poacher’s finishes from George Oakley steered them to a 2-1 victory over St Johnstone, and Motherwell climbed to seventh with a win by the same scoreline at rock-bottom St Mirren. A stunning early goal from 19-year-old Jake Hastie was answered by Paul McGinn’s looping header before Allan Campbell sealed a win that keeps the Saints at the foot of the table by three points.
