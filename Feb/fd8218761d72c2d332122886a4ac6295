If you are single and looking for a cool new way to meet people, Samsung has just the thing. The electronics company recently launched Refrigerdating, a service that matches you with dates based on what is inside your fridge. It’s like Tinder but you swipe through pictures of food, rather than faces. “We hope people can meet under more honest or transparent circumstances with the help of the contents of the fridge, because that can tell you a lot about the personality,” a PR manager explained. Speaking of transparent, Samsung didn’t launch this site for the love of matchmaking; it is a promotional tactic for its multi-thousand-pound smart fridges. At this point I would like to point out that smart fridges are one of the stupidest things to come out of the modern world. It has been said cocaine is God’s way of telling you that you have too much money; I reckon internet-connected fridges are God’s way of telling you that you should be paying more taxes. Despite my hatred for smart fridges, I selflessly joined Refrigerdating for research purposes. I soon learned that Cilla from Stockholm is into oat milk, Nico from Stockholm has a large eggplant and Patrick from Stockholm only eats condiments. Disappointingly, I didn’t match with anybody, which may be because there only seem to be about 15 users and they are probably all employees of Samsung Sweden. Nevertheless, I enjoyed peering into strangers’ fridges far more than I had anticipated. Not to sound like a fridge fetishist, but Samsung is really on to something here; my gut says it should go further with the concept. How about an app that matches people based on their willingness to consume food with mould on it? It could be called Can You Stomach Me? and I think Theresa May, for one, would really be into it.
