Between 1873 and 1876, Vincent van Gogh spent a formative period in south London. Then a trainee art dealer, he liked to wander around the city on foot; there are stories, possibly apocryphal, of him walking as far as Brighton and Ramsgate. When photographer Niall McDiarmid found himself in south London last month, he started to wonder what Van Gogh’s life in the area might have been like and set about retracing the artist’s footsteps for a photographic series, In Search of Van Gogh. It led him to various locations around Stockwell, Brixton and Lambeth: pubs, shops, a school called Van Gogh Primary. One afternoon, the project took McDiarmid to a quiet cafe; he was struck by the scene’s clashing walls, the mismatched chairs. “I’m very influenced by colour, shape and pattern,” he says. “I’m drawn to places that hark back to an earlier time, which are maybe a bit run-down.” McDiarmid’s series was inspired by the forthcoming Tate Britain show, Van Gogh and Britain, which opens on 27 March, two days before Britain is due to leave the EU. The project assumes added significance when viewed as a way of exploring being an outsider in London. “It reminded me of coming to London for the first time, from a very small village in Scotland, when I was about the same age as him,” says McDiarmid. “From what I read it was a happy time for him; he probably wasn’t burdened by the things that later in life broke him a little bit.” “Maybe,” says McDiarmid in the Instagram caption for this image, “if Vincent had his time again, he would have stayed in Stockwell, opened a little greasy spoon and called it Cafe Van Gogh.”
