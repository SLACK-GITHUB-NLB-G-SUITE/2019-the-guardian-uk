Talks in Washington on security issues at the US-Mexico border and how to agree on funding measures to avert another US government shutdown on Friday have broken down over immigration detention policies, a Republican senator said on Sunday. “Talks are stalled right now,” Republican Senator Richard Shelby told “Fox News Sunday” citing a dispute over immigrant detentions. He said he hoped negotiators would return to the table soon. Politicians from both sides of the aisle hinted late last week that a bipartisan agreement could be reached before this weekend, but as Friday closed out that had not happened and things went quiet. On Sunday morning, it emerged that talks have broken down and are at an impasse, the Washington Post reported, citing unnamed members of congress. Moments earlier, on CNN, Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said: “I hope we are not headed for another shutdown. I think there is bipartisan agreement about securing the border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [Democrat of California] is out there on her own, saying a wall is immoral and she won’t allow $1 for a wall....there will have to be funding for some sort of barrier.” CNN’s State of the Union show host, Jake Tapper, asked Cheney if she’d be happy with $2bn for ‘border security’, as a compromise, compared with the Donald Trump’s demand for $5.7bn for a wall. She says she wouldn’t negotiate that on TV. Reuters contributed to this report. More details follow…
